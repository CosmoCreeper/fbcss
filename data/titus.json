biblical studies "],["18.59","and a minor in sports and recreation "],["22.58","administration my minor wasn't "],["25.85","counseling or missions or Greek or "],["28.7","teaching it was sports and rec and now "],["32.75","you're probably scratching your head "],["34.04","wondering how did the sports and rec guy "],["37","get to be the pastor well actually the "],["40.25","sports administration was where I "],["41.51","developed some leadership skills and on "],["43.55","my overall philosophy of leadership was "],["47.27","where I learned how to build something "],["49.19","that outlast me back in 1993 as the "],["54.41","youth pastor people's church in Toronto "],["56.69","viscosa and church housed a small "],["59.21","Christian school the school had no real "],["61.76","sports program to speak up just "],["63.32","haphazardly competed against a couple "],["65.899","other Christian schools they practiced "],["67.55","in gym class once a week and played a "],["69.56","few games during the season that wasn't "],["72.71","my idea of a team or a season and I "],["74.899","wanted to put my passion for sports to "],["78.229","good use and I wanted to use it to "],["79.76","mentor kids through the venue of sports "],["82.82","so I set out to build a basketball "],["84.729","program I found some gym space because "],["87.32","they didn't have a gym in the school and "],["88.64","then we started practicing four days a "],["90.77","week and I organized the game schedule "],["92.9","that actually went from november to "],["94.88","februari and i got to send a bunch of "],["96.26","tournaments in the upcoming years we got "],["98.45","into the public school league competed "],["100.76","for our County's regional tournament "],["103.729","ultimately put the goal of becoming the "],["105.85","provincial champs sort of like state "],["109.189","champs but in Canada where you have "],["111.02","provinces a couple of years nobody "],["113.99","really knew or cared what we were doing "],["116.39","is just pastor Robb running around in "],["118.22","the church van with some teenagers but "],["120.47","before too long some of the folks would "],["122.81","come out to the games and parents "],["124.67","started coming out and they realized wow "],["126.439","these boys are pretty good at this and "],["128.78","this is a lot of fun and the year we "],["131.18","made it to the provincial championship "],["132.98","we had a whole entourage of people "],["135.38","traveling four or five hours down to "],["137.18","Cape Breton to cheer for us the girls "],["140.84","coach followed my lead and did the exact "],["142.79","same thing with the girls program and "],["144.95","many of the boys also like to play "],["146.9","soccer so they asked me if I would "],["148.79","make the soccer program more competitive "],["150.829","so I took over that program and revamped "],["153.23","it as well and in the seven years that I "],["155.599","was there at the school we went from not "],["157.579","having any program to developing a "],["160.129","competitive teams in soccer and "],["161.93","basketball and while I never personally "],["164.87","won the championship I did turn them "],["169.22","into a dominant team by the time I left "],["172.519","we were ranked in the top five teams in "],["175.22","the province but more importantly I "],["178.219","established a highly competitive culture "],["180.68","in the school that continued long past "],["183.5","my seven years for almost 20 years now "],["186.53","that little school that probably has no "],["188.75","more than 50 kids total in the high "],["191.329","school continues to be a dominant force "],["193.43","in the province of Nova Scotia the kids "],["195.439","that I coach now have their children in "],["197.45","the program and are running at the exact "],["199.579","same way so i must admit in two thousand "],["202.01","when i resigned from serving at people's "],["203.48","church i was sad to leave my little "],["204.829","sports ministry program which i poured "],["207.109","so much of myself into and i was also "],["209.569","concerned that it might not last once i "],["212.78","was gone would it just revert back to "],["214.579","its previous state of nothingness but i "],["219.68","was very happy to say that looking back "],["222.19","at it now it continues and it has even "],["225.25","advanced beyond what i did and they have "],["228.29","won a couple of provincial championships "],["230.09","for that school but i'm very happy to "],["232.94","see that and to facts of life are proven "],["235.37","with this little story for you this "],["236.599","morning fact number one everyone "],["238.79","everyone eventually gets replaced and "],["246.94","most of the times the thing that you "],["249.229","have worked hard to build you want to "],["252.56","outlive you continue on and be "],["255.53","successful even when you are long gone "],["258.039","most people like that now sometimes "],["260.18","people get mad and leave it a fight and "],["261.65","they're bitter and they want everything "],["262.58","to fall apart as vindication to their "],["264.56","personal greatness but if you sincerely "],["267.169","built something to be a blessing to "],["269.27","others you don't want to see it crumble "],["271.07","these are the facts they ring true here "],["275.27","in Titus chapter 3 as we wrap up this "],["279.38","book we see here in verse number 12 "],["282.71","just some final conclusions chapter 3 "],["285.98","verse 12 Paul says when I said Artemis "],["288.53","or tick I headed the first service just "],["295.73","lost it titik us to you if I sent "],["298.73","Artemis art indicus to you make every "],["301.61","effort to come to me at Nike opolis for "],["305.99","I've decided to spend the winner there "],["307.64","diligently help Xena's the lawyer Anna "],["309.83","Paulus on their way so that nothing is "],["313.13","lacking for them our people must also "],["315.68","learn to engage in good deeds to meet "],["318.44","pressing needs so that they will not be "],["320.9","unfruitful all who are with me greet you "],["324.8","greet those who love us in the faith "],["327.35","grace be with you all the interesting "],["331.67","events surrounding Paul's time in the "],["333.53","island of Crete the stop at Crete was "],["336.77","not an intentionally plan missionary "],["339.5","trip Paul stay in Crete happened when he "],["342.59","was on a prison ship on his way to Rome "],["345.83","to plead his case before Caesar the ship "],["348.8","basically got hung over there due to bad "],["351.77","weather if you read acts chapter 27 "],["354.92","verse 6 through 13 it gives the account "],["357.35","of how they just basically got stuck "],["359.33","there and we're forced to try to head to "],["362.63","stay over there for a while we don't "],["364.13","know how long they were there but long "],["366.41","enough for Paul to evangelize and plant "],["369.41","a church now Paul planted a church in "],["371.41","Thessalonica in two weeks so it really "],["374.06","doesn't take him long to evangelize and "],["376.55","get a church up and running he plants "],["378.98","the church and then he leaves Titus to "],["381.23","set things in order Paul left Creek "],["383.99","traveled to Rome was in prison there for "],["386.48","two years waiting for his court date "],["388.16","with Caesar during that time Paul wrote "],["391.01","the prison epistles which are made no "],["396.02","one Ephesians Philippians Colossians and "],["403.39","Philemon those who your prison epistles "],["406.87","Paul was released from prison wrote "],["409.52","first Timothy and Titus and we see here "],["413.54","from verse number 12 that Paul is free "],["416.6","and he's made "],["417.28","some travel arrangements he wants Titus "],["420.19","to meet him wear Nike opolis right the "],["423.85","city of victory or the city of athletic "],["427.419","footwear but Paul is giving Titus "],["430.3","instructions to come join him there so "],["433.69","what we deduce is that Paul and a group "],["436.36","were on their way to Rome they got hung "],["438.4","over in Crete they evangelize there Paul "],["441.16","decided to leave Titus to be the pastor "],["443.2","this new church Titus has been in Crete "],["445.09","for over two years but now he's going to "],["447.61","leave and Paul is giving him these "],["449.32","instructions to make sure everything is "],["451.63","up and running because Titus is leaving "],["454.33","soon is Titus coming back dono right "],["459.34","back in those days you couldn't be "],["461.11","precise with dates people travel too far "],["463.3","off lands and they never know when they "],["465.16","would return we're going to Guatemala on "],["467.23","the sixth we will be back don't know "],["469.63","good luck faith bible church you know "],["471.91","keep it together till we return no we "],["473.74","don't do it that way right we say we're "],["474.94","going to six and we're going to be back "],["476.229","to 12 and we can do that but back then "],["477.88","they couldn't do that why because "],["480.31","they're traveling by boat right and you "],["481.81","could get shipwrecked which Paul did or "],["483.43","you can get blown over here you could "],["484.63","get stuck someplace for the winter so "],["486.19","you never really knew how long a trip "],["488.919","was going to be whoever was left behind "],["491.26","was just given their instructions and "],["493.63","they were supposed to be diligent about "],["495.19","what they were doing and they were to be "],["496.87","faithful and they were to wait patiently "],["498.91","until ever got back and that's a "],["502.169","reoccurring theme in Scripture "],["504.37","pertaining to the second coming of Jesus "],["507.13","isn't it right jesus told His disciples "],["509.5","in John 14 verses 1 through 3 let not "],["512.289","your heart be troubled believe in God "],["513.669","believe also me in my father's house are "],["515.95","many mansions if it were not so I would "],["518.589","have told you I go to prepare a place "],["521.289","for you and if i go to repair a place "],["523.599","for you I will come again and receive "],["525.88","you unto myself that where I am there ye "],["529.6","may be also but for those original "],["533.17","disciples he didn't come again and "],["535.089","receive them the return was delayed all "],["538.03","the disciples were martyred for the "],["540.1","faith and jesus never came back to get "],["542.05","them the last Disciple John the Beloved "],["544.21","in his old age received a revelation of "],["547.45","Jesus with the exact same message behold "],["549.88","I come "],["551.05","quickly jesus said and yet that coming "],["553.72","is still been delayed now Jesus did for "],["557.589","shadow this long delay this uncertainty "],["560.92","of his return in the parables like the "],["563.56","parable of the ten virgins remember the "],["565.42","ten virgins there was they were all "],["567.519","waiting for the bridegroom to come and "],["569.17","the point was is you didn't know when "],["571","the bridegroom was going to come you had "],["572.26","to have the oil you had to be ready in "],["573.64","five head the oil and we're ready in "],["575.11","five were not and they miss the coming "],["578.47","or the parable of the master who went "],["580.93","away with the with the talents remember "],["583.39","he gave the talents out to different "],["584.68","servants and he said to them you know "],["586.899","take my wealth and use it wisely and he "],["589.6","went away for a long time they did not "],["591.91","know when he was going to be back the "],["593.2","point was they were supposed to be "],["594.31","faithful and diligent until his return "],["597.91","so that is kind of foreshadowed in those "],["600.49","different parables about this long delay "],["603.579","and as we as far as we know Paul never "],["607.72","returned to Crete we don't know if Titus "],["609.88","ever return to Crete nevertheless they "],["612.94","want the work to continue long after "],["614.829","they are gone they want other people the "],["618.37","appointed elders to step in and continue "],["621.88","the ministry the elders are going to "],["624.19","have to take over they're going to have "],["625.959","to be qualified to lead they have to be "],["628.149","able to exhort sound doctrine and refute "],["630.49","those who contradict we learned in "],["632.079","chapter 1 they have to have to refute "],["635.23","those who contradict every false "],["636.579","doctrine and do worthless deeds in "],["638.86","chapter 2 we learned about the role of "],["641.47","everyone in the church the older men and "],["644.23","the older women the younger

him he's "],["423.259","going down I'm going up right but how "],["429.08","can you be good enough when you're born "],["431.9","a sinner Nicodemus thinks that because "],["435.439","he's born a Jew

"],["463.099","because jesus said unless you are born "],["466.43","again you're not going to see the "],["467.84","kingdom of heaven and since he has no "],["469.279","clue what it means to be born again he's "],["470.99","probably not born again and if you're "],["475.939","not going to heaven that only leaves you "],["477.169","one other option do you know what that "],["478.31","is you can look at Revelation chapter 20 "],["481.279","as I read verses 11 through 15 just in "],["483.319","case you didn't know the other option "],["484.729","you don't make it to heaven verse number "],["487.19","11 of Revelation 20 says I saw a great "],["489.8","white throne in him who sat upon it from "],["491.99","whose presence earth and heaven fled "],["493.94","away and there was no place

"],["279.96","production going on around here and uh "],["282.08","you know it's more like hey guys save "],["284.08","the date and oh don't forget about this "],["286.039","commitment it's all purely optional it's "],["288.24","all just kind of FYI then there's other "],["291","times that reminding is a little more "],["294.96","confrontational because either people "],["296.96","have forgotten or they have intend "],["299.52","intentionally disregarded some "],["302.24","instructions they have through some "],["304.639","action Illustrated a level of "],["306.72","thoughtlessness or being dismissive "],["309.44","about the needs of others so reminding "],["312.6","is not shaming or scorning but it is a "],["316","level of explanation with expectation of "],["320","compliance it's explanation with "],["323.24","expectation of compliance uh all kinds "],["326.56","of examples of this you know we do this "],["329","all the time with our kids reminding "],["330.6","them of their responsibilities reminding "],["332.56","them of our expectations reminding them "],["334.8","of our family Rules and then sometimes "],["336.759","we even have to do with each other don't "],["339.08","we for example know just off the top of "],["343.36","my head something around here you know "],["344.6","we put these dishes of mints in our "],["347.72","church and uh we put these around so you "],["350.28","can freshen up your breath and uh before "],["353.52","you talk in each other's faces and "],["355.24","that's just a nice little courtesy that "],["357.4","we offer everyone you know and before we "],["359.759","can uh you know just smell good and uh "],["362.759","that that's great and and if um if you "],["365.68","have that that that's that's kind of "],["367.08","nice to find that first thing in the "],["368.36","morning who had a mint today who got "],["369.84","your mint see lots of mint people "],["372.599","okay but uh if if one person just takes "],["376.039","them by the handful right and just "],["378.24","empties The Whole Bowl in their pocket "],["381.12","well that kind of violates the principle "],["383.199","of being thoughtful of others doesn't it "],["385.039","right and and the principle of the "],["386.919","church budget right Ted you know we "],["388.24","don't want to buy Infinity of mints for "],["391","everyone here the intention is everyone "],["393.479","to get one not one person to make a meal "],["396.84","out of the mints that's the chicken "],["398.96","dinner later not the mint meal okay so "],["402.759","uh you know another example around here "],["404.44","would be you know our our our pews that "],["406.56","we have in the back there don't turn "],["408.28","around look at anybody sitting in the "],["409.199","pews pick on people for this our pews "],["411.52","with the handicap sign the reserve signs "],["413.639","posted on them they're reserve for "],["415.16","people who are limited in their ability "],["416.879","to sit in our Auditorium style seating "],["419.72","and their families to be able to sit "],["421.24","with them and uh so that's why we have "],["423.8","those there it's not reserved for people "],["425.319","who come in late or people who just want "],["427.479","to sit in the very back uh I it's uh "],["431.96","it's not a big deal it's not a big sin "],["434.36","if you satad in them but it is "],["436.44","dismissing instructions and maybe it "],["438.36","might be perap thoughtless if somebody "],["440.28","else rolls in and they don't have a "],["441.479","place to sit and we might have to remind "],["443.28","you hey guys that sign's there for "],["444.96","reason go sit someplace else my wife "],["448.4","reminds me of my mistakes all the time "],["451.639","does that annoy "],["453.12","me "],["455.8","yeah but what if she's right which she "],["458.919","always is so how should I "],["462.16","respond sub yes yes dear how may I be "],["465.24","assist be subjects hoot taso be "],["470.759","submissive is the Greek word be willing "],["473.24","to submit to orders or wishes of others "],["476.479","it's voluntary acceptance of a position "],["479.08","of "],["479.84","humility or submission Paul says remind "],["482.52","them who's them well it's the church at "],["484.8","Creed it's the Believers to be uh "],["487.44","reminding them to be willing to "],["488.879","voluntarily accept the orders and the "],["490.479","wishes of the rulers and the authorities "],["495.319","submit to the rulers and the authorities "],["497.44","this is the attitude Paul says the "],["499.8","Christian is to adopt "],["502.52","submissiveness so apparently we have "],["504.639","lots of bosses "],["507.759","rulers and "],["510.319","authorities two abstract "],["513.88","nouns that signify various forms of "],["517.08","human government Paul could have used "],["519.039","specific names or titles like Caesar or "],["521.76","king or Governor but ruler is broader "],["525.64","and takes in all of those various titles "],["528.48","and authorities are the people who "],["530.56","administrate on the behalf of the rulers "],["533.32","some people are rulers and other people "],["535.24","are authorities so here in America the "],["537.6","police are not rulers they are are "],["540.279","authorities and judges are authorities "],["542.92","and governors and senators and "],["544.64","presidents they're all "],["546.399","authorities so who's the "],["549.12","ruler it's not who but it's what it's "],["553.36","the rule of law right the rule of law no "],["557.76","one person is the ruler in this country "],["560.48","everyone and everything is supposed to "],["562.24","submit to the laws of the land and the "],["565.079","purpose of dividing the government into "],["566.839","three separate branches was intended to "],["569.48","keep one

"],["577.959","is a republic for that very reason to "],["581.04","uphold the rule of law we need to submit "],["584.079","to the authorities and sometimes we need "],["586.12","to remind the

"],["596.72","Authority a little bit in this as well "],["599.2","well nevertheless Paul is instructing "],["602.079","the church the Christians be submissive "],["605.279","be obedient and then also

to justify himself he says to "],["1435","Jesus who's my neighbor well Jesus "],["1438.44","replied by giving him a story as Jesus "],["1441.44","always did this and told great stories "],["1443","he

"],["1451.72","half dead and by chance a priest was "],["1454.2","going down on the road and when he saw "],["1456.96","him he passed by on the other side and "],["1460.679","likewise a levite also he was coming to "],["1463.08","the place and he saw him and he passed "],["1465.799","by on the other side but "],["1468.72","a Samaritan who was on his journey came "],["1471.2","to him and when he saw him he felt "],["1473.48","compassion and he came to him and "],["1475.799","bandaged up his wounds and poured oil "],["1477.559","and wine on them and put them on his own "],["1479.44","beast and brought him to an in and took "],["1481.76","care of him and the next day he took out "],["1483.88","to dinari and gave it to the inkeeper "],["1485.64","and said take care of him and whatever "],["1487.2","more you spend I will return and repay "],["1490.76","to "],["1491.6","you which of these three do you think "],["1494.96","proved to be a neighbor to the man who "],["1496.919","fell amongst the robbers "],["1498.32","hands he said well the one who showed "],["1501.679","mercy and Jesus said go and do the same "],["1506.919","so how are you to be ready for every "],["1509.64","good "],["1510.88","work right you look "],["1513.52","around see what the needs are and help "],["1516.64","out Jesus uses the story to answer the "],["1519","question who's my neighbor the lawyer "],["1520.64","knew the law of God what had commanded "],["1523","him to do but he wasn't exactly sure who "],["1525.6","he was supposed to treat with the love "],["1527.08","who exactly did God want him to treat "],["1528.64","with love now back in jesus' time the "],["1531.679","the Jews the people he was talking to "],["1533.48","they hated these Samaritans right they "],["1536.2","hated this the the Samaritan is somebody "],["1538.279","who was not a Jewish Countryman and he "],["1541.24","was looked down on and they didn't like "],["1542.96","each other at all meanwhile the people "],["1545.08","who walk by the needy man the levite and "],["1548.76","the priest would have been experts in "],["1551.48","the law would have been the people that "],["1553.48","would have known it the best taught it "],["1555.36","and you also would expect them to be the "],["1556.919","ones who would practice it right they'd "],["1559.159","be the ones that would be doing these "],["1560.64","things and yet they failed to obey the "],["1563.96","law of God they failed to do every good "],["1566.96","work but the hated Samaritan turns out "],["1569.559","to be the people who actually obeys "],["1571.52","God's laws but the point I wanted to "],["1573.48","make out of this is when he saw the man "],["1575.96","in need that's when he was willing to go "],["1579.52","and help him so how was one ready for "],["1581.88","every good deed I think it's when you "],["1583.919","see needs you step up to do your best to "],["1587.36","help right step up and help when you see "],["1589.76","people in need now uh that being said "],["1591.96","and we all how many of you commute to DC "],["1594.279","every day and and as you're as you're "],["1596.44","going by you see people on the side of "],["1598.399","the road claiming to be need don't be "],["1600.399","needy don't you and you drive by them "],["1602.159","and they got their signs they got their "],["1603.48","cups and uh if you stop to try to attend "],["1607.039","every time you saw someone who's "],["1608.48","claiming to be in need if you stop to "],["1610.64","try to help everyone like the Good "],["1612","Samaritan well you'd never get to work "],["1614.52","right and then you'd uh lose your job "],["1616.919","and then you'd be the one on the side of "],["1618.72","the road with the cop needing help right "],["1620.559","you turn into the very thing that you're "],["1622.039","trying to stop so in Jesus story we have "],["1624.76","this guy who is beat nearly to death and "],["1626.52","he's left alone and there's nobody else "],["1627.96","on the road so that's an extreme "],["1629.6","scenario what I'm saying to you is "],["1631.36","there's a certain amount of subjectivity "],["1633.919","revolving around this concept of "],["1636.52","desperate need who is in desperate need "],["1640.159","obviously one person can't do it all "],["1643.399","right so you see all kinds of needs "],["1645.08","every day you can't deal with all of "],["1647.32","them but if everyone does some good and "],["1653.2","helps in some way then lots of good can "],["1656.44","be done if everyone is doing it and "],["1659.279","working and participating then Lots will "],["1661.48","be accomplished if everyone obeys the "],["1663.36","laws then we will all be living in a law "],["1666.36","abiding land and if everyone is ready to "],["1669.039","do good then much good would be done and "],["1671.72","less wickedness would be done and we'd "],["1673.519","be living in a good community so I think "],["1677.08","you have to look at this instruction be "],["1680.24","ready to do good as a principle as a "],["1683.36","philosophy that we

"],["746.26","know I should have been able to apply "],["747.37","that principle every aspect of my life "],["749.8","and not have to be told every individual "],["751.6","but you know when you're

intentionally do what's "],["760.87","right not have to be told not have to be "],["763.51","supervised I should be able to think for "],["765.46","myself and make wise choices and once I "],["768.31","grew up I started making a point to "],["769.81","apply biblical principles every aspect "],["771.61","of my life when I got into the ministry "],["773.26","that's another whole level all right my "],["775.09","dad was a pastor once i started working "],["777.13","in churches i would call him every day "],["779.73","you know before I was being sneaky not "],["782.08","trying to tell him what I was doing then "],["783.28","I was calling him every day you know "],["785.14","what should i do in this situation "],["786.34","what's the best course of action with "],["787.99","this activity that we're facing probably "],["790.24","for ten years i quoted my dad every day "],["791.92","and everything I should do and that's "],["794.8","how you learn biblical principles that's "],["796.93","how you learn how to live them out you "],["798.58","you you you've talked to the older guys "],["800.8","the people who have done it before and "],["803.05","you pick their brain and then I knew how "],["805.15","to live life but I knew how to govern "],["806.44","the church from talking the guys that "],["807.76","have done it my dad is a pastor Pastor "],["809.53","chess Mackenzie I've told you about him "],["811","before and even today I still will ask "],["814.3","fellas for their insights I asked my "],["816.52","elders probably on a weekly "],["817.87","basis I'll send them an email I'll lay "],["819.52","out the details of a particular concern "],["821.2","and then I'll always type this in "],["823.06","conclusion and here's what's going on "],["824.32","here's the here's the concern and then "],["826.029","I'll type your thoughts ? ? ? and i'll "],["828.82","shoot it off and then that starts a "],["830.77","whole thread of discussion so I can get "],["833.14","their thoughts on it every week there's "],["834.82","something pertaining to the leadership "],["836.589","of this body of believers that i need "],["838.6","help i need godly older men to help give "],["842.23","me insights on and that's what Paul is "],["844.18","instructing here in Titus chapter 2 "],["846.04","everyone speak things fitting the sound "],["848.47","doctrine so everyone can learn and be "],["850.99","reminded of it and as you know in 2016 "],["854.47","we're going to take that command to a "],["856.36","whole new level because we want to grow "],["859.3","everyone in the area of sound doctrine "],["862.12","so we are going to be developing a Bible "],["865.27","College adult education program it's "],["868.75","going to be that type of level college "],["870.52","level education we want all of our "],["872.47","teachers we want all of our small group "],["874.42","leaders we want everyone who wants to go "],["876.88","into that class we want all of our "],["879.07","people to be thoroughly grounded in "],["880.93","sound doctrine too many Christians in "],["884.17","America can't tell the

books but are teaching "],["896.68","false doctrine and we need to know the "],["900.37","difference we need to be wise on these "],["902.29","things so Paul gets more specific about "],["905.709","the various demographics within the "],["909.4","church and what they ought to be "],["910.54","focusing on everybody needs to be "],["912.13","speaking sound doctrine but then he goes "],["914.23","through and he says older men your older "],["916.27","women younger man younger women here's "],["918.339","what you should be focusing on and that "],["920.17","kind of covers everybody doesn't an "],["921.67","older man older women younger men young "],["923.17","women either you are a man or you are a "],["925.39","woman and those are the distinctions "],["927.61","that the Bible recognizes when it comes "],["929.26","to gender and that's what we recognize "],["930.79","as well so just case you were confused "],["933.58","about that but it does point out that "],["936.4","the older have some added "],["938.88","responsibilities why do the older have "],["942.22","added responsibilities that's because "],["945.91","that's the natural order of things is it "],["948.19","not if everyone is speaking things "],["950.74","fitting the sound off "],["951.76","during every day if everyone is seeking "],["953.92","to learn and know these things then who "],["956.86","ought to be further along in their "],["958.39","knowledge and understanding the person "],["961.78","who's been doing it longer right the "],["964.66","person who's put in the time who's been "],["966.52","consistently working on it they who've "],["968.68","been intentionally trying to grow "],["970.06","spiritually it stands to reason that the "],["972.67","older they are they've gotten further "],["974.83","along in the process so the older have "],["977.65","become more mature as they've been in "],["980.62","the word the sound doctrine has produced "],["983.14","something in these older folks like what "],["985.87","well it says here the older men verse "],["988.36","number two are to be temperate dignified "],["993.13","and sensible and that's

"],["445.37","tita our big snows here in Southern "],["446.93","Maryland and there was somebody who's "],["449.09","trying to drive up to town creek drive "],["453.11","you know that little Hill up by

best ones and when we first moved "],["482.449","down here to Northern Virginia as going "],["485.12","to seminary I had two sets of tires for "],["487.4","my van and I drove for the first year on "],["490.28","the all seasons and wore them out but "],["492.349","because they didn't have any money I "],["493.789","just put the old winter tires right back "],["496.34","on her and I drove the

tick tick and people would say to "],["509.33","me yeah I got a sore all your tires "],["513.07","struggle is real "],["517.78","anyways town creek girl right gal she's "],["521.78","she's trying to

"],["540.32","coast I pull over and that's okay here's "],["543.41","what we got to do you put it in reverse "],["544.88","and straighten your tires and I'll push "],["547.16","and I'll push you off

thank you and you know what she "],["561.44","doesn't even know who I am right "],["563.17","probably wouldn't recognize me probably "],["566.57","won't even remember but i always think I "],["570.35","don't do it for money I didn't do it cuz "],["572.15","i wanted something I didn't do it I just "],["574.82","think when I see people like that boy if "],["577.4","it was my wife stuck

of them and give them "],["590.6","a hand it isn't that the point the whole "],["592.82","point of the Good Samaritan story "],["594.17","anyways right is to teach us how to love "],["597.92","your neighbor which includes right the "],["602.39","question was who's my neighbor and he "],["604.13","tells the story which says everyone's "],["607.01","your neighbor right jesus said in Luke "],["609.77","chapter 14 when you give a luncheon or a "],["612.74","dinner do not invite your friends or "],["615.29","brothers or your relatives or your rich "],["617.99","neighbors otherwise they

"],["653.779","indication that you are righteous and "],["656.329","that you will be resurrected and who's "],["659.12","going to repay you then who God there "],["665.06","you notice it easy answer guys of course "],["669.139","the lord of the course the Lord's not "],["670.699","saying never invite your friends never "],["672.56","invite your relatives over for a meal he "],["674.75","was pointing out that the true test of "],["676.85","godly self-giving hospitality is not "],["680.66","what you do for those who you like to be "],["683.209","around or who can repay you in some way "],["686.209","but hospitality is what you do for "],["689","others solely out of concern for their "],["691.37","welfare that's true godly hospitality so "],["694.459","hospitality is really important to God "],["696.699","consequently an elder a leader needs to "],["700.1","lead in the godly activity of "],["702.44","hospitality an elder does not have the "],["704.66","option to say you know I'm really kind "],["706.459","of shine it's kind of uncomfortable and "],["709.97","awkward to meet new people and you know "],["712.22","it's inconvenience to have them over "],["713.42","their

be not self-willed "],["328.51","being primed to be primarily concerned "],["331.64","about his own interest what would that "],["334.55","look like if the elder is self willed "],["337.72","well then he is doing things that "],["340.31","benefit himself right that bring glory "],["342.77","to himself he's looking out for number "],["344.93","one when David was the shepherd looking "],["347.96","after his father sheep and the bear came "],["350.81","to attack the sheep and the lion came to "],["353.03","attack the sheep if David was self "],["355.01","willed he would have said

"],["375.77","Apostles warns the church about false "],["378.32","teachers he says beware of wolves in "],["382.28","sheep's clothing wolves in sheep's "],["385.46","clothing that's a great visual

"],["417.02","devour the whole "],["418.34","flock because ultimately he sees that "],["420.139","the sheep are there to serve him self "],["422.36","will people don't serve others they "],["425.6","serve themselves they put their needs "],["429.229","ahead of everyone else now that is an "],["432.29","extreme comparison i must admit because "],["434.3","i don't think any pastor is literally "],["436.19","eating the people in the congregation so "],["439.07","let's flesh that out what does that "],["440.81","self-willed really look like in a leader "],["444.1","well a self-willed leader is that pastor "],["448.43","who thinks his way is always the right "],["451.43","way and he uses his title and position "],["454.25","to dictate his personal preferences he "],["457.729","is a buck stops here kind of leader who "],["461.21","wants to have the first and the last "],["463.07","word on everything but I'm going to let "],["466.61","you in on a little secret and probably "],["468.71","none of you have heard this from the "],["470.12","pulpit before pastors don't know "],["475.85","everything they're not the experts on "],["482.289","everything pertaining

"],["499.43","turns on but that's not the way to do it "],["501.02","right I don't know where the keys are to "],["503.419","the launch actor shed I'd I've never "],["505.43","organized or lettuce

things that happen here that I don't "],["514.88","know my point of this is that there are "],["517.43","all kinds of things being done here at "],["519.979","faith bible church i know very little "],["521.719","about and that being the case it would "],["524.209","not make sense for me to be making all "],["526.37","the decisions if i am not well informed "],["529.6","but this is the thing many times pastors "],["532.43","want to make all the decisions about "],["534.65","everything what i do know something "],["539.87","about is my people i know who can do "],["544.01","what and more importantly how they're "],["546.65","doing and i try to get the right people "],["549.29","in the right places and "],["551.75","then let them lead the dis ministries "],["553.7","and let them make the decisions and if "],["556.31","they come to me and say well pastor I "],["558.23","won't we want to do this and that and "],["559.97","the other and what do you think I'll "],["561.62","just say well what do you think you'll "],["564.35","say well I think we should do this and "],["565.64","this and this I'll be like great this "],["567.32","sounds good you know have at it god "],["570.26","bless ya some people can't do that right "],["575","it has to be their ideas and their "],["576.95","programs and their say and their way so "],["579.44","what's the problem with that well the "],["581.33","word teaches us that there are many "],["582.92","parts to the body right and everyone in "],["586.4","the body has a gift and everyone here "],["589.52","needs to be exercising that gift but if "],["591.8","400 people have to wait around for me to "],["593.84","give the orders that's a lot of "],["595.25","inactivity in the body right you know "],["597.98","some of your function some of your "],["600.17","systems they work without you thinking "],["602.21","about it aren't you glad for that you "],["603.65","maybe if you had to think the thing to "],["605.23","breathe poor Greg I mean he forget to "],["608.45","breathe and to be over and in a minute "],["611.51","you know but it works right it doesn't "],["614.75","happen you don't have to think about it "],["615.89","everything's working and I after if I "],["617.9","have to tell everybody what to do and "],["619.43","how to do it that would be a very "],["620.99","ineffective way for the body to operate "],["624.11","you know I'm an independent kind of guy "],["626.21","who likes to be creative and ask my wife "],["629.089","I don't respond well the people telling "],["631.19","me what to do some of your like that I "],["634.16","like to have space to create and freedom "],["637.07","to function and because i like that i "],["638.93","like to give that to other people as "],["641.42","well give them some space to create and "],["643.85","some freedom to function and i have "],["645.71","worked with people who are very fussy "],["647.9","and controlling and i didn't

somewheres out somewhere else "],["671.36","and they don't think about that doing it "],["674.21","their way is excluding other people and "],["676.49","then they don't show up now the other "],["679.01","thing is they're not supposed to be is "],["680.6","quick-tempered orgy lon "],["684.23","the root word or or J is anger or wrath "],["687.79","someone who is quick to wrath why would

who are quick "],["704.42","tempered typically incites two different "],["708.41","responses from other people like the "],["711.2","proverb States angry words stir up anger "],["715.01","right anger stirs up anger and if you "],["717.74","yell at people there is a certain "],["720.05","personality who's just gonna yell back "],["723.98","right who are my yell back people in "],["726.11","here

the Spirit "],["755.39","in the bond of peace right it doesn't "],["758.87","create that spirit when you're yelling "],["760.46","and grading out people it creates an "],["763.4","environment of hurt feelings and "],["764.99","negative emotions and there is also "],["766.94","another type of response to "],["768.74","quick-tempered people sometimes it "],["770.57","invokes anger and someone will fight "],["771.89","back with you but then there's another "],["773.3","whole group you hear what do you do you "],["775.73","yeah you just shut down you like whoa "],["777.35","and you just go completely into neutral "],["780.05","and you back away and you get out of "],["781.67","there and you don't like to be yelled at "],["783.71","and you don't want to be around that "],["785.33","type

"],["796.04","getting your way but eventually you're "],["797.99","going to be doing it all by yourself a "],["800.39","quick tempered person creates an "],["802.67","environment where people are

"],["624.459","who's elderly you know older due to the "],["627.94","fact that the job requires wisdom "],["629.769","expertise and experience so that one can "],["632.5","judge justly typically

"],["844.72","Holy Spirit has made you an overseer the "],["846.91","Greek word is pisgah episcopus which we "],["850.57","translate bishop and is used in the "],["852.91","other parts of the New

a son "],["230.22","of david and that's very important "],["231.84","because the Old Testament is the word of "],["233.76","God in the laws of God and the promises "],["236.16","of God and Jesus is

was Titus that was the guy "],["322.59","Titus was the guy that took on that "],["325.32","controversy quite physically next Paul "],["327.93","said Titus to Corinth and if you know "],["330.389","Corinth you know that it was a very "],["331.86","immoral city due to the fact that the "],["334.32","false religion in Corinth was very "],["336.54","hedonistic in sensual matter of

"],["430.15","on some sort of pilgrimage for they're "],["432.13","practicing their their festivals and "],["435.01","their feast which were religious and "],["436.87","they required them to go to the

fact that slavery is a common theme "],["218.819","in the Bible slavery is a powerful image "],["223.68","it illustrates to for us the reality of "],["227.579","all of humanity's condition all of "],["231.299","humanity's spiritual condition Jesus "],["233.669","says in Rome and John chapter 8 34 most "],["237.03","assuredly I say unto you whoever commits "],["239.37","a sin is a slave of sin so by listening "],["244.889","to Jesus Christ God in the flesh we hear "],["248.43","directly from God Himself who is in fact "],["251.849","a slave John chapter 8 verse 31 jesus "],["256.049","said to the Jews who believed in him if "],["258.12","you abide in my word you are my "],["260.94","disciples indeed and you will know the "],["263.099","truth and the truth will make you free

"],["275.639","said unto them most surely I say to you "],["278.669","whoever commits sin is a slave to say "],["282.6","in and a slave does not abide in the "],["285.36","house forever but a son abides forever "],["288.3","therefore if the son makes you free you "],["291.54","are free indeed so based on Jesus words "],["295.44","we see that God's view is everyone is "],["299.58","born in sin living in sin is a slave to "],["303.57","sin a slave to the law of sin and death "],["306.86","and that law was clearly stated all the "],["310.2","way back in the beginning Genesis

in pieces that Psalm "],["443.55","very poetically pretty much covers my "],["445.559","whole point here this morning it's "],["447.659","important that we recognize the "],["450.539","overarching theme of scripture on the "],["453.659","topic of slavery because once you get "],["455.939","into the nuances and these specific "],["458.129","passages which talk about slaves if you "],["460.679","lose sight of the big picture it's easy "],["463.889","to make faulty interpretations or false "],["466.74","declarations about what the Bible says "],["469.169","about slavery the

comes to set us free now the "],["483.689","question is what causes slavery or what "],["486.419","brings people into bondage well time and "],["488.399","time again is scripture like the "],["490.079","psalmist says bondage is the effects of "],["492.899","sin figuratively but even beyond the "],["496.469","metaphor quite literally sometimes it's "],["499.589","people's own sin that brings them into "],["502.499","literal bondage literal slavery an "],["505.469","example is that God used slavery as a "],["508.829","way of chastising disobedient Israel "],["512.36","lamentations chapter 1 verse 3 her "],["515.419","adversaries have become the master who's "],["518.069","her here that's Israel Israel's "],["520.409","adversaries have become the master her "],["522.599","enemies prosper the Lord has afflicted "],["525.54","her why because of the multitudes of her "],["528.209","transgressions her children have gone "],["530.31","into captivity before

other way people went into "],["547.949","slavery sinful men would "],["549.79","flict unjust slavery on someone like in "],["552.67","the case of Exodus right and the "],["555.31","children of Israel Exodus chapter 1 "],["557.47","there arose a new king in Egypt who did "],["559.15","not know Joseph and said to his people "],["561.55","look the children of Israel are more and "],["563.8","mightier

"],["572.89","and go up out of the last so what did he "],["574.9","do he enslaved the children of Israel "],["578.44","however there is a another cause for "],["582.19","slavery that is not the result of sin in "],["585.6","some cases the person willfully accepts "],["590.32","being a bond servant willfully accepts "],["593.98","being a do loss the Old Testament does "],["597.28","permit slavery or servitude but under "],["600.1","some specific circumstances with "],["602.91","restrictions the Bible says that in an "],["607.06","Israelite of the the knees réalité a "],["611.53","Hebrew father could sell his daughter as "],["614.38","a slave Exodus 21 a child of a widow "],["617.68","could be sold into slavery to pay for "],["620.59","her debt and both men and

the practices adopted "],["634.06","by the rest of the world the Bible "],["636.28","commanded that those in bondage were to "],["638.56","receive good treatment that they were "],["640.63","allowed to have wives and children and "],["642.37","they were even allowed to have their own "],["643.96","money and they were not to be it's "],["646.21","trapped in slavery indefinitely so here "],["649.36","are some of the ways that the Bible says "],["650.86","that someone could get out of slavery "],["653.61","when they they could be bought or "],["656.59","redeemed by themselves since they were "],["658.15","allowed to have money if they got enough "],["659.89","money they could buy themselves out or a "],["661.48","near relative could buy them out after "],["663.7","six years on the seventh year they were "],["667.39","let free they were you're free to go now "],["670.06","you've done six years in the seventh "],["671.5","year you go free or in a jubilee year "],["673.84","which was every 50 years on that special "],["676.96","Jubilee a year all the slaves were set "],["679.18","free doesn't matter if you had a big "],["680.89","debt on the the 49th year "],["683.41","in the 49th year I got this big dad and "],["686.35","now I got to work it off and I'm gonna "],["687.97","be a slave to Eric oh gosh and and then "],["691.569","the year 50 bang doesn't matter it's all "],["693.85","wiped out according to the law of God "],["695.41","and I would get to go free and so if "],["698.649","servants or slaves were abused by their "],["701.56","master if

"],["709.3","them then they automatically got to go "],["711.1","free Exodus chapter 21 so what we see "],["714.189","here is that there is somewhat of a "],["715.569","difference between how the Israelites "],["717.06","were in bondage to egypt vs how slaves "],["720.699","were treated in israel itself in israel "],["723.459","it's really was more of your going to "],["725.68","work for me because you owe me a debt "],["727.36","that's really what it boiled down to you "],["729.279","you're going to work on my farm you're "],["730.75","going to work in my business until the "],["733.36","debts paid off or until the seventh year "],["736.149","or until the Jubilee year and then all "],["738.129","the debts are forgiven but proverbs "],["740.019","chapter 22 verse 7 reinforces this idea "],["742.81","that debt automatically turns us into a "],["746.259","servant right what is proverbs say it "],["749.259","says the rich rule over the poor and the "],["752.88","bore is a servant to the lender so in "],["758.529","that sense I am very much a servant I'm "],["762.009","a slave to the banking industry right "],["765.279","get student loans and I
