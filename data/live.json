Kevin give "],[1569,"it up for Kevin let's get an "],[1570.4,"announcement for "],[1572.76,"you our nice Heatwave we have coming in "],[1576.52,"I'm here to introduce the 2025 softball "],[1579.6,"season our volleyball season's well "],[1581.44,"underway and I'm tired of my team being "],[1583.2,"bad and losing so I'm I'm in softball "],[1585.36,"mode now I'll blame Melody for that "],[1588.84,"um anyway so we're doing Softball we "],[1592.44,"have at least uh two teams we're looking "],[1594.36,"to put together three teams hopefully uh "],[1597,"an AB and C League um what those mean is "],[1599.92,"C league is we're here to have fun we're "],[1601.48,"not necessarily here to win we're here "],[1602.72,"to learn fellowship and have fun score "],[1605.36,"doesn't really matter I don't get it but "],[1608.44,"some people like to play that way so if "],[1610.24,"you're interested in that sign up for C "],[1611.8,"league b league is somewhere in the "],[1613.56,"middle where we want to win but we're "],[1615.52,"not professionals um so we're going to "],[1617.88,"try to make plays and we'll give you a "],[1619.08,"hard time if you miss a ball here or "],[1621.08,"there or if you strike out God forbid "],[1623.48,"that would be horrible um and then we "],[1625.28,"have an a league uh Squad as well where "],[1627.84,"we're here to win so you better not make "],[1629.36,"any mistakes or you won't hear the end "],[1630.76,"of it um so and if you're interested in "],[1634.68,"a league maybe you can help us get over "],[1636.8,"that hump we've lost in the finals I "],[1638.44,"think three years in a row now um so we "],[1641.08,"moved up from coming in third place to "],[1643.24,"second place I'm looking to move up and "],[1645.04,"actually win the whole thing for a "],[1646.36,"change um but fees "],[1648.8,"$30 um jerseys if you want one they're "],[1652,"not going to be new for any of you who "],[1653.32,"may be returning to play or if you just "],[1655.24,"want a new one um they're $25 a piece um "],[1658.84,"there's three signups out in the foyer "],[1661.44,"um so if you have any questions come "],[1663.08,"find me talk to me and the email is on "],[1666.12,"the Flyers out there so hope to see you "],[1669.24,"out there also the season runs from May "],[1672.32,"to mid-september thank you Kevin so if "],[1675.4,"we don't win this year we're just going "],[1676.6,"to put it in the budget and hire ringers "],[1680.12,"yeah sick of "],[1682.44,"this brother da let's you come help "],[1685.36,"straighten this out a little bit and "],[1687.64,"talk about listening class the listening "],[1690.76,"class so spiritual supportive listening "],[1693.48,"study starts on the 23rd of "],[1698.32,"February and it ends on the 13th of "],[1701.72,"April and it's downstairs on Sunday "],[1704.28,"morning I'll come back to that here just "],[1705.96,"a minute because you can't be down there "],[1708.44,"and up here at the same time can you "],[1710.92,"some of you probably can be two places "],[1712.56,"at once but the next uh slide uh gives a "],[1717.4,"book that we'll be using it's our "],[1721.8,"textbook care Christian caregiving the "],[1724.28,"way of life and so it has a general "],[1726.76,"overview of caregiving and then we will "],[1728.52,"go into a lot deeper than the book has "],[1730.88,"on listening skills all right that will "],[1734.48,"be available at the first class in the "],[1738.16,"23rd of "],[1739.52,"February okay I have a question for you "],[1742.88,"you all set it's on the screen have you "],[1746.56,"ever had a difficult time knowing what "],[1749.2,"to say to someone when they're going "],[1751.32,"through a difficult time how how to get "],[1753.52,"it the conversation going how to keep it "],[1756.36,"moving with that well it's very possible "],[1758.92,"that this class could help you along "],[1762.52,"that line how to ask the right questions "],[1764.6,"to keep them them moving along all right "],[1768.52,"now this class is more about that it's "],[1773.04,"learning supportive listening skills "],[1775.92,"that can deepen our understanding of any "],[1780.56,"conversation whether it is home work "],[1786.16,"church that's an idea do you think maybe "],[1788.84,"we could use this at home to listen to "],[1790.84,"each other "],[1791.92,"better maybe you're already doing "],[1795.48,"that hey teens "],[1798.36,"here's an idea you could send your "],[1800,"parents to this so that they would "],[1802.68,"listen to you "],[1804.32,"better and while you're at it you come "],[1806.84,"along to check up on "],[1808.48,"them right so teens are more than "],[1811,"welcome to be in the class together it's "],[1814.12,"interactive so I will listen to you "],[1817,"sometimes and you can share the book "],[1820.6,"with the family you could even read it "],[1821.92,"at home during the week all right just "],[1825.64,"just an idea here then throw out there "],[1829.12,"now this class is part of the "],[1833.72,"peer-to-peer listening Ministry that um "],[1837.36,"Eliana here is in charge of counseling "],[1840.04,"Ministry so if you're thinking about "],[1843.6,"getting involved on that this class is "],[1846.08,"entry level you come in here we learn "],[1848.08,"Baseline and then she teaches more "],[1850.96,"advanced subjects and it's an 8-week "],[1855.92,"study now I got to say you something you "],[1858.56,"can't be up here and down at the same "],[1860.2,"time right because it's Sunday morning "],[1861.68,"at the same time you're up here so "],[1864.24,"here's an idea many of you probably "],[1867.4,"don't know that there's a very exciting "],[1870.16,"Sunday school program downstairs at 9:00 "],[1873.76,"service all right great study great "],[1877,"teachers great course and the kids do "],[1879.48,"all kind of activities now maybe you "],[1880.96,"don't know that because your kids are "],[1882.16,"over here in children's church so an "],[1885.24,"idea that if you come early then you "],[1886.92,"could do the early service you don't "],[1888.4,"want to miss out on uh the service "],[1890.84,"worship here uh we have snack time "],[1893.52,"between the services and not just for "],[1896.08,"the kids you can have snack too and then "],[1898.88,"you could come to the listening class at "],[1901.64,"the 11:00 and the children then could be "],[1905,"in their normal children uh uh worship "],[1908.68,"service over here huh so it's it's an "],[1911.44,"idea that you wanted to do they maybe "],[1913.36,"never experienced the Sunday School down "],[1915.08,"there so give them a try for uh 8 weeks "],[1918.08,"or so all right give it a d now there's "],[1921.76,"a sign out sheet out there there's a "],[1923.68,"trifold with a little bit more detail of "],[1926.28,"what we cover in the classes and I will "],[1929.16,"be mandering around there a little bit "],[1931.24,"after the service in case you want to um "],[1934,"have a question or concern and then I I "],[1936.28,"will listen to you your concerns there's "],[1939.84,"a tri I say a trifold out there and uh I "],[1943.52,"just want to end by saying absolutely "],[1945.68,"thank you for listening for listen "],[1949.32,"thank you Mr s appreciate "],[1953.04,"that and as Don said that this uh class "],[1956.68,"is uh the training that is leading to "],[1959.36,"another Ministry the peer listening and "],[1961.24,"I see Tia's got her lanyard on want "],[1963.32,"stand and showcase that for us a little "],[1964.8,"bit just yeah there so this lanyard here "],[1967.4,"with the peer listening badge on it "],[1969.44,"there's people in wearing those around "],[1971.64,"and that one of the things that Pastor "],[1973.88,"Mark had said to the elders is like it "],[1975.68,"would be nice if we could have people "],[1978.44,"available like after the service maybe "],[1980.64,"at the front that if people need to pray "],[1982.88,"with someone they we could say hey we "],[1984.4,"got these people here to pray if you "],[1985.6,"want to come talk to somebody and pray "],[1987.12,"and someone listen to you and uh Elana's "],[1990.12,"like well that that would be great "],[1991.4,"because we could use the peer listening "],[1993.92,"Ministry the people who take the class "],[1995.92,"and do the extra training to be a part "],[1997.72,"of that Ministry so maybe that's like "],[1999.16,"hey that's not just I could listen to my "],[2001.32,"teenagers it's like this can be an "],[2003.4,"active Ministry that you can be a part "],[2005.2,"of using your gifts using your talents "],[2008.72,"and your love to help people in this "],[2010.92,"body so uh there you go jump in on the "],[2013.4,"class and uh Pastor Mark's going to be "],[2015.56,"getting the uh perer people all "],[2017.4,"organized and we'll be offering prayer "],[2019.88,"for people as they need it uh also we "],[2022.36,"have the Faith

"],[3954.68,"Babylon the Great is Fallen is fallen "],[3957.52,"and has become a Dwelling Place of "],[3959.88,"demons a prison of every foul spirit and "],[3963.36,"a cage for every unclean and hateful "],[3965.96,"bird for all the nations have drunk the "],[3969.04,"wine of the wrath of her fornication the "],[3971.08,"kings of the Earth have committed "],[3972.32,"fornication with her and the merchants "],[3974.12,"of the Earth have become rich through "],[3975.8,"the abundance of her luxury I heard "],[3978.28,"another voice from the heaven saying "],[3979.6,"come out of her my people lest you share "],[3982.04,"in her sins and lest you receive of her "],[3984.6,"plagues for for her sins have reached to "],[3986.84,"heaven and God has remembered her "],[3990.08,"iniquities render to her just as she "],[3992.6,"rendered to you and repay her double "],[3995,"according to her works in the cup which "],[3996.8,"she has mixed mixed double for her in "],[4000.36,"the measure that was glor in the measure "],[4002.48,"that she glorified herself and lived "],[4004.92,"luxuriously in the same measure give her "],[4007.2,"torment and sorrow for she says in her "],[4009.4,"heart I sit as a queen and am no Widow "],[4013.4,"and will not see sorrow therefore her "],[4016.2,"plague will come in one day death and "],[4018.2,"mourning and famine and she will be "],[4021.12,"utterly burned with fire for the for "],[4024.28,"strong is the Lord God who judged "],[4027.56,"her for the last two weeks we have been "],[4030.16,"studying about the future destruction of "],[4032.68,"something John in Revelation refers to "],[4035.72,"as Babylon through this study of the "],[4038.72,"imagery God is using and the "],[4040.44,"explanations of the symbolism found in "],[4042.64,"the other passages of scripture we have "],[4045,"learned that Babylon is really a culture "],[4047.8,"a worldview a religion that is taken "],[4050.52,"over most of humanity according to the "],[4052.88,"Book of Genesis it had its beginning "],[4055,"with a dictator named Nimrod Nimrod had "],[4058.28,"a personal philosophy that since he was "],[4061.04,"the mightiest person on Earth he could "],[4064.28,"take control he set it to prove his "],[4066.24,"Greatness by building cities and ruling "],[4068.64,"over the general population he built the "],[4070.92,"first post flood cities of the ancient "],[4073.6,"world in Mesopotamia the first one he "],[4076,"built was Babel Babylon it was H the "],[4080.76,"place where the people decided to build "],[4082.76,"a tower to heaven to make a name for "],[4085.88,"themselves now if building a mirror "],[4088.32,"Tower was such a great offense to God "],[4090.64,"pretty much every civilization would "],[4092.28,"have have incited God's Wrath there is "],[4095.08,"something more to this Tower of Babel "],[4097,"that meets the eye but not many details "],[4099.48,"are given in Genesis about what "],[4101.76,"specifically the people were attempting "],[4103.36,"to do however since since God saw this "],[4106.44,"as an act of Disobedience it's easy to "],[4109.32,"piece together their intentions Nimrod "],[4112.68,"and Humanity under his leadership was "],[4115.6,"exalting "],[4117,"themselves question what's wrong with "],[4120,"that what's wrong with self-exaltation "],[4122.64,"what's wrong with Humanity wanting to "],[4124.6,"build a great culture what's wrong with "],[4127.04,"wanting to be the best the richest and "],[4129.72,"enjoying all the things that money can "],[4131.52,"buy what's wrong with the strong ruling "],[4134.56,"the weak "],[4137.52,"these are very relevant questions for us "],[4140.04,"today as we swing hard towards being a "],[4143.08,"nation that will Implement a merit-based "],[4146.72,"system is there any problems with being "],[4150.4,"a "],[4151.32,"meritocracy the strongest the richest "],[4153.6,"the smartest will the most influential "],[4156.92,"will "],[4157.68,"rule what could be the "],[4159.76,"challenges I mean it is better than an "],[4163.56,"idiocracy where the dumb masses are "],[4166.08,"influenced by to follow stupid people "],[4168.48,"with no skills or talents just dumb "],[4170.16,"ideas that do not actually work and "],[4172.6,"result in everything burning to the "],[4173.84,"ground I mean we have literally been "],[4175.36,"living in that for the last little bit "],[4177.76,"so a meritocracy is a hard pendulum "],[4180.56,"swing away from the unscientific "],[4182.92,"foolishness that has metastasized itself "],[4184.88,"in our culture and is currently a "],[4187.44,"fullblown mental health "],[4190.24,"crisis to view it as controversial to "],[4193.28,"say there is only two genders is "],[4195.6,"evidence of the Mental Health crisis I'm "],[4197.56,"referring to to hire people to save you "],[4201.56,"from a fire who are not physically "],[4203.04,"capable of carrying you out of the fire "],[4204.76,"is evidence of the crisis to deny people "],[4207.84,"water order to save a smelt evidence of "],[4210.64,"the crisis to tear unborn children apart "],[4213.8,"piece by piece and pull them out of a "],[4215.32,"mother's womb and call it Health Care is "],[4217.68,"an Evidence of the crisis the death and "],[4220.92,"suffering caused by people believing in "],[4223.36,"lies and foolishness has been a PL PL on "],[4226.4,"This Nation the Liars have profited and "],[4229.12,"they've been given presidential pardons "],[4231.48,"before the investigations could be "],[4232.92,"started if you didn't commit any crimes "],[4235.32,"why did you need a preemptive "],[4238.08,"pardon I'm very happy change is coming "],[4240.52,"but let's not make sure we're cheering "],[4243.8,"for "],[4245.56,"Babylon so what could be the problem "],[4248.4,"with Humanity exalting itself and the "],[4251.08,"strong ruling the "],[4253.24,"weak let me give you one Bible verse "],[4256.08,"that you can use to build your as your "],[4258.72,"like purpose statement for your life uh "],[4261.96,"it put it on your vision board could be "],[4264,"your your Guiding Light a a litness test "],[4267.2,"to determine if you and the people who "],[4269.36,"are leading you are on the right "],[4272.12,"path Micah chapter 6 ver8 he shown you "],[4275.72,"old man what is good and what does the "],[4278.68,"Lord require of you but to do justly to "],[4283.6,"love Mercy and to walk humbly with your "],[4289.12,"God the problem that can arise from a "],[4292.16,"meritocracy is the worship and "],[4294.2,"exaltation of the winners the winners "],[4297.12,"want the Adoration and people love to "],[4299.04,"give it but it turns into idol worship "],[4301.56,"it always has and it always "],[4303.28,"will the best do not want to be the best "],[4306.28,"just this year they want to be the best "],[4308.72,"every year right Kevin you want to win "],[4310.24,"the softball every year and then you "],[4313.16,"want to be called the goat the the "],[4315.52,"greatest of all time and if we can be "],[4319.6,"that then we soon fancy ourselves as a "],[4325.12,"God because I'm in god mode funny how "],[4329.48,"that expression is now part of our "],[4331.28,"culture it's used so casually I'm able "],[4334.08,"to get into my windows setting and "],[4336.64,"control the program and when I'm in "],[4338.36,"control of it I'm in I'm in god mode I'm "],[4342.16,"invulnerable in this video game yeah bro "],[4344.96,"I'm in god mode "],[4347.68,"baby Nimrod was the first person to "],[4351.44,"claim god mode all the kings of the "],[4354.48,"ancient empires claimed God Mode God "],[4357.4,"mode is the philosophy of Babylon and "],[4360,"what's wrong with it is what has always "],[4361.92,"been wrong with it that too is "],[4364.64,"foolishness and lies because there is "],[4367.32,"only one Creator God and when people "],[4370.28,"exalt themselves and ignore him they lie "],[4372.96,"to themselves and everyone else around "],[4374.68,"them the the breath in your lungs is "],[4377.52,"God's the water the land and all in the "],[4381.12,"what is in the world that sustains Our "],[4382.84,"Lives was created and provided to us by "],[4387,"God we are to give thanks for these "],[4389.92,"gifts and walk humbly before God showing "],[4392.96,"Mercy to one another requiring Justice "],[4396.16,"from each other and ever seeking to "],[4398.52,"strike the balance between the two "],[4400.72,"asking God for the wisdom to help us do "],[4403.04,"justly and love mercy and that that's "],[4405.24,"how we walk humbly Babylon is described "],[4408.12,"in Revelation and all who built it and "],[4410.32,"all who support it are those who do not "],[4412.36,"believe there is a God who created them "],[4414.92,"who is Sovereign over them instead they "],[4416.96,"believe in the exaltation and the "],[4418.44,"deification of mankind and this is the "],[4420.96,"doctrine of demons this was the very "],[4423.4,"first lie spoken by the serpent to Eve "],[4426.72,"in the Garden of Eden eat of the tree of "],[4429.16,"knowledge and good and evil and you will "],[4430.8,"not die you will become like God knowing "],[4435.16,"good from evil in one sense that's "],[4439.04,"technically true God does know good from "],[4441.8,"evil but the false advertising in that "],[4444.72,"statement is eat of this and you will be "],[4448.12,"like God that's the big bold marketing "],[4452.68,"statement you know clearance 70% off big "],[4458.6,"orange yellow letters and what's down "],[4460,"here in the small print unselected items "],[4464.12,"unselected "],[4466.2,"items that means 70% off on two extra "],[4471.16,"small "],[4472.84,"shirts and three pairs of size 28 inch "],[4477.84,"waist "],[4479.48,"shorts right John Murdoch that's nothing "],[4481.84,"you're going to buy you cannot that that "],[4484.44,"is no 70% off for you "],[4486.8,"buddy eat from the tree and you will be "],[4489.92,"like God is what Eve heard what she "],[4493,"didn't hear was you will be like him in "],[4495.48,"one very technical aspect not in any way "],[4499.32,"that's going to benefit you not in any "],[4501.04,"way you assumed you'd be like God you're "],[4503.12,"not going to be all knowing you're not "],[4504.32,"going to be all powerful you're not "],[4505.56,"going to be on the present you're not "],[4506.48,"going to be immortal nevertheless the "],[4509.92,"LIE is big bold and alluring that we can "],[4514,"be like God there's a way to get into "],[4518.6,"god mode that's what Babylon is a false "],[4522.72,"religion spawn by those lies "],[4525.6,"of demons verse number two elaborates on "],[4528.72,"that for us a little bit where it says "],[4532.04,"Babylon the greatest Fallen is Fallen "],[4534.96,"it's become the dwelling place of demons "],[4537.2,"a prison for every foul Spirit a cage "],[4539.92,"for "],[4541.24,"every unclean and hateful "],[4544.92,"bird what's that all "],[4547.08,"about you know when you're uh driving "],[4549.24,"down the road you see a bunch of "],[4550.24,"vultures flocking to the side what does "],[4551.92,"that mean what's going on there somebody "],[4554.56,"hit a deer here and it's sitting there "],[4558.84,"rotting and the vultures are now "],[4562.04,"feasting on the bloated carcass there's "],[4564.92,"lots of lots of vultures and buzzards "],[4566.64,"around here you ever notice that you "],[4568.32,"know how come we how come we don't have "],[4569.72,"a uh a hunting season for "],[4571.56,"them why don't why don't we uh eat them "],[4574.68,"for Thanksgiving yeah roast "],[4578.84,"vulture "],[4582.24,"yummy kind of makes you gag right and "],[4584.6,"the reason reason is is because they're "],[4586.32,"affiliated with Decay "],[4589.92,"rot death the unclean Birds communicates "],[4594.64,"that Babylon is rotten decaying place of "],[4598.88,"death demons and death is what inhabits "],[4602.88,"Babylon so this passage supports my "],[4605.24,"belief that demons are literally "],[4607.8,"attracted to certain activities and "],[4609.76,"repelled by other activities activities "],[4612.76,"like lying hatred greed murder "],[4615,"fornication arrogance Rebellion "],[4617.2,"drunkenness drugs the Greek word phakia "],[4620.72,"where we get our English word Pharmacy "],[4623.24,"is affiliated with "],[4625.4,"witchcraft all these activities they "],[4627.72,"attract those demons Paul said in 1 "],[4630.36,"Corinthians chapter 10 rather than the "],[4633.56,"things which the Gentiles sacrifice they "],[4636.28,"sacrifice to demons and not to God I do "],[4638.92,"not want you to have fellowship with "],[4640.88,"demons you cannot drink the cup of the "],[4643,"Lord and the cup of demons you cannot "],[4644.6,"protect taken the Lord's table and the "],[4646.36,"table of demons meanwhile speaking the "],[4649.64,"truth in love and praising the name of "],[4651.44,"our great God and Savior Jesus Christ "],[4653.4,"living a life of humble obedience seems "],[4656.04,"to repel the demons Paul writes in 2 "],[4658.48,"Corinthians for though we walk in the "],[4660,"flesh we do not war according to the "],[4661.96,"flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are "],[4663.92,"not carnal But Mighty in God for pulling "],[4667.2,"down strongholds casting down arguments "],[4669.56,"in every High thing that exalts itself "],[4671.4,"against the knowledge of God bringing "],[4672.8,"every thought into captivity to the ob "],[4674.84,"Obedience of Christ how do we make the "],[4676.84,"devil flee from us James tells us in "],[4679.08,"James chapter 4 he gives Grace therefore "],[4681.88,"God resists the proud and gives grace to "],[4684.04,"the humble submit to God resist the "],[4687.24,"devil and he will flee from you draw "],[4690.6,"nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you "],[4693.64,"cleanse your hands you Sinners we put "],[4696.48,"that on the hand sanitizer there "],[4698.68,"remember that was yeah I'm cruel I know "],[4702.76,"purify your heart you double minded "],[4705.92,"this must be done "],[4707.84,"individually on the micro scale every "],[4710.84,"individual must put on the armor of God "],[4713.2,"and stand against the attacks of the "],[4714.68,"devil the Devil is a roaring lion who "],[4716.12,"walks around seeking whom he may devour "],[4718.36,"and we are in a spiritual battle every "],[4719.96,"day whether we realize it or not "],[4722.52,"Ephesians says we wrestle not against "],[4724.36,"flesh and blood but principalities "],[4726.64,"against Powers against rulers of "],[4728,"Darkness of this world spiritual "],[4729.4,"wickedness in high places we fight the "],[4732.24,"spiritual battle on the micro level "],[4733.96,"individually and when there is a group a "],[4736.96,"family a Community Church community a "],[4740.92,"nation that fights it on the macro scale "],[4744.36,"that repels the devil and his influences "],[4746.12,"away from us collectively and this is "],[4749.44,"what Israel in the Old Testament was "],[4751.68,"illustrating to us uh people obedient to "],[4755,"God who were blessed protected and "],[4757.4,"prospering because God's power and "],[4759.08,"presence was with them the demons and "],[4761.88,"their lies that lead to destruction were "],[4764.2,"unable to come near with God's presence "],[4767.24,"there but as people stopped calling on "],[4769.08,"the name of the Lord and forgot about "],[4771.16,"the laws of God their sin attracted the "],[4774.88,"demons and in Jesus day there was so "],[4778.28,"many demon-possessed "],[4780.72,"people but since uh Jesus came he have "],[4784.88,"been given the power over demons in his "],[4787.8,"name and the gospel is the power of God "],[4791.24,"unto salvation to everyone who believes "],[4794.16,"we have been given the weapons to fight "],[4796.32,"these spiritual battles but we have to "],[4799.8,"fight them for whatever reason many "],[4803.08,"people do not they have yielded as "],[4807.72,"people have given up and are no longer "],[4810.4,"resisting the temptation of sin demons "],[4813.36,"are taking over it's so widespread even "],[4816.88,"to the extent that churches and "],[4819.08,"denominations are now completely under "],[4821.16,"the sway of the Demons I mean you saw "],[4824.36,"that this week right it was on full "],[4825.84,"display for the nation and the world to "],[4827.76,"see this past week at the inaugural "],[4830,"prayer service hosted at the Washington "],[4832,"National Cathedral where Reverend "],[4833.96,"Maryanne Bud showcased the episcopalians "],[4836.96,"denomination's Disobedience to and "],[4839.2,"disregard for the word of God and Paul "],[4842.44,"warned the church Beware of the wolves "],[4845.32,"in sheep's clothing and based on their "],[4847.72,"website if you've ever gone to it "],[4850.2,"Reverend Maran and the entire "],[4851.8,"Episcopalian denomination are in facts "],[4854.2,"wol Wes in sheep's clothing they broken "],[4857.48,"rank they do not hold the line and the "],[4860.36,"demons have taken over and many churches "],[4862.76,"are promoting "],[4865.36,"Babylon the message for us today here in "],[4868.24,"Revelation chapter 18 is verse four The "],[4872,"Voice from Heaven saying come out of her "],[4875.68,"my people come out of her lest you share "],[4879.76,"in her sins and receive of her plagues "],[4885.16,"we all individually must come out of "],[4887.32,"Babylon put on the armor of God and "],[4889.72,"fight the good fight of Faith so how "],[4892.76,"does one come out of "],[4895.04,"Babylon what are the specific sins that "],[4897.76,"we need to repent of and turn away from "],[4901.6,"what is Babylon being stressed here is "],[4905.32,"their sinful is their sin look at verse "],[4908.36,"number seven because he tells "],[4910.52,"us in the measure that she glorifies "],[4914.2,"herself "],[4915.6,"and lives "],[4917.76,"luxurious in the same manner give her "],[4920.88,"torment and sorrow for she said in her "],[4923.44,"heart I sit as a queen and I am no Widow "],[4927.84,"and I will not seem "],[4929.64,"sorrow so those are the three sins "],[4932.52,"specifically that is being stressed here "],[4935.28,"what's the first "],[4936.76,"one glorifying self you know we've been "],[4939.68,"talking about this just like Nimrod the "],[4941.72,"false religion of Babylon is secular "],[4944.08,"humanism that man can obtain god mode "],[4949.2,"the second sin here is she's living "],[4952.28,"luxuriously now this Greek word here is "],[4955.36,"straso it's a there's a good old English "],[4958.08,"word we don't use it so much anymore but "],[4959.64,"there's a good old English word that "],[4960.8,"really works for this it's the word "],[4962.56,"wantan everybody remember the word "],[4964.44,"wantan wanton is doing whatever you want "],[4968.8,"unrestrained unbridled passion often "],[4971.72,"used in the context of a sexually "],[4973.68,"unrestrained woman woman which fits well "],[4975.76,"with the description of this Harlot "],[4977.48,"that's called Babylon but look at the "],[4979.96,"warnings turn to James 5 I did not put "],[4983.24,"all of the passages into slides because "],[4986.44,"this is a longer one and I got lazy but "],[4988.24,"look at James chapter 5 uh the warning "],[4990.88,"that John that that James gives to those "],[4994,"who live in pleasure and luxury James "],[4996.64,"chapter 5 starting with verse number one "],[4999.24,"James says come now you "],[5001.64,"rich weep and howl for the miseries that "],[5005.48,"are coming upon you on the rich your "],[5009.32,"riches are corrupted and your garments "],[5011.32,"are mothy and your gold and silver are "],[5013.04,"corroded and their corrosion will be a "],[5014.72,"witness against you and will eat your "],[5016.52,"flesh like fire you've heaped up up "],[5018.68,"Treasures in the last days indeed indeed "],[5021.56,"the wages of laborers mowed your fields "],[5023.8,"which you've kept back by fraud cry out "],[5025.92,"and the cries of the Reapers have "],[5027.36,"reached the ears of the Lord of hosts "],[5029.72,"you have lived on the earth in pleasure "],[5031.76,"and luxury you have fattened your heart "],[5034.52,"as in the day of Slaughter see how these "],[5038.64,"riches are a great danger to one's "],[5042,"Souls says that your clothes are "],[5044.52,"motheaten and your silver and your gold "],[5046.72,"are corroded and their corrosion is a "],[5048.96,"witness against you think about that for "],[5051.4,"a "],[5052.36,"minute when do clothes get moth eaten do "],[5057.72,"moths just fly up on you and start "],[5060.72,"noming away on your on your hoodie while "],[5063.2,"you're wearing it like is that what "],[5064.88,"happens that "],[5066.24,"how how does how do clothes get moth "],[5069.04,"eaten right when they're when they're in "],[5071.16,"storage remember back in the old days "],[5072.96,"where somebody uh would put moth balls "],[5075.68,"anybody put moth balls in their in their "],[5077.8,"okay and maybe in your coat jackets and "],[5080.2,"you put your your winter coats away in "],[5082.12,"storage and and you put mothballs in "],[5084,"your mink coat right Jennifer you put "],[5085.56,"them in your mink coat yeah keep it keep "],[5087.72,"from them moths from I know you girl I "],[5090.04,"know it's "],[5092.68,"you one of the reason reasons why gold "],[5095.36,"and silver are so valuable is because "],[5097.04,"they do not corrode but they can be "],[5099.48,"known to tarnish when stored often "],[5102.36,"storage boxes can contain organic sulfur "],[5105.32,"compounds which causes the metals to "],[5107.56,"tarnish so this storing up this "],[5110.96,"stockpiling of riches communicates "],[5114.28,"hoarding time and again we see Jesus "],[5117.52,"rebuking hoarding the wicked servant who "],[5120.88,"buried his money in the ground instead "],[5122.92,"of using it the rich man who had barns "],[5125.4,"full and he said what am I going to do I "],[5127.24,"know I'll tear my barns down and I'll "],[5128.96,"build bigger barns so I can just store "],[5131.24,"up even more I can hoard more wealth but "],[5134.28,"Jesus says lay up not up for yourselves "],[5136.24,"Treasures on Earth lay up Treasures in "],[5139.4,"Heaven you remember this story right "],[5141.84,"when when Sherry Shores saw the "],[5143.96,"earthquake that destroyed so much of "],[5145.64,"Haiti there a decade or two back and she "],[5148.72,"said to Michael I have this retirement "],[5151.12,"account that's come "],[5152.48,"due and I want to give it to this needy "],[5155.16,"church I've heard about and that gift "],[5158.24,"builts Northwest Haiti Ministries it's "],[5161.88,"now a entire church and school Ministry "],[5166.12,"that feeds hundreds of children every "],[5169.88,"day it employs people in that community "],[5173.52,"and the gifts that come out of this "],[5175.08,"church support that Ministry it's "],[5177.6,"practically Jerry you can correct me if "],[5179.04,"I'm wrong but it's practically the "],[5180.32,"economic engine of that little Community "],[5181.92,"isn't it that ministry right there is "],[5183.92,"the economic engine of that little "],[5186.6,"community in "],[5188.52,"Haiti the gifts feeding educating and "],[5194.28,"most important of all sharing the gospel "],[5197.56,"a retirement fund imagine that instead "],[5201.2,"of collecting interest to make someone "],[5203,"else richer used to build the kingdom of "],[5206.68,"God and we're looking forward to hearing "],[5208.84,"from Pastor Mark and the team as they "],[5210.6,"travel to Josiah's house in the "],[5212.2,"Dominican Republic and then Faith Build "],[5214.4,"is planning to go to Kentucky to restore "],[5216.4,"Poor People's homes this "],[5218.52,"summer all these "],[5220.52,"opportunities to get in there and help "],[5222.72,"people God doesn't mind if you have nice "],[5225.68,"things God's very generous with us but "],[5228.44,"we were blessed to be a we're blessed to "],[5232.4,"be a blessing we're not blessed to hoard "],[5234.64,"it and consume it on our own "],[5239.36,"wealth I know it's like to be "],[5242.52,"poor one of the p Falls of being poor "],[5246.36,"and then working out of it is the "],[5248.6,"tendency to cling to the money tightly I "],[5252.2,"don't want to go back to the struggle "],[5253.92,"and the more money I have that insulates "],[5256.64,"me from poverty but it's not the money "],[5259.72,"that lifted me up it's the "],[5263.24,"Lord "],[5264.88,"meritocracy makes one "],[5267.08,"conclusion I worked hard I earned this "],[5272.28,"me I pulled myself up it's my money I "],[5275.64,"can do with it what I see fits not "],[5277.72,"according to James chapter 5 where we "],[5280.72,"all have to give an account to God for "],[5282.8,"how we spend our money and how we use "],[5284.96,"our wealth and it will be counted "],[5286.84,"against you at "],[5288.64,"judgment if you only used it for your "],[5291.2,"own luxury and "],[5292.96,"self-indulgence that is the spirit of "],[5297.24,"Babylon self GL glorification "],[5301.04,"unbridled living unbridled luxuriously "],[5304.24,"and the third "],[5305.52,"one is found in these words did you "],[5309.4,"catch what it "],[5310.92,"is she says in her heart I sit as a "],[5313.56,"queen I am no Widow and I will not see "],[5316.44,"sorrow what is "],[5318.36,"that it's "],[5320.4,"Pride I'm a "],[5322.8,"queen all the kings put their Queens on "],[5325.48,"the floor we "],[5327.24,"will everybody's a queen nowadays e like "],[5329.92,"I mean that's just you slay Queen right "],[5331.6,"that's that's what's going on nowadays "],[5333.64,"everybody's a Queen this passage here is "],[5336.44,"actually a reference to Isaiah 47 turn "],[5339.52,"to Isaiah CH 47 verse number "],[5344.28,"5-9 listen to what the prophet says to "],[5349.36,"Babylon Isaiah 47 starting in verse "],[5351.96,"number five sit in silence and go into "],[5355.12,"darkness oh daughter of the calans who "],[5357.16,"are the calans "],[5359.36,"Babylonians for you will no longer be "],[5361.36,"called The Lady of Kingdoms I was angry "],[5363.56,"with my people well I have profaned my "],[5365.84,"inheritance and given them to your hand "],[5368.32,"you showed them no mercy on the elderly "],[5371.32,"you laid your yoke very "],[5373.48,"heavily and you said listen to what "],[5376.36,"Babylon said I shall be a lady forever "],[5379.2,"so that you did not take these things to "],[5381.56,"Heart nor remember the latter end of "],[5383.76,"them therefore hear this now you who are "],[5386.28,"given to Pleasures who dwell securely "],[5389,"who say in your heart listen to what "],[5390.6,"they say I am did you catch that who say "],[5394.44,"in their heart I am and there is no one "],[5396.56,"else like me I am that's the Old "],[5399,"Testament name for God they're saying "],[5402.52,"I'm God I'm in god mode and then they "],[5406.4,"say I shall not sit as a widow nor shall "],[5408.68,"I lose nor shall I know the loss of "],[5411.64,"children but these two things shall come "],[5413.84,"upon you being a widow and losing "],[5416.2,"children they shall come upon you in "],[5418.48,"their fullness because of the multitude "],[5420.16,"of your sorceries the great abundance of "],[5421.56,"your enchantments so these are defiant "],[5425.08,"Bo made here in Isaiah and then "],[5427.8,"reiterated in Revelation 18 I will never "],[5430.8,"be a widow and I will never know sorrow "],[5435.16,"I won't lose any children so when would "],[5437.56,"that "],[5438.52,"happen losing a husband losing children "],[5442.6,"well in the ancient times it was the men "],[5444.96,"the husbands the sons that went out to "],[5446.76,"war and a woman a wife who boasts I'll "],[5449.76,"never be a widow I'll never mourn the "],[5451.88,"loss of a child this means Babylon is "],[5454.28,"boasting I'm all "],[5456.16,"powerful I could never be defeated and "],[5459,"my armies and my men they're "],[5463.16,"indestructible pride comes before "],[5467,"destruction the hotti spirit before the "],[5469.2,"fall says Proverbs you know pride is "],[5472.52,"considered one of the worst "],[5474.2,"sins really worse worse than sexual "],[5478.48,"perversion worse than "],[5480.72,"murder "],[5482.64,"why because because we're all Sinners we "],[5486.44,"are all in grave danger of the wrath of "],[5489.28,"God now God is offering a way to save us "],[5493.72,"he's offering help the penalty we owe "],[5496.48,"for our sins is death which is why you "],[5499.08,"and I and everyone you know is going to "],[5500.64,"die one day we all die because of our "],[5503.2,"sin Paul says the wages of sin is death "],[5507.88,"but the gift of God is eternal life "],[5511.96,"through Jesus Christ our Lord and Christ "],[5515.44,"died for our sins and if we repent of "],[5519.28,"them if we humble ourselves and we "],[5521.88,"confess our sins he will forgive us and "],[5524.44,"he will cleanse us and we will inherit "],[5527.68,"eternal life but Pride Keeps Us trapped "],[5530.8,"in our sins and on this path to judgment "],[5534.04,"because we say I'm not a "],[5537.04,"sinner why would God punish me I'm a "],[5540,"good person and you might be very you "],[5542.52,"very well might be good at some things "],[5544.24,"you you may be you know good at school "],[5546.2,"or you work hard and you've accomplished "],[5548.28,"something you know hey I'm good at "],[5549.36,"sports and I'm good at Art and I'm good "],[5550.76,"at music and I'm good at programming and "],[5553.12,"maybe you're good at your job and maybe "],[5554.64,"you've saved some money and you're a "],[5556,"good citizen and maybe you don't break "],[5557.36,"the law and you're nice to people and "],[5559.16,"you don't let her and you you're not "],[5561.44,"rude look at all my good deeds how can "],[5564.64,"you say that I'm a sinner and I deserve "],[5567.6,"wrath well God says there's none "],[5570.56,"righteous no not one "],[5574.16,"God is the standard of righteousness not "],[5578.32,"you and if you think that you are the "],[5581,"standard of righteousness then you are "],[5583.44,"claiming god "],[5586.12,"mode do justly love "],[5588.8,"Mercy walk "],[5590.92,"humbly pride is the spirit of Babylon it "],[5594.24,"is the lies the demons tell you that "],[5596.8,"you're good man you you don't need to "],[5598.64,"change anything you don't need a savior "],[5600.92,"there's nothing wrong with you and "],[5603.2,"that's what so damning about Pride God "],[5606.16,"gives the "],[5607.8,"grace to the humble but the proud won't "],[5612.52,"ever ask for it like Babylon people "],[5615.84,"refuse to admit their "],[5618.12,"sin so the three sins here self- "],[5621.84,"glorification luxurious living and "],[5624.56,"what's the third one Pride these are the "],[5627.36,"besetting sins of "],[5629.56,"Babylon is it not fair to say they are "],[5633.24,"obser "],[5634.72,"erable prevalent characteristics of our "],[5638.92,"society "],[5641.2,"anyone if America grows more rich and "],[5645.48,"successful and powerful and will we have "],[5648.84,"the personal discipline to remain just "],[5652.44,"merciful and humble or would the "],[5655.48,"physical riches only fuel the "],[5658.08,"self-gratification the carnal hedonistic "],[5660.8,"Lifestyles and the arrogance "],[5665.6,"how are we supposed to come out of "],[5667.84,"this if we're citizens of this country "],[5672.08,"which seems so "],[5673.76,"Babylonian how do how do we he says come "],[5676.12,"out of it my people how how we don't "],[5678.24,"move to Canada telling you right now I "],[5682.16,"ain't better "],[5684.96,"there well fortunately we have an "],[5687.68,"example found in scripture from one of "],[5691,"the people most responsible for building "],[5693.36,"Babylon one he gives us the example of "],[5696.36,"how to live in it but come out of it "],[5699.04,"turn to Daniel 4 and let me review with "],[5703.68,"you the testimony of King Nebuchadnezzar "],[5708.16,"did you know that a gentile King "],[5711.68,"actually is author of some of our "],[5716.12,"Bible this chapter is written by King "],[5720.28,"Nebuchadnezzar of the evil empire of "],[5722.44,"Babylon "],[5724.64,"um for the sake of time I'm going to "],[5726.64,"summarize part of the chapter so what's "],[5729,"going on here is King Nebuchadnezzar he "],[5730.4,"has a dream and he is shown an image of "],[5732.68,"a great tree that reaches to the heavens "],[5735.96,"it fills the Earth it's full of "],[5738.96,"delicious fruits and all the animals "],[5741.44,"live under this tree and live in the "],[5744.52,"branches and it sustains everyone but "],[5748.44,"then picking it up at verse number 13 "],[5751.44,"what does it say Nebuchadnezzar I saw in "],[5754.68,"the vision in my head while I was on my "],[5756.92,"bed and a watcher a holy one comes down "],[5759.24,"from heaven and he cried aloud saying "],[5761.36,"chop down the tree cut off its branches "],[5765.52,"strip its leaves and Scatter its fruit "],[5767.84,"let the Beast get out from under it and "],[5769.36,"all the birds from its branches "],[5771,"nevertheless leave the stump and the "],[5773.32,"roots in the earth bound with a band of "],[5776.4,"iron and bronze in the tender grass of "],[5778.96,"the field let it be wet with the de of "],[5780.96,"Heaven now listen to this watch the "],[5783.2,"pronoun "],[5784.4,"and let him gaze with the beast on the "],[5788.08,"grass of the field and let his heart be "],[5790.72,"changed from that of a man and let him "],[5793.12,"be given the heart of a beast and let "],[5796.08,"seven times which would be seven years "],[5798.44,"pass over "],[5800.08,"him this decision is the decree of the "],[5802.6,"Watchers verse 17 sentenced by the holy "],[5805.4,"ones in order that the living may know "],[5808.12,"that the most high rules the kingdom of "],[5810.44,"men gives it to whom he will sets over "],[5813.16,"it the lowest of "],[5815.28,"men wow and then the Prophet Daniel "],[5818.96,"gives him the interpretation of this "],[5820.92,"dream verse number 20 Daniel says the "],[5823.92,"tree you saw which grew strong the "],[5825.92,"heights of Heaven can be seen by the "],[5827.96,"whole earth whose leaves were lovely and "],[5829.76,"the fruit abundant and there was all the "],[5832.28,"food for all and the beasts of the field "],[5834.84,"dwelt and the branches of the birds the "],[5836.24,"kingdoms of Heaven had home that's you "],[5838.8,"oh King "],[5840.4,"Nebuchadnezzar who have grown and become "],[5843.12,"strong for your greatness has grown and "],[5844.96,"reached the heavens and your Dominion to "],[5846.84,"the ends of the Earth in as much as the "],[5849.08,"king saw a watcher coming down from "],[5851.6,"heaven and saying chop the tree down and "],[5853.24,"destroy it but leave the stump and the "],[5854.68,"roots in the earth bound with a band of "],[5856.76,"iron and bronze in the tender grass of "],[5858.48,"the field let it be wet for the do of "],[5859.84,"heaven and let them gra graze with the "],[5861.8,"Beast of the field till seven times pass "],[5863.88,"over it this is the interpretation oh "],[5866.04,"King this is what's decreed by the most "],[5868.08,"high which comes upon my Lord the king "],[5871.08,"they shall drive you from men your your "],[5873.64,"dwelling shall be with the beasts of the "],[5875.04,"field and they shall make you eat grass "],[5877.44,"like oxen they shall wet with the Dew of "],[5879.88,"Heaven seven "],[5881.84,"times shall pass over you till you know "],[5886.32,"the most high rules in the Kingdom of "],[5889.28,"men and gives it to whomever he "],[5892.08,"chooses so he says uh in as much as you "],[5895.28,"they gave the command to leave the stump "],[5897.36,"and the roots your kingdom shall "],[5899.32,"assuredly be assured to you after you "],[5902.28,"know that the Heaven rules therefore oh "],[5905.28,"King let let my advice be acceptable to "],[5907.4,"you so then Daniel tells them here "],[5908.76,"here's what you should do based on this "],[5910.44,"information break off your sin by being "],[5912.44,"righteous in your iniquity by showing "],[5914.36,"Mercy to the poor so do justly love "],[5919.96,"mercy and humble perhaps there may be a "],[5923.4,"lengthening of your "],[5925.72,"prosperity and then it says here that uh "],[5929.2,"Nebuchadnezzar for 12 months think he "],[5931.08,"behaved himself it shook him up a little "],[5932.84,"bit but then look at verse number "],[5936.32,"28 at the end of the 12 months verse 29 "],[5940.32,"he was walking in his Royal Palace to "],[5942.04,"Babylon and the King spoke "],[5944.08,"saying is this not great Babylon that I "],[5948.84,"have built for a royal dwelling by my "],[5952.6,"mighty power and the honor of my majesty "],[5955.88,"and while the word was still in the "],[5957.12,"king's mouth a voice from Heaven King "],[5958.88,"Nebuchadnezzar to you it is spoken the "],[5961.48,"kingdom has departed from you and you "],[5963.88,"shall they shall drive you out from men "],[5966.36,"and your dwelling will be with the "],[5967.48,"beasts of the field and you shall make "],[5969.24,"you eat the grass like an oxen and seven "],[5972.2,"times will pass over to you until you "],[5974.52,"know that the most high rules in the "],[5977.4,"Kingdom of man and gives it to whoever "],[5979.2,"he "],[5980.92,"chooses that very hour was fulfilled "],[5983.32,"Nebuchadnezzar was driven out from men "],[5985,"and ate grass like an ox and his body "],[5987.52,"was wet with the Dew of the heavens till "],[5989.08,"his hair grew had grown like Eagle's "],[5991.2,"feathers and his nails like Bird's "],[5996.12,"Claws and at the end of the time neb I "],[5998.64,"Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to "],[6000.48,"Heaven my understanding returned to me "],[6003.28,"and I blessed the most high and praised "],[6005.84,"and honored him who lives forever for "],[6007.72,"his Dominion is an everlasting dominion "],[6010.52,"and his kingdom is from generation to "],[6012.52,"generation and all the inhabitants of "],[6014.32,"the Earth are reputed as nothing he does "],[6016.96,"according to his will in the armies of "],[6019.32,"heaven and among the inhabitants of the "],[6020.96,"earth and no one can restrain his hand "],[6023.08,"or or say what have you done at the same "],[6025.92,"time my reason returned to me and for "],[6028.16,"the glory of my kingdom my honor my "],[6030.16,"Splendor return to me my counselors and "],[6032.68,"Nobles restored me I was restored to my "],[6035.76,"kingdom with Excellence Majesty added to "],[6038.36,"me and now I "],[6040.64,"Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and "],[6043.28,"honor who the king of Heaven all of "],[6048.24,"whose works are true his ways are just "],[6051.48,"and those who walk in Pride he's able to "],[6054.4,"put "],[6056.08,"down do you understand what happened "],[6058.8,"here the king who built Babylon fully "],[6062.52,"embraced the self- glorification and the "],[6064.8,"pride that success and riches offer and "],[6068.12,"Nebuchadnezzar was in god "],[6070.56,"mode so God gave him a mental health "],[6074.04,"crisis and Nebuchadnezzar thought he was "],[6076.4,"a "],[6077.48,"cow how interesting because the same "],[6079.88,"thing happens today people think they're "],[6082.16,"cats and they think they're creep and "],[6084.52,"Men identify as women and women identify "],[6086.52,"as men just like Nebuchadnezzar the "],[6088.04,"reason has left them and that's a sign "],[6090.76,"of "],[6091.56,"judgment and all this will continue "],[6094.6,"until "],[6095.84,"when until people will "],[6098.48,"say God is in control he is the maker of "],[6102.4,"heaven and Earth his ways are just he's "],[6105.92,"all "],[6106.84,"powerful this is how we can live in "],[6110.28,"Babylon but yet come out of it so so we "],[6113.4,"don't share in her sins or receive her "],[6115.52,"plagues do "],[6117.68,"justly love "],[6119.92,"Mercy walk "],[6122.4,"humbly maybe somebody wants to start "],[6125.72,"walking humbly today let's bow in prayer "],[6128.56,"every head bowed and every eye closed "],[6130.32,"and if there's someone here today who's "],[6131.96,"never repented of their sins never "],[6135.4,"admitted I I am a sinner and I need "],[6138.52,"saving I need Jesus you just you just "],[6141.64,"pray it you just pray in your
