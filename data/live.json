"],[1788.88,"2024 who else feels like the year just "],[1792.4,"blew "],[1793.8,"by I feel like for me the week starts "],[1797.12,"and then all of a sudden Sunday's upon "],[1799.24,"me and that happens every week and then "],[1802.32,"I look up and the year's over what "],[1804.32,"happened where'd it go what did we "],[1807.4,"accomplish here at Faith Bible Church in "],[1811.32,"2024 I think we ought to take a minute "],[1813.24,"to reflect was quite a year of change "],[1815.92,"and transition here for Faith Bible uh "],[1818.32,"big thing we talked about a year ago was "],[1820.92,"the revitalization of s of Bible Church "],[1824.24,"they needed a pastor someone who could "],[1826.28,"down there and calm Troubled Water and "],[1828.32,"love people teach the word and help them "],[1830.36,"rebuild their Ministry so it was obvious "],[1833.32,"that Pastor Greg and Wendy would provide "],[1836.6,"all that so last January Greg and Wendy "],[1838.96,"left us with some Faithful Servants with "],[1841.52,"them we gave up some leaders some Sunday "],[1844.08,"school teachers children's church "],[1845.48,"workers faithful "],[1847.4,"givers and we put a lot of resources "],[1850.6,"committed to going down there we paid "],[1853.2,"Greg's salary for part of the year how "],[1855.84,"did it work out well "],[1858.64,"actually better than we expected Saints "],[1861.04,"of Bible Church is up and on their feet "],[1864,"uh by the first quarter they were "],[1866.4,"operational uh we paid Greg through the "],[1869.56,"fall and just to make sure they could "],[1871.64,"get a little buffer built up and they're "],[1874.04,"doing very well their attendance has "],[1875.8,"doubled their children's ministries are "],[1877.24,"operational we had a couple of events "],[1879.04,"during the year where we brought both "],[1880.6,"churches together and the love and the "],[1882.08,"unity was felt by all so despite sending "],[1886.6,"uh a group to say "],[1888.76,"we have been able to maintain our "],[1891.16,"attendance throughout the whole year we "],[1892.6,"averaged about 550 people every Sunday "],[1896.52,"uh uh the loss of seasoned workers did "],[1900.88,"put some strain on our Ministries uh we "],[1904.4,"gave up some Dependable people "],[1906.2,"especially we felt it in the Children's "],[1907.92,"Ministries nevertheless our Faithful "],[1910.24,"Servants committed to the vision of "],[1912.28,"teaching the children stepped up and did "],[1914.76,"the job every time we have the baby "],[1917.2,"dedication we pledge as a congregation "],[1919.76,"to assist the families in raising the "],[1922.08,"children up in the faith our Ministries "],[1925.16,"for all ages parents and children help "],[1928.16,"them learn and grow spiritually so we "],[1931,"continued that the other big thing that "],[1933.16,"happened around here was the expansion "],[1935.08,"of our physical property and having more "],[1937.16,"space immediately made our counseling "],[1939.68,"Ministry our coaching and support groups "],[1942.6,"more effective these Ministries and "],[1944.88,"programs likewise help people deepen "],[1947,"their understanding of how to personally "],[1949,"and practically glorify God in their "],[1951.32,"individual lives even now the "],[1953.36,"Philadelphia team well not literally now "],[1955,"they're getting a break right now but "],[1956.2,"John's got a team the Philadelphia Team "],[1958.4,"all of our guys working and if you "],[1960.36,"haven't been in on that get in on the "],[1961.84,"emails with Brother John Murdoch "],[1963.44,"renovating they've been working "],[1964.96,"renovating the big garage out here for "],[1967.36,"the Youth the youth are going to C4 "],[1969.28,"youth are going to have a new space to "],[1971.08,"do their Ministry and that's going to "],[1973.2,"give the aana program an opportunity to "],[1975.64,"just blow up and take over the whole "],[1977.24,"building cuz they're practically doing "],[1978.88,"that "],[1979.96,"anyways I'm personally very supportive "],[1982.48,"of all these children's ministries "],[1984.08,"because as a child I participate in all "],[1987.08,"of them and they assisted my Spiritual "],[1990.72,"Development I was involved in child "],[1993.2,"evangelism Fellowship uh Sunday school "],[1995.84,"aana that was huge in enhancing my uh "],[1999.36,"scripture memorization I learned so many "],[2001.8,"verses in aana I went to youth group and "],[2004.52,"all these programs when I was a child so "],[2006.68,"many people p poured into me this little "],[2010.32,"church The People's Church in Somerville "],[2012.56,"New Brunswick started in "],[2015.36,"1952 as I I kind of waddled in there in "],[2019.36,"1975 and that that was just a tiny "],[2022.04,"little church it's a funny thing because "],[2024.32,"I can remember uh very distinctly the "],[2027.28,"the entryway it just had one of those um "],[2031.04,"spring doors those old you remember the "],[2032.88,"barn doors with the springs on them who "],[2034.64,"who remembers those types of old doors "],[2036.32,"you just yeah you they've just snap back "],[2038.52,"real fast you know they' hit you they "],[2040.28,"get you in the door it's Canada you know "],[2041.92,"they get you it's cold and you walk in "],[2044.08,"and just be a little a little turnaround "],[2046.28,"entryway and you could either go down "],[2047.92,"the stairs or you could go up the stairs "],[2049.88,"and up the stairs was of course a "],[2051.24,"sanctuary it could seat 80 people maybe "],[2053.8,"a 100 packed in and if you went down the "],[2056.24,"stairs you were into you know the all "],[2059.76,"the old school churches were all built "],[2061.4,"this way with one open space and then "],[2063.72,"closets for Sunday School classes a and "],[2065.92,"we'd stuff the kids and we were were "],[2067.84,"just on wooden benches stuffed in there "],[2070.88,"and that's where they taught me Jesus "],[2073.56,"loves me this I know for the Bible tells "],[2076.96,"me so and during my childhood that "],[2079.24,"church grew so much that we had two "],[2082.76,"different building projects first to add "],[2085.16,"some classrooms a nursery a kitchen and "],[2087.16,"a foyer so we could get out of the cold "],[2090.08,"and that replaced the old spring door "],[2091.76,"with some nice double doors and then the "],[2093.52,"second project was they built a new "],[2095.52,"Sanctuary uh in a downstairs fell "],[2097.68,"Fellowship Hall and that new Sanctuary "],[2099.96,"could fit about 250 people and that all "],[2103,"happened just during my growing up years "],[2106,"I grew up in a vibrant Church community "],[2108.72,"the people investing in their families "],[2111.16,"the people committed to each other's "],[2114.12,"spiritual growth the church grew "],[2116.24,"numerically but they also grew "],[2118.84,"spiritually and from our youth group "],[2121.28,"which in the 80s probably had about 30 "],[2124.4,"kids four of us came out of that time "],[2127.72,"and became full-time pastors I've lost "],[2130.4,"track of all of the kids and I know some "],[2132.8,"of the some of the young ladies they "],[2134.6,"married guys who went into full-time "],[2136.64,"Ministry and there were some that went "],[2138.24,"into Christian School teachers but I "],[2140.08,"know for a fact four of us are still "],[2142.2,"pastors today and I think that's quite "],[2144.64,"substantial those people in that church "],[2147.52,"in that time they made a 15year "],[2150.36,"investment into my life and God used "],[2153.24,"them to bring me to my calling I didn't "],[2157.12,"just wait wake up and randomly decide to "],[2159.08,"be a pastor there were years of faithful "],[2162.16,"people pouring into me and all of that "],[2165.08,"was done to bring glory to God service "],[2168.12,"that people did 50 years ago and I "],[2171.2,"remember them and I emulate them all "],[2175.28,"these years "],[2176.84,"later didn't Daniel Jones do a "],[2179.64,"outstanding job last week in the Pulpit "],[2181.76,"for us he did a great job didn't he "],[2184.44,"since the flu had wiped yeah hey there "],[2186.72,"you go Daniel "],[2188.52,"happy anniversary since the flu wiped "],[2190.68,"Pastor Mark out last weekend Daniel "],[2192.72,"agreed we he Mark was like man I don't "],[2194.64,"know the flu is just wiping out my "],[2196.28,"family I'm hope I don't get it I'm "],[2198.28,"wiping everything down with sanitizer "],[2200.36,"wipes Clorox stock went up last week "],[2203.68,"because of Pastor Mark clean and "],[2205.08,"everything and uh sure enough it took "],[2207.16,"him out but we we were smart enough to "],[2210.08,"you know talk call Daniel and he agreed "],[2212.36,"to step in and so Friday he popped into "],[2214.8,"the church and I was thanking him "],[2216.84,"reflecting on his development in his "],[2219.2,"preaching how he's grown in that and he "],[2221.64,"reminded me he said well you know Pastor "],[2223.16,"I've been listening to you for 10 years "],[2224.92,"so that's kind of a quite a thing wow "],[2227.12,"it's been 10 years the fact that he and "],[2230,"other young men who've grown up here can "],[2232.84,"step into this pulpit and rightly divide "],[2236,"the word of Truth this is a testament to "],[2239.16,"all the faithful Ministry that you have "],[2241.96,"done that you have been doing glorifying "],[2245.08,"God by establishing these young men "],[2247.64,"these young believers to pursue God's "],[2249.8,"plans for their lives every Sunday our "],[2252.4,"worship team is stalked with people who "],[2257.56,"grew up here they were just little "],[2259.72,"little kids just teenagers when they "],[2261.64,"started and we got them up on stage "],[2263.48,"glorifying God and now they're so very "],[2266.08,"good at it and uh I look at all these "],[2269,"young adults and I see that the future "],[2271.88,"of Faith Bible Church is in very good "],[2274.68,"hands all of our Ministries all of them "],[2277.04,"are full of people who were once "],[2278.92,"children who are being served and now "],[2281.32,"they're serving the Next Generation all "],[2283.16,"of our Nursery all of our Sunday school "],[2285.64,"up there in our audio visual you know "],[2288.12,"Justin Shaner used to just be a little "],[2289.76,"guy running around here and then I go up "],[2291.36,"there this morning and I'm like hello Mr "],[2292.8,"Shaner and he's up there serving the "],[2294.88,"lord "],[2296.44,"Faithfully the years just keep rolling "],[2299.4,"by don't they you just look at your kids "],[2301.8,"and you go man this just where' the time "],[2303.56,"go here's Noah and now he's 6' one I "],[2305.76,"don't know when did that happen that I "],[2309.36,"was really driven home to me in Tony's "],[2311.36,"uh wedding this past year but I'm "],[2314.08,"confident that if for whatever reason if "],[2316.36,"the Lord moved me along this next "],[2318.36,"Generation would step up and continue to "],[2322.24,"glorify God by sharing the good news of "],[2324.8,"Christ establishing Believers to pursue "],[2327.64,"God's plans I said at our annual meeting "],[2330.48,"none of us will ever know how many lives "],[2333.24,"are being changed by these Ministries "],[2335.84,"we're never going to hear all of the "],[2338.12,"testimonies so much is being done "],[2340.28,"privately especially in our counseling "],[2341.88,"Ministries we provide respectful "],[2345.92,"confidentiality but you're all doing it "],[2349.24,"based on faith you won't know till you "],[2351.28,"get to heaven what we've truly been able "],[2353.84,"to accomplish and all of our Ministries "],[2356.96,"from the kiddos all the way up to our "],[2358.88,"missions overseas helping in ways that "],[2361.16,"are impa impacting people for future "],[2363.4,"Generations impacting our culture "],[2365.8,"building the kingdom of God one life one "],[2369.28,"Soul at a time and your faith is making "],[2372.52,"all this possible you know what God will "],[2375.84,"reward you for these things all these "],[2378.44,"things you did not even know you were a "],[2379.88,"part of one day we're going to be a part "],[2382.4,"of this heavenly scene Turn to "],[2384.48,"Revelation chapter 15 as we see this "],[2387.28,"heavenly scene and we get back into our "],[2389.52,"study in the Book of Revelation and if "],[2391,"you're new this morning or your first "],[2392.44,"time here I apologize you just landed in "],[2396.84,"uh fullblown study of the Book of "],[2399.76,"Revelation chapter "],[2401.88,"15 pouring out bold judgments on youall "],[2406.16,"morning see I wanted to start real "],[2408.24,"positive because we're goingon to get "],[2410.04,"into some challenging stuff here in just "],[2413.04,"a minute well one day we will be part of "],[2415.92,"this scene this amazing scene Revelation "],[2418.6,"chapter 15 where we have the this whole "],[2423.12,"congregation in heaven verse number two "],[2426.52,"and the joh joh writes that I saw "],[2429,"something like a sea of glass mingled "],[2431.32,"with fire and those who have the victory "],[2433.48,"over the Beast and over his image and "],[2434.96,"over his Mark and over the na number of "],[2436.8,"his name standing on the sea of glass "],[2439.16,"having harps of God singing the songs of "],[2441.6,"Moses the servant of God and the songs "],[2444.08,"of the Lamb what are they singing great "],[2446.12,"and marvelous are your Works Lord God "],[2447.92,"Almighty just and true are your ways oh "],[2450.56,"King of the Saints who shall not fear "],[2453.12,"you oh Lord and glorify your name for "],[2455.96,"you alone Are Holy and all the nations "],[2458.08,"will come and worship before you for "],[2460.08,"your judgments have been "],[2464.84,"manifest Christmas Eve uh was always so "],[2469.48,"much fun to have everyone together in "],[2471.8,"one service you know we're always split "],[2473.24,"up between the two services but just "],[2474.88,"putting everyone together in one service "],[2477.08,"we had over 450 people here on Christmas "],[2480.04,"Eve a packed house glorifying God and "],[2484.88,"that's as close as we get to this ly "],[2487.6,"seen here when you have everyone and we "],[2491.88,"should aspire to that every week here at "],[2494.44,"Faith Bible Church every week a packed "],[2497.08,"house all services until everyone "],[2499.88,"understands the good news until everyone "],[2502.24,"in our community is pursuing God's "],[2504.6,"purposes for their lives one day "],[2507,"glorifying God forever in heaven that "],[2509.52,"will be our Eternal reward and as the "],[2512.76,"years fly by I realize that day is "],[2516,"coming closer and closer that we could "],[2519.56,"be there together in "],[2520.92,"heaven but now John turns our attention "],[2524.84,"away from that glorious scene in heaven "],[2527.04,"and we resume observing what is "],[2529.48,"unfolding on the earth During the sevene "],[2532.8,"period known as the Great Tribulation "],[2536.12,"this chart summarizes all that we have "],[2538.2,"seen the end of the church age the "],[2540.92,"opening of The Seven sealed scroll "],[2543.28,"beginning the time the scroll which we "],[2545.84,"learned is the title de of the earth who "],[2548.92,"is worthy to take the scroll and open "],[2551.68,"the seals it was announced from the "],[2553.68,"throne and the answer was the lion of "],[2556.48,"Judah the lamb who was slain for the "],[2558.64,"sins of the world he is the only one "],[2561.08,"born of woman who could take the scroll "],[2563.88,"and reclaim the Earth from the evil "],[2566.72,"Empires Satan had spawned and in this is "],[2570.56,"the time when Satan and all who reject "],[2574.04,"Jesus lordship will be evicted from the "],[2577.24,"the Earth this will also be the time "],[2579.68,"when the eyes of so many people will be "],[2582.88,"opened up to the truth and they will "],[2584.92,"turn to Jesus repenting of their sins "],[2587.8,"and will be saved as much as I can sing "],[2590.8,"the Praises of my little church in new "],[2593.08,"Bruns where I grew up for the number of "],[2595.12,"us who went into the ministry I can also "],[2597.2,"rattle off the names of many of my peers "],[2599.8,"who walked away from church and do not "],[2601.92,"believe in Jesus to this day and the "],[2603.84,"same is true here I can look around and "],[2606.36,"see all of these young men and women who "],[2608.36,"grew up here and are now serving but I "],[2610.32,"can also tell you a list of those who "],[2612.96,"refus to come and glorify God so we "],[2616.2,"continue to pray for them they do not "],[2618.32,"lack the "],[2619.4,"information they just find it "],[2622.12,"distasteful at this time they deem "],[2624.84,"scripture "],[2626.4,"unbelievable but that will change when "],[2629,"they see the sealed judgments the "],[2631.88,"trumpet judgments happening before their "],[2634.56,"very eyes and that is precisely the "],[2638.08,"reason why I need to preach through this "],[2641.4,"book people need to have heard all about "],[2645.16,"this so that when the Great Tribulation "],[2647.52,"begins they will understand what's "],[2650.12,"happening all of these seven 14 21 "],[2655.56,"judgments have been foretold in our holy "],[2660.24,"scriptures our ministry will have "],[2663.44,"planted the seeds of the Gospel into the "],[2666.6,"hearts of the children so when that "],[2669.12,"Great Tribulation begins when the "],[2671.16,"prophets and the witnesses and the "],[2673.36,"angels during the seven years preach the "],[2676.08,"gospel to the whole world those seeds of "],[2678.6,"faith will spring up to a harvest of "],[2681.36,"Souls and there will be a great "],[2684.68,"Revival but there will also be a "],[2688.64,"holocaust of those who do trust in Jesus "],[2691.24,"in that time but that need not concern "],[2693.88,"us because as the Apostle Paul put it "],[2696.56,"for me to live is Christ and to die is "],[2701.6,"gain dying will seem like a mercy "],[2704.92,"compared to what is going to happen to "],[2706.44,"those who dwell on the earth during this "],[2709.36,"time Revelation chap 15 verse number "],[2712.96,"five after these things I looked and "],[2715.2,"behold the Temple of the Tabernacle the "],[2716.96,"testimony in heaven was opened and out "],[2719.12,"of the temple came the seven angels "],[2720.84,"having the seven plagues clothed in pure "],[2723.84,"bright linen having their chest girded "],[2726.28,"with gold "],[2727.56,"Bands then one of the four living "],[2729.6,"creatures gave to the seven angels seven "],[2733.6,"golden bowls full of the wrath of God "],[2736.4,"who lives forever and ever the temple "],[2738.64,"was filled with the smoke from the glory "],[2740.08,"of God and from his power no one was "],[2741.8,"able to enter the temple till the seven "],[2744.88,"plagues of the Seven Angels were "],[2747.64,"completed then I heard a loud voice "],[2749.72,"chapter 16 from the temple saying to the "],[2751.72,"seven angels go pour out the bowls of "],[2754.68,"the wrath of God on the Earth "],[2757.96,"so the first went and poured out his "],[2759.92,"bowl upon the earth a foul and loome "],[2763.28,"swar came upon the men who had the mark "],[2765.64,"of the beast and those who worshiped His "],[2768.6,"Image then the second Angel poured out "],[2771.16,"his bowl on the sea and it became blood "],[2774.36,"as of dead men and every living creature "],[2776.76,"in the sea died then the third Angel "],[2779.28,"poured out his bowl on the rivers and "],[2780.8,"the spring waters and they became blood "],[2782.92,"and I heard the angel of the waters "],[2784.64,"saying you are righteous oh Lord the one "],[2787.56,"who is and who was and who will be "],[2790.36,"because you have judged these things for "],[2792.88,"they have shed the blood of the Saints "],[2795,"and the prophets and you have given them "],[2797.28,"blood to drink for it is their just due "],[2801.4,"and I heard another from the altar "],[2802.92,"saying even so Lord God Almighty true "],[2805.96,"and righteous are your judgments then "],[2808.24,"the fourth Angel poured out his Bull on "],[2809.96,"the Sun the power was given to him to "],[2812.44,"Scorch men with fire and men were "],[2814.72,"scorched with a great Heat "],[2817.56,"and they blasphemed the name of God who "],[2820.72,"has power over these plagues and they "],[2823.04,"did not repent and give him "],[2826.48,"glory so here we see the final judgments "],[2830.12,"the wrath of "],[2832.12,"God so the feedback I was getting was "],[2835.56,"everyone enjoyed the Breather from this "],[2839.64,"and our Christmas Series where we showed "],[2841.72,"you all the gifts that God has been "],[2843.84,"giving us and you remember all the gifts "],[2846.32,"so just tell me no right one of the "],[2848.72,"gifts was peace remember that one and we "],[2850.76,"talked about the fact that God is so "],[2853.44,"powerful that he could destroy us but "],[2856.28,"instead he wants to be at peace with us "],[2859.16,"and he's offering this gift of peace and "],[2861.76,"we are to jump at the offer this is not "],[2864.96,"a gift that we should send back some of "],[2868.12,"you open gifts on Christmas and you "],[2870.4,"thought ah I need to I need to send this "],[2873.76,"one back it's not the right size it's "],[2877,"what happens when you order from Teemu "],[2878.88,"you just get the wrong "],[2881.4,"size says this isn't worked the way I "],[2883.84,"thought you know it doesn't quite work I "],[2885.6,"got to send this "],[2887.2,"back the gift of peace with God through "],[2890.84,"Jesus the Messiah is not a gift that you "],[2893.92,"should return and here's why right here "],[2896.68,"look at what happens to the people who "],[2898.24,"reject God's "],[2899.64,"peace that he offers them the first bowl "],[2903.64,"is a foul and loome sword "],[2907.28,"two Greek words both of them are "],[2910.04,"communicating evil you got kacos and you "],[2913.12,"got poros used together they stress the "],[2917.56,"soar is being festering inflamed "],[2924.16,"oozing "],[2926.64,"infected now it's interesting here what "],[2928.76,"did it say the sore was connected to did "],[2931.52,"you see that "],[2934.12,"detail a foul and lome sore Came Upon "],[2937.24,"the men who had the mark of the "],[2941.08,"beast it's connected to those who have "],[2943.64,"the mark of the beast almost as if the "],[2945.08,"mark itself is causing this infection "],[2948,"maybe this whatever it is that they put "],[2949.88,"in them this Mark is now uh their bodies "],[2953.32,"are having adverse reaction to it that "],[2955.32,"might be reading a little bit into it uh "],[2957.2,"we do know that uh source is a common "],[2960.44,"plague that has been used in scripture "],[2961.92,"in the past when was that Egypt Exodus "],[2965.56,"right Exodus chapter 9 the Lord said to "],[2967.8,"Moses and Aaron take a handful of Ashes "],[2969.64,"from the furnace and let Moses scatter "],[2971.68,"to the heavens in the sight of pharaoh "],[2973.64,"and it will become Dust In the Land of "],[2975.16,"Egypt and it will cause boils to break "],[2977.52,"out on men and beasts all throughout the "],[2979.64,"land of Egypt so he took the ashes and "],[2981.36,"the furnace and he stood before pharaoh "],[2983.04,"and he threw it into the heavens and it "],[2985.04,"caused boils to break out Soares on men "],[2987.84,"and beasts and The Magicians could not "],[2990.08,"stand before Moses because of the boils "],[2992.32,"for the boils were on The Magicians they "],[2994.24,"were mimicking and they could do all the "],[2996.12,"things and they couldn't even stand they "],[2997.36,"were full of boils in these oozing "],[2999.96,"festering sores all the plagues of Egypt "],[3003.28,"were to prove to pharaoh and to the "],[3005,"Egyptians who really was God Jesus "],[3008.88,"always healed the lepers remember the "],[3011.48,"lepy was that um those sores that were "],[3014,"infected and they were just basically "],[3015.44,"your decaying your body parts were "],[3017.4,"rotting off and Jesus would heal all "],[3020.36,"these lepers proving his divinity God "],[3023.96,"can heal to prove his power and God can "],[3027.64,"take away Health to prove his authority "],[3030.64,"myself I prefer the healing isn't that "],[3032.88,"much better yes good good to get the "],[3035.24,"lesson there the next two bowls they "],[3037.84,"likewise sound like plagues of Egypt "],[3039.6,"don't they the second bowl poured out on "],[3041.52,"the sea and it became as blood of a dead "],[3043.96,"man and every creature in the sea "],[3047.2,"died it's all blood I wonder what that "],[3050.96,"smelt like you know it's nice to go to "],[3053.36,"the water he go to the the the coast "],[3055.68,"going to the OBX "],[3057.16,"but you ever walk down along the beach "],[3059.52,"and uh you get downwind of a dead fish "],[3062.56,"right you're walking along so "],[3065.2,"nice trying to figure out where it is "],[3067.44,"and get it around it one time we were in "],[3069.36,"Delaware was Bethany Beach and um a big "],[3073.32,"old sea turtle was dead and it washed up "],[3076.4,"on the beach and the whole place was "],[3079.96,"just wreaking and they had to get a "],[3082.44,"bobcat down there to pick that thing up "],[3084.64,"it was so big and dig it out of there "],[3086.88,"and um you know everybody like all the "],[3090,"all the people that live on the beach "],[3091.24,"and all the shop owners were like get "],[3093.44,"that dead turtle out of here it's "],[3095.84,"stinking everything up because it's "],[3097.44,"driving people away everybody just runs "],[3099.28,"away from that space imagine all the sea "],[3102.88,"life dead and washing up on every "],[3106.2,"Shoreline that's what's going to happen "],[3108.72,"here third Bowl same thing only this "],[3113,"time it's the what the rivers and the "],[3115.92,"springwalk and it becomes like "],[3118.52,"blood what happens when all the water is "],[3121.28,"taken away now you got to remember to to "],[3124.2,"build on the "],[3125.64,"previous "],[3127.24,"uh the previous bowls right because the "],[3130.2,"first Bowl was "],[3131.68,"the sores right so everyone has these "],[3135.08,"oozing festering sores and nothing can "],[3138.8,"be washed because all the water's gone "],[3142,"so everyone's dirty and smelly and "],[3144.76,"covered in infection and nothing can be "],[3146.96,"cleaned and then what else when you "],[3148.68,"don't have any "],[3149.84,"water kind of need that to live e you "],[3152.12,"got you need water to drink and they can "],[3155.44,"only have blood to drink and the reasons "],[3157.92,"given what was the reason given in verse "],[3161,"six for they shed the blood of the "],[3163.48,"Saints and the prophets and you've given "],[3165.68,"them blood to drink for it is their just "],[3169.56,"due we we sometimes use that expression "],[3172.96,"bloodthirsty to describe someone who is "],[3175.44,"vicious and murderous "],[3177.08,"like you know a blood thirsty pirate or "],[3180.68,"meaning they enjoy murder and it excites "],[3183,"them instead of pity or remorse for "],[3185.36,"taking the life they have the opposite "],[3187.28,"emotion and this is not a good emotion "],[3190.36,"to Foster and cultivate nevertheless it "],[3192.32,"is always been a part of the sinful "],[3194.84,"human nature to love violence and to be "],[3197.92,"excited by brutality the entertainment "],[3201.24,"in the ancient Coliseum in Rome looks a "],[3204.76,"lot like our modern day "],[3207.44,"movies and video games now we give "],[3209.8,"ourselves a pass and we'll say well Rome "],[3211.92,"they're far worse because they were "],[3213.32,"literally feeding people to live animals "],[3216.48,"they were literally watching Gladiators "],[3218.96,"fight to the death for fun ours is just "],[3221.32,"acting you know it's just fake it's make "],[3223.84,"believe true but we do feed this Blood "],[3227.28,"lust even in the pretending so when the "],[3230.8,"Antichrist brings the executions during "],[3233.96,"the tribulation and they're executing "],[3235.72,"the prophets and the Saints people are "],[3238.28,"conditioned to accept it they take "],[3240.76,"pleasure in killing the saints of God "],[3243.72,"which is why God is giving them only "],[3246.2,"blood to drink to match their "],[3249.08,"bloodthirsty passions that does not "],[3251.52,"sound sound very thirst quencing does it "],[3254.44,"just to have blood as opposed to what "],[3257.96,"Jesus promises to give us for our thirst "],[3260.92,"John 4 verse number 13 Jesus answered "],[3265,"and said to her whoever "],[3267,"drinks this water will thirst again but "],[3269.8,"whoever drinks the water that I give "],[3271.68,"them will never thirst but the water "],[3274,"that I give will become in him a "],[3276.44,"fountain of water springing up to "],[3279.44,"everlasting life that's what he offers "],[3282.12,"you this morning for your thirsty Soul "],[3284.32,"Revelation 21 verse number six and he "],[3287.04,"said to me it is done I am the alpha the "],[3290.16,"Omega the beginning and the end and I "],[3292.16,"will give of the Fountain of the Water "],[3294.76,"of Life freely "],[3296.84,"to all who "],[3298.72,"thirst rejecting God's peace has serious "],[3302.52,"consequences doesn't it nothing to drink "],[3306.56,"fourth "],[3308,"bow we now compound that with the sun "],[3311.6,"heating up scorching men with fire "],[3315.08,"scorching with great heat "],[3318.52,"so when you're got a burn what do you "],[3322.04,"need all my nurses how do you how do you "],[3324.4,"treat a "],[3325.32,"burn cold water right you got to get "],[3327.52,"cold water on well there's no water "],[3329.76,"there's just stinking blood that's all "],[3331.4,"you "],[3332.16,"have but notice the reaction of the "],[3334.44,"people I think this is very telling I "],[3336.6,"want you to not miss this so men were "],[3339.88,"scorched verse nine with a great heat "],[3342.44,"and they what does it say blaspheme the "],[3346.08,"name of God who has power over these "],[3348.08,"plagues they did not repent and give him "],[3354.36,"glory our Christmas Eve service is so "],[3357.96,"much more than a nice Christmas "],[3361.56,"tradition it is the children of God's "],[3365.48,"time to come and "],[3369.4,"glorify there really is no other "],[3371.72,"activity that's more important than "],[3373.68,"glorifying God so I started in chapter "],[3376.52,"15 because I wanted to contrast What's "],[3378.72,"Happening Here chapter 15 verse number "],[3381.08,"four here's the Saints in heaven around "],[3383.64,"the Throne of God and what are they "],[3385.36,"saying verse number four chapter 154 who "],[3388.04,"shall not fear oh Lord and "],[3391.4,"what glorify your name who will not fear "],[3395.04,"and glorify your name and the answer to "],[3397.04,"that question chapter 16 verse number "],[3399.68,"eight they pour out the Sun the power to "],[3402.28,"Scorch men verse n they Scorch them with "],[3404.24,"heat they what blasphemed God's name and "],[3407.88,"they did not repent and they did not "],[3409.52,"give "],[3410.36,"him "],[3412.68,"glory I love how the hym writer States "],[3416.64,"the desire oh for a thousand tongues to "],[3420.64,"sing I need a thousand tongues my great "],[3424.48,"redeemer's praise the glories of my God "],[3426.28,"and King the triumphs of his grace he's "],[3429.04,"expressing I need more tongues to "],[3431,"Proclaim all the praise due to God "],[3433.96,"second verse my gracious master and my "],[3435.92,"God assist me he's praying assist me God "],[3438.92,"assist me to Proclaim to spread to all "],[3441.12,"the Earth abroad the honors of your name "],[3443.48,"everyone's got to hear this message "],[3444.84,"everyone needs to hear the the name of "],[3446.68,"Jesus Jesus the name that charms our "],[3449.16,"fears that brings our sorrow cease it is "],[3451.56,"music in the sinner's ears it is life "],[3453.72,"and health and peace Jesus why what did "],[3456.44,"he do fourth verse he breaks the power "],[3459.2,"of canel sin he sets the prisoner free "],[3462.64,"his blood can make the foulest clean his "],[3465.4,"blood avails for me this is the good "],[3468.2,"news I got to sing it I got to shouted "],[3470.92,"oh for a thousand tongues to "],[3474.08,"sing meanwhile "],[3476.76,"these people here have one tongue and "],[3479.92,"they'd sooner nod off than glorify God "],[3483.76,"instead of repenting they blaspheme and "],[3487.52,"that is why this is all got to be drawn "],[3490.2,"to a close God's final judgment has to "],[3493.48,"come these people are unredeemable they "],[3497.48,"know what's going on they know that this "],[3499.8,"is God's Wrath being poured out on them "],[3501.88,"and they know why because of their evil "],[3503.44,"deeds and they will not "],[3508.32,"repent there are people here today who "],[3511.24,"do not repent because they're "],[3513.2,"unconvinced they're not sure there is a "],[3515.8,"God they're not sure if there's a heaven "],[3518.28,"or a hell they're not sure if they're "],[3520.4,"really that bad what do I what do I need "],[3521.92,"to repent of there's a lot of uninformed "],[3526.12,"and Confused people and God wants us to "],[3529.6,"share with them serve them in kindness "],[3533.48,"communicate the message of the Salvation "],[3536.12,"and the hope of eternal life the hope of "],[3539.4,"eternal life because we all know we're "],[3541.36,"going to die one day we're all going to "],[3543.92,"die but there is a hope of glory and God "],[3547.08,"is not willing that any should perish "],[3548.92,"but that all come to "],[3552.68,"repentance so often what happens is "],[3556.44,"people hear the gospel and since they're "],[3557.92,"doubtful they just remain skeptically "],[3561.68,"unbelieving I don't know but then this "],[3565.28,"is always the case "],[3567.16,"here comes some pain suffering the chaos "],[3571.92,"it's out there happens to us all it "],[3576,"humbles us it reveals to us our "],[3578.24,"deficiencies our weaknesses and in that "],[3580.96,"Dark Night of the Soul that's usually "],[3583.8,"when we cry out to help we cry out for "],[3586.56,"the help and Jesus "],[3587.92,"answers he saves us that's the "],[3591.44,"reoccurring theme of the entire nation "],[3593.28,"of Israel all throughout the Old "],[3594.88,"Testament you get into into sin they get "],[3596.72,"into a mess they cry out for help God "],[3599.64,"restores them and that's the message of "],[3602.08,"Jesus come unto me all you who are weary "],[3604.84,"and burden down and I will I'll give you "],[3608.32,"rest Jesus is the Fortress the place of "],[3611.48,"protection he's called The Rock Jesus "],[3614.72,"says the wise man builds his house on "],[3617.16,"the rock and when the storms of life "],[3619.76,"come his house his life will not "],[3622.6,"collapse meanwhile the foolish man "],[3624.28,"builds his house on the so when the "],[3626.68,"storms of life hit "],[3628.84,"you their life "],[3630.8,"collapses the storms will come so all "],[3635.12,"the old people will give me an Amen on "],[3636.72,"that right the chaos is coming the pain "],[3640,"The Dark Night of the Soul comes for us "],[3642.16,"all and in that moment the best thing "],[3644.04,"you can do is just cry out to Jesus for "],[3646.24,"help but when the fifth bowl is poured "],[3648.72,"out in its complete darkness all these "],[3650.88,"people do is wallow in their pain and "],[3653.28,"they blaspheme that is a Greek word it "],[3655.76,"is a transliteration blaso it means to "],[3659.4,"revile to speak evil of to "],[3664.04,"curse and they show no glory to God they "],[3668.08,"only curse him so this is why I would "],[3670.8,"conclude that these people are "],[3671.8,"unredeemable because the only way to be "],[3673.6,"saved is to repent and cry out to God "],[3676.96,"for help and they do just the "],[3680.76,"opposite when I was in a dark and scary "],[3683.88,"place when everything in my life was was "],[3686.04,"going to be destroyed I cried out to God "],[3688.92,"I knew to cry out to God because I was "],[3690.92,"taught the words I was taught the verses "],[3693.28,"I was taught the theology it was in my "],[3695.28,"head and it got down to my heart real "],[3697.08,"fast got down to my heart it got out my "],[3699.44,"mouth and I repented and I recited Jesus "],[3703.12,"saved me as I learned so long ago Jesus "],[3707.32,"loves me as I know the good news is "],[3710.92,"God's word declares whosoever calls upon "],[3713.92,"the name of the Lord shall shall be "],[3716.28,"saved so these people here in Revelation "],[3718.32,"16 they could be saved but they won't be "],[3720.32,"saved because they won't call on the "],[3722.08,"name of Jesus to save them they'll only "],[3726.28,"blaspheme "],[3728.04,"2024 had some great times and it had "],[3730.2,"some hard times like every year there's "],[3732.64,"joy and there's pain I didn't always "],[3735.24,"communicate very well on a few occasions "],[3737,"my tongue got me into trouble I'm sure "],[3739.52,"you know who I got in trouble with with "],[3740.92,"my "],[3741.68,"Tong for the most part I had many "],[3744.92,"opportunities to glorify by God and I "],[3748.24,"took them when the pain came I prayed "],[3752.44,"and God helped "],[3754.2,"me none of us nobody in here is going to "],[3757.52,"be perfect in "],[3759,"2025 you shocked to hear that none of us "],[3762.72,"we will sin offend worry curse we will "],[3767.72,"struggle and we will "],[3769.92,"fall but you can always choose to come "],[3772.12,"back and worship you can always come "],[3774.4,"here every Sunday and glorify "],[3777.2,"a new year approaches and I wonder what "],[3780.04,"will you do when the pain the darkness "],[3783.4,"comes will you curse God for it gnaw "],[3786.4,"your tongue in pain or will you use your "],[3788.68,"tongue to recite the promises that can "],[3791.08,"bring you the healing you need the "],[3792.96,"Living Water to quench your thirst the "],[3795.04,"cleansing that you need from "],[3796.36,"unrighteousness 2025 will give plenty of "],[3799.04,"opportunities to glorify God or "],[3801,"blaspheme God it will be my goal it'll "],[3805,"be Pastor Mark goal the spiritual "],[3807.2,"leaders the staff of Faith Bible Church "],[3809.44,"our goal will be to provide you and your "],[3811.36,"family a place to come and glorify God "],[3814.08,"every week it will be our

Savior Jesus "],[3829.12,"Christ Lord we pray that that will "],[3831.6,"happen here in 2025 that we will all use "],[3835.92,"our tongues to glorify you to praise you "],[3839.48,"to give you all the glory and honor and "],[3842.28,"worship that you so deserve one day we "],[3844.88,"will be part of that scene in heaven and "],[3846.84,"we do look forward to that day even as "],[3848.8,"we think of loved ones who are already "],[3850.24,"there doing that and we long to be with "],[3852.32,"them Lord we pray that we will be "],[3854.04,"faithful and we'll be devoted and we'll "],[3855.6,"be
