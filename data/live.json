on"],["2389.92","Sunday evenings for a big church family"],["2392.599","game of soccer and we would go and play"],["2396.72","and Tony's big cousins would always be"],["2398.48","playing and I think that's when he"],["2399.72","decided that you know he was going to be"],["2401.599","into soccer and so every year he played"],["2404.319","Parks and Rec Soccer and many of those"],["2406.839","years I coached him in those uh in those"],["2409.96","years um a few years uh Garrett Joy was"],["2413.119","actually on the team and then so I had"],["2414.8","Garrett and Tony and then Bobby helped"],["2416.839","me out and we were coaching together and"],["2418.92","then uh when we went to Kings Christian"],["2421.04","academy uh Bobby and I ran the whole"],["2423.2","soccer program

life"],["2442.24","just all that stuff and and then uh Tony"],["2444.839","and Garrett they got into high school"],["2446.56","and and then Bobby came over and helped"],["2448.359","me with the coach the high school boys"],["2449.96","and we had some really good teams had a"],["2451.56","really good run through those years uh"],["2454","also we were doing indoor soccer during"],["2456.48","the winter we we'd stack a team of Kings"],["2458.92","Christian Academy kids and we put them"],["2461.119","in uh the league in Leonardtown and so"],["2463.72","that was our way of kind of just giving"],["2464.96","them more playing time and in"],["2468.119","2018 was Tony's senior year we finished"],["2471.2","the fall season with the winning record"],["2473.04","and then we did uh indoor soccer uh over"],["2476.319","in Leonardtown and on this particular"],["2478.4","season there was a team that was all"],["2480.88","chopped toon High School soccer players"],["2483.24","on this one team so their coach was"],["2485.2","doing the exact same thing I was doing"],["2487.319","stacking a team and putting his guys"],["2489.16","into the league in Leonardtown so we had"],["2491.72","Kings Christian Academy Boys versus"],["2494.2","chopticon boys and those games were"],["2497.16","awesome and some of the boys are uh from"],["2499.48","church they knew each other and they"],["2500.88","wanted to they really wanted to beat"],["2502.68","each other and they were pretty even but"],["2505.64","first time we played chopticon guys got"],["2507.48","us and they won but the last game of the"],["2510.599","indoor season once again it was us"],["2513.839","versus the chopticon boys and everyone"],["2516.68","was everyone was pumped I mean these"],["2519.56","guys
