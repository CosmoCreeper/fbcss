return what knowledge do I want you to have what's the last thing I want to"],["260.32","tell you in case I don't make it back the Apostle Paul the Apostle Peter is"],["266.88","having the same thoughts in this letter second Peter look look at verse 12 he"],["273.44","says \"For this reason I will not neglect to remind you always of these things"],["279.759","though you know and are established in this present truth yes I think it is right as long as I am in this tent to"],["287.199","stir up in you by reminding you knowing that surely I must put off my tent just"],["292.4","as

he"],["368.08","says for if these things are yours and abound you will neither be barren nor unfruitful in the what knowledge of our"],["375.12","Lord Jesus Christ and then all of verse 10 brethren be

with the church the people of faith so they would know how to carry on without him he's going to"],["405.6","give them the most important knowledge that he has do you think that would be significant the last words of Peter"],["412.72","i mean who we talking about peter who's Peter it's like the unspoken"],["418.72","leaders of the disciple of the Jesus right and he says he's a verse one Peter"],["424.56","is an apostle which is a rare thing in order to be qualified as apostle you had"],["430.56","to be directly taught by Christ himself and been given the apostolic gifts by the Holy Spirit given the mandate by"],["438.8","Jesus himself now people nowadays will give themselves that title but that is a misappropriation they are not true"],["445.84","biblical apostles it's it's sort of like how people nowadays call each other king and queen you know you go queen right"],["453.599","you could call yourself that but you have no lands no people that recognize"],["459.599","you as such you have no real authority to declare yourself royalty jesus chose"],["466.16","the apostles there's no line of succession for the title to be passed to anyone else but Peter was an apostle his"],["474.08","doctrine came from the son of God his special revelation is from the Holy Spirit so do you think his knowledge"],["481.52","would be something of high value and importance there are lots of things that we can spend our time studying and"],["487.52","learning there's a steady stream of information available to us do we know"],["492.639","which we should prioritize what's worth our wild How about the knowledge concerning the"],["499.039","divine power that gives us everything pertaining to life and godliness how"],["504.8","about the concepts that make us partakers of the divine nature how about the formula the plan that if it is"],["512.64","followed provides you an entrance into everlasting kingdom"],["518.159","at the same time this knowledge will insulate you against artificial fake"],["524.88","false intelligence and that's never been more relevant as it is right now is it"],["530.48","you cannot trust what you see with your own eyes and what you hear with your own ears an uncanny tool for deception has"],["538.24","been invented an AI can show you and tell you anything"],["543.839","and most will be unable to discern fact from fiction and Peter understands all this and he's offering the most"],["550.399","essential knowledge that one could ever possess knowledge of our God and Savior"],["556.16","Jesus Christ last week"],["561.6","200 Christians were massacred in Nigeria by Islamic extremists last Friday their"],["569.519","houses while they were sleeping at night their houses were set on fire and as they rushed out to escape the fire they"],["575.519","were hacked to death with machetes there has been 10,000 Christians killed"],["582.56","in Nigeria over the last 3 years now for those people this knowledge is worth"],["589.6","losing their lives over they'd sooner die than deny their faith in Jesus so"],["595.68","they have been murdered and Peter he feels the same way that's how important"],["601.2","this knowledge is to Peter yet many people place so little value on this"],["606.24","information many people it it it just feels like a chore to come to church and"],["611.68","another boring sermon by Pastor Rob no fun learning about God or it's too"],["618.72","overwhelming like Tony having to hear all the instructions about the last will and testament could you just not die but that's the point isn't it could you just"],["625.6","not die that's not an option peter's about to die the people he's writing to"],["631.12","were like the brothers and sisters in Christ that we have in Nigeria they were under intense persecution both from the"],["636.959","Sanhedrin the ruling class of leaders in Jerusalem and from the Roman Empire"],["642.64","being a part of the first century church was probably the most dangerous thing you could do back in 66 AD when this"],["649.36","book was written but truth be told all life was fragile back then rome was"],["654.72","conquering the world so people were always in danger of being invaded and killed but so too were the Roman"],["660.88","soldiers who were always being commanded into battles that they could die in the Roman Empire was full of slaves and"],["667.76","slaves lives were cheap and expendable but the rulers themselves they always had a bullseye on their back julius Caesar he conquered the whole world he"],["674.24","was stabbed to death by his most trusted people a2 brute"],["680.079","show hands who here's not going to die okay which is why Peter's information is"],["686.48","so vital all flesh withers and fades away and"],["691.68","death comes to all people but Peter has the knowledge of the divine power that"],["696.959","supplies us an entrance into the heavenly kingdom and Peter saw it with his own eyes he saw Jesus on the mount"],["703.76","of transfiguration when his deity shone and his veil glory was revealed for that"],["708.8","moment and Peter heard God say \"This is my son listen to him.\" And Peter saw"],["714.64","that divine power for three years as he healed the sick and Jesus raised the dead and he he beheld Jesus the"],["721.44","resurrected savior himself he understood Jesus is God and the knowledge he wants"],["728.32","us to be reminded of is how to live life in such a way that we are prepared for"],["733.68","eternity this is a reoccurring theme in all of scripture that the life we live in this realm affects the life we live"],["740.24","in the next the life we live in this realm affects the life we live in the next so if you listen carefully he's"],["747.12","going to tell us what we ought to be doing now that's preparing us for the everlasting kingdom and it starts with"],["753.68","the first title that Peter uses for himself what did he title himself apostle what's the first title"],["760.399","bondervant in the ancient world a bondervant was someone who was a willing slave someone"],["767.519","who had been redeemed they are legally set free but they choose out of love and loyalty to their master to stay with him"],["775.12","and the Mosaic law gave a uh a whole prescription of this exodus 21 if the"],["780.32","servant says \"I love my master and my wife and children and I do not want to go free,\" then his master will take him"],["786.16","to the judges and they'll take him to the door and they'll pierce his ear with an all"],["791.76","and he will be a servant for life now we just spent five weeks learning about the"],["797.839","kinsman redeemer Jesus who paid our debt and brings us into the family giving us"],["803.36","an eternal inheritance we are the chosen people of God by faith followers of Jesus peter the apostle that sounds so"],["809.92","prestigious but in Peter's mind bond servant comes first"],["814.959","servant is what Jesus emphasized the son of man came not to be served but to"],["821.76","serve and that's who Peter's aspiring to be like and that's who we should all aspire to be like our servant king"],["829.2","here's the knowledge that Peter wants to remind us of verse two grace and peace"],["835.76","be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord as his divine"],["841.04","power has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by glory"],["846.959","and virtue by which have been given to us exceedingly great precious promises"],["852.88","that through these you are partakers of the divine nature escaping the corruption that is in this world through"],["859.36","lust there's a lot packed

it"],["1383.76","looked like trash right you know because No because you know like there's some three-year-old he's and you and they"],["1390","stick it up there and you'd be like \"Oh that's

lines so I never got the blue ribbon somebody else would always be up there"],["1410.08","at the top first place blue ribbon and I was down here with you know some herper that couldn't color within the lines"],["1417.6","and that was my first memory of having my skills judged you know if you"],["1424.96","couldn't color in the lines your coloring is not good and you know there's an object objective"],["1432.159","good that we always are trying to achieve i taught the boys when they cut grass yeah we're going to cut the grass and they're like you know let's get this"],["1439.28","done

They seem like lovely people. Sunny to the left of us, Melvin"],["113.759","over here on this side of the street, and Big Ed lived behind us.

That's a reality.

But he gives us examples. He gives us evidence"],["386.08","to back up his assertions. So I said, if you want to know the details, you got to"],["391.12","come back. And apparently you did. So you're interested to find out these examples. So chapter 2, verse number"],["397.68","four. Here's go Peter's examples to back up the threat of destruction."],["404.24","He says,\"For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to"],["409.84","hell and delivered them into the chains of darkness to be reserved for judgment,"],["414.88","and he did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in"],["421.68","the flood on the world of the ungodly, and turning the cities of Sodom and"],["427.599","Gomorrah, into ashes, condemning them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterwards would live ungodly"],["436.16","and delivered righteous Lot who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of their wicked of the wicked. For that righteous"],["442.16","man dwelling among them tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds. Then"],["450.479","the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to reserve the"],["456.319","unjust under punishment for the day of judgment. and especially those who walk according"],["462.96","to the flesh in the lust of uncleanliness and despise authorities."],["468.4","So Peter gives us a history lesson to back up his claims that God will bring"],["474.16","judgment. Three examples, the angels who sinned, the ancient world destroyed by"],["479.28","the flood, and Sodom and Gomorrah. Three of the biggest examples from Genesis,"],["485.68","the three that shocked and amazed people for generations. Also, the three events recorded in the"],["493.12","Bible that many people have a hard time accepting as true. They seem so extreme"],["499.84","and so wild. That's like nothing we've ever witnessed. And you want to know why that is?"],["507.199","Because these judgments were so effective, you only had to see it once."],["513.599","Thereafter, the threat, the warning of judgment was more than enough to keep"],["519.12","the most of humanity away from completely going evil."],["525.2","When I was in school, there were teachers who we'd act up in their"],["530.8","classes all day long because they never did anything to stop us. One math"],["536.8","teacher we had, he was always drunk or dealing with a hangover. And he did not"],["543.76","care what we did. He, it seemed like there was no line. He had no line for us"],["549.12","to cross. And we spent the entire year trying to see if we could find a line."],["555.36","And the whole time we were in his class, we were testing to see what can we get"],["560.64","away with. you know, it's a third story window, so we would just throw paper and"],["565.839","textbooks and whatever junk out the window just to see if we catch his attention. And uh we would just mess up"],["574.08","our desk and mess up our chairs and just break the things. And one guy took out a"],["579.36","knife and he cut all of the drapes into little strips. And another fella pulled out a lighter and he lit his desk on"],["586.88","fire. and and it was a game we played to see if"],["593.36","we'd even get his attention. And rarely he'd barely look up at us."],["601.12","Meanwhile, we had other teachers we didn't utter a peep in their classes."],["606.959","Mrs. Bryant was an old lady with a bamboo stick."],["612.64","She never smiled and she was always on the edge of snapping. And if she heard a"],["618.079","noise, she'd turn around and bang, she'd hit the desk right in front of you and scare the devil right out of you."],["625.36","Teachers were permitted to strap us on the hand or have us stand up and give us some swats on the hind end. And there"],["634.24","were teachers who were notorious for strapping, but Mrs. Bryant was in a league of her own. She was just looking"],["640.64","for an excuse to beat a child's butt. So, you never heard anyone"],["647.6","speak, chew a gum, pass a note, drop a pencil,"],["657.2","look sideways. Nobody ever acted up in Mrs. Bryan's class. In math class, we lit desk on"],["664.399","fire. Same kids, different results."],["670.079","Because we'd seen the punishment Mrs. Bryant would deliver, everyone knew,"],["675.12","don't test her, you'll suffer. My point is the things that we study today, God's"],["681.12","punishment was so severe after it happened, most people got the message. God made his point. Most people"],["687.839","recognize the wrath of God is a real thing. We better keep ourselves and we better keep our communities in check or"],["694.32","else. So yes, we have never seen God's"],["699.839","severe wrath like these three examples because things haven't gotten that bad"],["707.519","yet. First time God's wrath was severe. We see in verse number four, Peter says,"],["713.68","\"The angels themselves who sinned, cast down to hell, delivered"],["719.519","into the chains of darkness to be reserved for judgment.\" Wow. What do they do? Well, Peter"],["725.6","doesn't elaborate on that. The fact that he doesn't elaborate seems to indicate that his audience already knows what"],["731.12","he's talking about, so he doesn't go into details. Jude likewise references this event with the angels in much the"],["738.24","same way. Jude, like Peter, was warning the church about ungodly people pretending to be of the faith, but"],["745.12","they're not believers and they have evil intentions. Turn over a couple pages uh"],["750.48","to your this way towards Revelation. Uh it's like two books over Jude uh chapter"],["756.16","1 because there's only one chapter. Verse number four, and we read, \"Certain men have crept in"],["763.6","unnoticed who long ago were marked out for this condemnation. ungodly men who"],["768.959","turn the grace of our God into lwdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord"],["775.519","Jesus Christ. But I'm rem want want to remind you though you once knew this"],["781.92","that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed those who did not believe and"],["788.88","the angels who did not keep their proper domain but left their own abode. He has reserved in everlasting chains under"],["795.44","darkness for the judgment of the great day as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities"],["801.36","around them in the similar manner to these having given themselves over to"],["806.959","sexual immorality and have gone after strange flesh are set forth as example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."],["816.56","So, just like Peter, Jude uses two of the same examples of God's judgment to"],["822.48","warn the church, to warn us of what happens when people fall away from the"],["827.519","faith. These angels, Peter says, who did not keep their proper domain but left"],["832.88","their abode are now in chains, held captive"],["838.24","because whatever they did, and Peter or Jude don't tell us specifically what sin"],["844.32","the angels did other than Jude says, \"Well, they didn't keep their proper domain.\" So Jude's audience, like"],["849.6","Peter's audience, seems to know what these authors are referring to. Apparently, everybody knew what those"],["855.68","angels did. Do you know? Do you know what those angels did? Turn to Genesis"],["862.88","6. Let's go right back to the source material, the very beginning. Genesis"],["868.399","6:es [Music] 1-"],["874.88","8. Let me pick it up here."],["880.72","It came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, the"],["885.76","daughters were born to them. The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were beautiful, and they took wise for"],["892.56","themselves of all whom they chose. And the spir the Lord said, \"My spirit will not strive with man forever, for he is"],["898.72","indeed flesh, yet his day shall be 120 years.\" There were giants on the earth in those days and also after when the"],["906","sons of God came into the daughters of men and they bore children to them. They"],["911.44","were the mighty men who were old of old men of renown. The Lord saw the"],["916.56","wickedness of man was great on the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And"],["923.76","the Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth and he was grieved in his heart. So the Lord said, \"I will destroy"],["930.16","man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing, birds of the air. I am sorry that"],["937.36","I made them.\" But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. So taking that at"],["945.199","face value, it means angels somehow had sexual relations with human women and spawned a hybrid offspring. This is what"],["953.04","Jude means when he says the angels did not keep their proper domain. The"],["958.24","offspring of these angels and human women was a race of mighty men called"],["963.519","the Nephilim or called the giants and these giants were very evil and"],["971.36","corrupted the entire world and all of humanity became very evil. In the"],["977.04","there's an ancient book that was written in around 300 BC called the book of Enoch and it gives much greater detail"],["984.399","about these angels and all that they did. So the book of Enoch tells us the oral traditions that the Israelites"],["991.36","learned and passed down about these fallen angels. So according to the book of Enoch, 200 angels conspired to come"],["998.16","down to earth, live with humans, marry the women, and teach forbidden knowledge. Their offspring, the"],["1004","Nephilim, were also called giants, were powerful and violent, and their appetites were insatiable. They killed"],["1010.32","and they plundered to such an extent that most of humanity was corrupted by their bloodline. So the book of Enoch is"],["1017.839","not included in the Jewish scriptures. It is not part of the Old Testament. So we don't view its details as the"],["1024.64","inspired word of God. But what the book of Enoch does, it provides us the"],["1029.919","understanding of what Peter and Jude's audiences learned or understood the"],["1035.52","interpretations of Genesis 6 to be. The book of Enoch fills in elaborate narrative. But Genesis 6 alone gives us"],["1042.959","the facts. Gives us alone the facts that the angels left their domain, cohabitated with the humans, and their"],["1048.4","offspring corrupted the world. Peter and Jude revealed to us that the angels who"],["1053.84","did this were severely punished, locked away in an abyss, held in chains of"],["1060","darkness till the great judgment. Oh, that's just crazy. I've never heard such"],["1065.52","a thing. That's got to be a myth. That is true. We don't see angels mating with humans anymore."],["1072.4","I wonder why. Could it be that the rest of the angels saw how severe God's wrath was and"],["1079.2","concluded, \"Oh, that ain't worth it. Let's remain in our proper domain and"],["1084.72","not try to procreate with humans. It's only going to get us destroyed.\" Because"],["1089.919","after all, that is Peter's point. That's the point he's trying to make. And the destruction was not just on the angels."],["1096.64","In the same chapter of Genesis chapter 6 can he connects the story of the angels"],["1102","spawning the Nephilim hybrid race to the flood of Noah which is Peter's second"],["1108.32","example in Peter 2 verse number five. He said"],["1114.72","and did not spare the ancient world but saved Noah one of eight people a preacher of righteousness bringing in"],["1120.559","the flood on the world of the ungodly."],["1125.76","So wicked, so corrupt was the entire population of the earth that only Noah was determined to be righteous. Genesis"],["1133.12","6 verse 5-8. The Lord saw the wickedness of man was great. The intent of the"],["1139.2","thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. The Lord was sorry that he made man on the earth. It grieved his"],["1145.679","heart. So the Lord said, \"I'm going to destroy man whom I've created from the face of"],["1150.88","the earth, man and beast, creeping things, birds of the air. I'm sorry. I made them. But Noah found grace in the"],["1158.48","eyes of the Lord. Since everyone was evil, God sent the flood to destroy all life with the"],["1165.2","exception of Noah and his eight family members and the animals that got on the"],["1170.72","ark. And Peter's point is these false teachers,"],["1176","their disobedience and uncleanliness is only going to result in destruction. So"],["1181.2","keep the false teachers out of the church. And then he gives one last example of destruction. Peter quotes and"],["1188.16","so does Jude. Sodom and Gomorrah. These cities were in the time of Abraham. And"],["1195.44","like the pre flood civilization, these cities were totally corrupted. Turn to"],["1201.84","Genesis chapter 19. Let's read the story of Sodom and Gomorrah."],["1210.799","All right. Chapter 19. In Genesis, now the two angels came to Sodom in the"],["1217.12","evening. Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose up, met them, bowed himself with his face"],["1223.28","towards the ground, and he said, \"Here now, my lords, please turn into your servants's house and spend the night,"],["1229.2","wash your feet, and then you can rise up early and go on your way.\" And they"],["1234.64","said, \"Nah, we'll spend the night in the open square.\""],["1239.76","But Lot insisted strongly. So they turned into him and entered his house."],["1246","Then he made them a feast and baked unleaven bread and they ate. Now before they laid down the men of the"],["1253.28","city, the men of Sodom, old and young, all the people from every quarter"],["1258.559","surrounded the house, and they called to Lot and said, \"Where's the men who came to you tonight? bring them out to us so"],["1266","we can know them carnally. Lot went out to them through the"],["1271.2","doorway, shut the door behind, and he said, \"Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly. See now I have two daughters"],["1278.72","who have not known men. Please let them bring let let me bring them out to you,"],["1284.08","and you may do with them as you wish. Only do nothing to these men, since this"],["1289.36","is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.\" And they said, \"Stand back.\" Then they said, \"This one,"],["1296","he came to stay here, and he keeps acting as a judge. Now we will deal"],["1301.28","worse with you than with them.\" So they pressed hard against the man Lot. They came near to break down the door. But"],["1307.84","the men, the angels, reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. And then they"],["1313.6","struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that it became weary,"],["1320.24","trying to find the door. So the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah is that"],["1325.6","they were so sexually deviant that the entire city would wanted to pray on"],["1332.08","helpless travelers. Two male travelers weren't safe in that city after"],["1338","nightfall. Lot the nephew of Abraham is the only righteous person in the city."],["1344.4","And he tried to protect these angels who are disguised as guys traveling. He"],["1349.6","insisted that they stay in his house for the night. And all the men in the evening showed up at Lost Door,"],["1356.72","demanding the travelers be brought out so they could violate them. The men wanted to violate these other men. But"],["1364.64","the angels blinded the people of the city and then they compelled Lot and his family to leave because God is going to"],["1371.44","destroy this wicked culture. And God does. He rains down fire and brimstone and destroys everyone in those cities."],["1379.76","So Sodom is comparable to the days of Noah where the entire city is given over"],["1386.72","to perversion and violence. Not the whole world at that time just for"],["1391.919","whatever reason these two cities was a concentration of immorality. So there's"],["1397.2","your three examples in the background, the history, three testimonies of God's judgment and destruction that comes when"],["1404.32","people give themselves over to filthy conduct and lawless deeds. And while yes, it is true that all people are"],["1412.559","sinners and there has been many horrible examples of cruelty and injustice and"],["1419.44","godless behavior in every and all culture the world over. Nevertheless, it"],["1425.52","has never gotten to the extent of what humanity was like before the flood or"],["1430.72","how deviant the entire population of Sodom and Gomorrah was. As perverted as"],["1436.559","America is in 2025, we're not as perverted as they were in Sodom and Gomorrah. So, yay."],["1445.919","So, we've never seen this in our time. this level of judgment. Those events"],["1451.12","happened long ago and far away. And some people speculate, well, since we don't"],["1456.32","see that level of judgment and wrath from God, probably that's not true. That's just all made up. You know,"],["1461.6","that's that's just a scare tactic. That doesn't happen in"],["1466.88","real life. And why do you suppose that is?"],["1472.159","Because as bad as things get, there is still some element, some"],["1478.96","percentage of the population that will exercise some level of restraint. There"],["1484.32","is a percentage of the population that does fear God, that can spot the"],["1489.679","patterns, can connect the dots and see that wickedness leads to destruction, godless living leads to death,"],["1496.159","immorality leads to poverty and shame and ruin. Meanwhile, there is another way to live that leads to blessings and"],["1503.279","peace. And since there is enough percentage of the population that will strive to live good, even though we're"],["1509.36","not perfect, but we are humble and repentant and faithful of enough that it"],["1515.919","promotes God to be patient. And I'm not just making that up, just pulling that"],["1522.159","out of my hat. This is literally what God said to Abraham before the angels"],["1527.84","went down to destroy Sodom. Abraham advocates for mercy for those cities. Go"],["1533.84","to Genesis chapter 18. Let me read to you this interesting discussion God has"],["1540.159","with Abraham. This is Genesis 18 picking it up at"],["1545.2","verse 20. And the Lord said,"],["1550.72","\"Because of the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grave, I will go down now and"],["1558.48","see whether they have done alltogether according to the outcry against it that"],["1563.919","has come up to me, and it and if not, I will know.\" So the men turned away from"],["1570.08","there and went towards Sodom. So that's the two angels. Okay? But Abraham stood before the Lord."],["1576.64","Abraham came near and said, \"Would you also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Suppose suppose there's"],["1584.64","50 righteous within the city. Would you destroy the place and not spare it for the 50 righteous that are in it?\" Far be"],["1591.6","it from you to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the"],["1597.039","wicked. Far be it from you. You shall not the judge of all the earth do right?"],["1603.52","And the Lord said, \"If I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city, I will"],["1611.52","spare all the place for their sakes.\" Abraham answered and said, \"Indeed now,"],["1619.039","I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord."],["1624.96","Suppose there were five less than 50 righteous. Would you destroy the city for a lack of five?\" So he said, \"If"],["1632.08","there are 45, I will not destroy it.\" And he spoke to him again and said, \"Suppose there's 40 found there.\" And he"],["1640.159","said, \"I won't destroy it for the sake of 40.\" And then he said, \"Let not the Lord be angry and I will speak. Suppose"],["1646.4","30 should be found there.\" He said, \"I won't destroy it if I find 30 there.\" And he said, \"Indeed now, man, this guy,"],["1651.52","he should be in contracts, right? Like this guy can negotiate.\" Abraham says, verse 31, \"Indeed now, I've taken it"],["1658.4","upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose 20 be found there. And he said, I won't destroy for the sake of 20. And"],["1664.159","he said, let not the Lord be angry. I'll speak one more time. Just one more time. Suppose 10 be found. And he said, I will"],["1670.4","not destroy it for the sake of 10. So the Lord went his way as soon as he"],["1676.559","was finished speaking with Abraham. Abraham returned to his place."],["1682.64","Very insightful interaction. Through it, we learn there is a level of"],["1687.84","abomination that God will not tolerate. However, if there is a percentage of the population that's righteous, a very"],["1695.12","small fraction, for their sake, he would withhold judgments."],["1701.52","And then we remember the words of the Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter 5."],["1707.919","He tells his followers, \"You are the salt of the earth.\" But if the salt"],["1714.159","loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned?

And for the"],["1808.24","longest times, those three examples, Sodom and Gomorrah, the flood, the angels were very effective warnings. But"],["1815.679","now we see people who scoff at those examples. They don't believe in fallen"],["1820.88","angels. They don't believe in the abyss. They don't believe in a global flood that happened. They don't believe Sodom"],["1826.159","was a real place or God would ever be so vengeful and bring destruction on people. Look at look at Peter's"],["1832.399","description of folks. Verse number 10, chapter 2, 10. Actually, pick it up in"],["1838.64","verse 9. Then the Lord knows how to deliver godly out of temptation and reserve the unjust under punishment for"],["1844.32","the day of judgment and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanliness and despise"],["1851.36","authority. Peter says, \"God will deliver the godly"],["1856.799","out of temptation, reserve the unjust for punishment, especially those who walk according to the flesh, and then"],["1863.52","the lust of uncleanliness.\" So, let's break that phrase down. That's a very important, especially those, right?"],["1869.679","Those who walk. Walk is the biblical language that means doesn't literally mean walk.

And yet, this is what is promoted in many churches in"],["2005.12","Western Europe and North America. Like I said last week, the false teachers have"],["2010.159","taken over many of the pulpits, denominations, and seminaries. And we see it all around us. And then we look"],["2017.12","at Hollywood.
