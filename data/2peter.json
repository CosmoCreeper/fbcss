return what knowledge do I want you to have what's the last thing I want to"],["260.32","tell you in case I don't make it back the Apostle Paul the Apostle Peter is"],["266.88","having the same thoughts in this letter second Peter look look at verse 12 he"],["273.44","says \"For this reason I will not neglect to remind you always of these things"],["279.759","though you know and are established in this present truth yes I think it is right as long as I am in this tent to"],["287.199","stir up in you by reminding you knowing that surely I must put off my tent just"],["292.4","as

he"],["368.08","says for if these things are yours and abound you will neither be barren nor unfruitful in the what knowledge of our"],["375.12","Lord Jesus Christ and then all of verse 10 brethren be

with the church the people of faith so they would know how to carry on without him he's going to"],["405.6","give them the most important knowledge that he has do you think that would be significant the last words of Peter"],["412.72","i mean who we talking about peter who's Peter it's like the unspoken"],["418.72","leaders of the disciple of the Jesus right and he says he's a verse one Peter"],["424.56","is an apostle which is a rare thing in order to be qualified as apostle you had"],["430.56","to be directly taught by Christ himself and been given the apostolic gifts by the Holy Spirit given the mandate by"],["438.8","Jesus himself now people nowadays will give themselves that title but that is a misappropriation they are not true"],["445.84","biblical apostles it's it's sort of like how people nowadays call each other king and queen you know you go queen right"],["453.599","you could call yourself that but you have no lands no people that recognize"],["459.599","you as such you have no real authority to declare yourself royalty jesus chose"],["466.16","the apostles there's no line of succession for the title to be passed to anyone else but Peter was an apostle his"],["474.08","doctrine came from the son of God his special revelation is from the Holy Spirit so do you think his knowledge"],["481.52","would be something of high value and importance there are lots of things that we can spend our time studying and"],["487.52","learning there's a steady stream of information available to us do we know"],["492.639","which we should prioritize what's worth our wild How about the knowledge concerning the"],["499.039","divine power that gives us everything pertaining to life and godliness how"],["504.8","about the concepts that make us partakers of the divine nature how about the formula the plan that if it is"],["512.64","followed provides you an entrance into everlasting kingdom"],["518.159","at the same time this knowledge will insulate you against artificial fake"],["524.88","false intelligence and that's never been more relevant as it is right now is it"],["530.48","you cannot trust what you see with your own eyes and what you hear with your own ears an uncanny tool for deception has"],["538.24","been invented an AI can show you and tell you anything"],["543.839","and most will be unable to discern fact from fiction and Peter understands all this and he's offering the most"],["550.399","essential knowledge that one could ever possess knowledge of our God and Savior"],["556.16","Jesus Christ last week"],["561.6","200 Christians were massacred in Nigeria by Islamic extremists last Friday their"],["569.519","houses while they were sleeping at night their houses were set on fire and as they rushed out to escape the fire they"],["575.519","were hacked to death with machetes there has been 10,000 Christians killed"],["582.56","in Nigeria over the last 3 years now for those people this knowledge is worth"],["589.6","losing their lives over they'd sooner die than deny their faith in Jesus so"],["595.68","they have been murdered and Peter he feels the same way that's how important"],["601.2","this knowledge is to Peter yet many people place so little value on this"],["606.24","information many people it it it just feels like a chore to come to church and"],["611.68","another boring sermon by Pastor Rob no fun learning about God or it's too"],["618.72","overwhelming like Tony having to hear all the instructions about the last will and testament could you just not die but that's the point isn't it could you just"],["625.6","not die that's not an option peter's about to die the people he's writing to"],["631.12","were like the brothers and sisters in Christ that we have in Nigeria they were under intense persecution both from the"],["636.959","Sanhedrin the ruling class of leaders in Jerusalem and from the Roman Empire"],["642.64","being a part of the first century church was probably the most dangerous thing you could do back in 66 AD when this"],["649.36","book was written but truth be told all life was fragile back then rome was"],["654.72","conquering the world so people were always in danger of being invaded and killed but so too were the Roman"],["660.88","soldiers who were always being commanded into battles that they could die in the Roman Empire was full of slaves and"],["667.76","slaves lives were cheap and expendable but the rulers themselves they always had a bullseye on their back julius Caesar he conquered the whole world he"],["674.24","was stabbed to death by his most trusted people a2 brute"],["680.079","show hands who here's not going to die okay which is why Peter's information is"],["686.48","so vital all flesh withers and fades away and"],["691.68","death comes to all people but Peter has the knowledge of the divine power that"],["696.959","supplies us an entrance into the heavenly kingdom and Peter saw it with his own eyes he saw Jesus on the mount"],["703.76","of transfiguration when his deity shone and his veil glory was revealed for that"],["708.8","moment and Peter heard God say \"This is my son listen to him.\" And Peter saw"],["714.64","that divine power for three years as he healed the sick and Jesus raised the dead and he he beheld Jesus the"],["721.44","resurrected savior himself he understood Jesus is God and the knowledge he wants"],["728.32","us to be reminded of is how to live life in such a way that we are prepared for"],["733.68","eternity this is a reoccurring theme in all of scripture that the life we live in this realm affects the life we live"],["740.24","in the next the life we live in this realm affects the life we live in the next so if you listen carefully he's"],["747.12","going to tell us what we ought to be doing now that's preparing us for the everlasting kingdom and it starts with"],["753.68","the first title that Peter uses for himself what did he title himself apostle what's the first title"],["760.399","bondervant in the ancient world a bondervant was someone who was a willing slave someone"],["767.519","who had been redeemed they are legally set free but they choose out of love and loyalty to their master to stay with him"],["775.12","and the Mosaic law gave a uh a whole prescription of this exodus 21 if the"],["780.32","servant says \"I love my master and my wife and children and I do not want to go free,\" then his master will take him"],["786.16","to the judges and they'll take him to the door and they'll pierce his ear with an all"],["791.76","and he will be a servant for life now we just spent five weeks learning about the"],["797.839","kinsman redeemer Jesus who paid our debt and brings us into the family giving us"],["803.36","an eternal inheritance we are the chosen people of God by faith followers of Jesus peter the apostle that sounds so"],["809.92","prestigious but in Peter's mind bond servant comes first"],["814.959","servant is what Jesus emphasized the son of man came not to be served but to"],["821.76","serve and that's who Peter's aspiring to be like and that's who we should all aspire to be like our servant king"],["829.2","here's the knowledge that Peter wants to remind us of verse two grace and peace"],["835.76","be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord as his divine"],["841.04","power has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by glory"],["846.959","and virtue by which have been given to us exceedingly great precious promises"],["852.88","that through these you are partakers of the divine nature escaping the corruption that is in this world through"],["859.36","lust there's a lot packed

it"],["1383.76","looked like trash right you know because No because you know like there's some three-year-old he's and you and they"],["1390","stick it up there and you'd be like \"Oh that's

lines so I never got the blue ribbon somebody else would always be up there"],["1410.08","at the top first place blue ribbon and I was down here with you know some herper that couldn't color within the lines"],["1417.6","and that was my first memory of having my skills judged you know if you"],["1424.96","couldn't color in the lines your coloring is not good and you know there's an object objective"],["1432.159","good that we always are trying to achieve i taught the boys when they cut grass yeah we're going to cut the grass and they're like you know let's get this"],["1439.28","done
