return what knowledge do I want you to have what's the last thing I want to"],["260.32","tell you in case I don't make it back the Apostle Paul the Apostle Peter is"],["266.88","having the same thoughts in this letter second Peter look look at verse 12 he"],["273.44","says \"For this reason I will not neglect to remind you always of these things"],["279.759","though you know and are established in this present truth yes I think it is right as long as I am in this tent to"],["287.199","stir up in you by reminding you knowing that surely I must put off my tent just"],["292.4","as

he"],["368.08","says for if these things are yours and abound you will neither be barren nor unfruitful in the what knowledge of our"],["375.12","Lord Jesus Christ and then all of verse 10 brethren be

with the church the people of faith so they would know how to carry on without him he's going to"],["405.6","give them the most important knowledge that he has do you think that would be significant the last words of Peter"],["412.72","i mean who we talking about peter who's Peter it's like the unspoken"],["418.72","leaders of the disciple of the Jesus right and he says he's a verse one Peter"],["424.56","is an apostle which is a rare thing in order to be qualified as apostle you had"],["430.56","to be directly taught by Christ himself and been given the apostolic gifts by the Holy Spirit given the mandate by"],["438.8","Jesus himself now people nowadays will give themselves that title but that is a misappropriation they are not true"],["445.84","biblical apostles it's it's sort of like how people nowadays call each other king and queen you know you go queen right"],["453.599","you could call yourself that but you have no lands no people that recognize"],["459.599","you as such you have no real authority to declare yourself royalty jesus chose"],["466.16","the apostles there's no line of succession for the title to be passed to anyone else but Peter was an apostle his"],["474.08","doctrine came from the son of God his special revelation is from the Holy Spirit so do you think his knowledge"],["481.52","would be something of high value and importance there are lots of things that we can spend our time studying and"],["487.52","learning there's a steady stream of information available to us do we know"],["492.639","which we should prioritize what's worth our wild How about the knowledge concerning the"],["499.039","divine power that gives us everything pertaining to life and godliness how"],["504.8","about the concepts that make us partakers of the divine nature how about the formula the plan that if it is"],["512.64","followed provides you an entrance into everlasting kingdom"],["518.159","at the same time this knowledge will insulate you against artificial fake"],["524.88","false intelligence and that's never been more relevant as it is right now is it"],["530.48","you cannot trust what you see with your own eyes and what you hear with your own ears an uncanny tool for deception has"],["538.24","been invented an AI can show you and tell you anything"],["543.839","and most will be unable to discern fact from fiction and Peter understands all this and he's offering the most"],["550.399","essential knowledge that one could ever possess knowledge of our God and Savior"],["556.16","Jesus Christ last week"],["561.6","200 Christians were massacred in Nigeria by Islamic extremists last Friday their"],["569.519","houses while they were sleeping at night their houses were set on fire and as they rushed out to escape the fire they"],["575.519","were hacked to death with machetes there has been 10,000 Christians killed"],["582.56","in Nigeria over the last 3 years now for those people this knowledge is worth"],["589.6","losing their lives over they'd sooner die than deny their faith in Jesus so"],["595.68","they have been murdered and Peter he feels the same way that's how important"],["601.2","this knowledge is to Peter yet many people place so little value on this"],["606.24","information many people it it it just feels like a chore to come to church and"],["611.68","another boring sermon by Pastor Rob no fun learning about God or it's too"],["618.72","overwhelming like Tony having to hear all the instructions about the last will and testament could you just not die but that's the point isn't it could you just"],["625.6","not die that's not an option peter's about to die the people he's writing to"],["631.12","were like the brothers and sisters in Christ that we have in Nigeria they were under intense persecution both from the"],["636.959","Sanhedrin the ruling class of leaders in Jerusalem and from the Roman Empire"],["642.64","being a part of the first century church was probably the most dangerous thing you could do back in 66 AD when this"],["649.36","book was written but truth be told all life was fragile back then rome was"],["654.72","conquering the world so people were always in danger of being invaded and killed but so too were the Roman"],["660.88","soldiers who were always being commanded into battles that they could die in the Roman Empire was full of slaves and"],["667.76","slaves lives were cheap and expendable but the rulers themselves they always had a bullseye on their back julius Caesar he conquered the whole world he"],["674.24","was stabbed to death by his most trusted people a2 brute"],["680.079","show hands who here's not going to die okay which is why Peter's information is"],["686.48","so vital all flesh withers and fades away and"],["691.68","death comes to all people but Peter has the knowledge of the divine power that"],["696.959","supplies us an entrance into the heavenly kingdom and Peter saw it with his own eyes he saw Jesus on the mount"],["703.76","of transfiguration when his deity shone and his veil glory was revealed for that"],["708.8","moment and Peter heard God say \"This is my son listen to him.\" And Peter saw"],["714.64","that divine power for three years as he healed the sick and Jesus raised the dead and he he beheld Jesus the"],["721.44","resurrected savior himself he understood Jesus is God and the knowledge he wants"],["728.32","us to be reminded of is how to live life in such a way that we are prepared for"],["733.68","eternity this is a reoccurring theme in all of scripture that the life we live in this realm affects the life we live"],["740.24","in the next the life we live in this realm affects the life we live in the next so if you listen carefully he's"],["747.12","going to tell us what we ought to be doing now that's preparing us for the everlasting kingdom and it starts with"],["753.68","the first title that Peter uses for himself what did he title himself apostle what's the first title"],["760.399","bondervant in the ancient world a bondervant was someone who was a willing slave someone"],["767.519","who had been redeemed they are legally set free but they choose out of love and loyalty to their master to stay with him"],["775.12","and the Mosaic law gave a uh a whole prescription of this exodus 21 if the"],["780.32","servant says \"I love my master and my wife and children and I do not want to go free,\" then his master will take him"],["786.16","to the judges and they'll take him to the door and they'll pierce his ear with an all"],["791.76","and he will be a servant for life now we just spent five weeks learning about the"],["797.839","kinsman redeemer Jesus who paid our debt and brings us into the family giving us"],["803.36","an eternal inheritance we are the chosen people of God by faith followers of Jesus peter the apostle that sounds so"],["809.92","prestigious but in Peter's mind bond servant comes first"],["814.959","servant is what Jesus emphasized the son of man came not to be served but to"],["821.76","serve and that's who Peter's aspiring to be like and that's who we should all aspire to be like our servant king"],["829.2","here's the knowledge that Peter wants to remind us of verse two grace and peace"],["835.76","be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord as his divine"],["841.04","power has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by glory"],["846.959","and virtue by which have been given to us exceedingly great precious promises"],["852.88","that through these you are partakers of the divine nature escaping the corruption that is in this world through"],["859.36","lust there's a lot packed

it"],["1383.76","looked like trash right you know because No because you know like there's some three-year-old he's and you and they"],["1390","stick it up there and you'd be like \"Oh that's

lines so I never got the blue ribbon somebody else would always be up there"],["1410.08","at the top first place blue ribbon and I was down here with you know some herper that couldn't color within the lines"],["1417.6","and that was my first memory of having my skills judged you know if you"],["1424.96","couldn't color in the lines your coloring is not good and you know there's an object objective"],["1432.159","good that we always are trying to achieve i taught the boys when they cut grass yeah we're going to cut the grass and they're like you know let's get this"],["1439.28","done

They seem like lovely people. Sunny to the left of us, Melvin"],["113.759","over here on this side of the street, and Big Ed lived behind us.

That's a reality.

But he gives us examples. He gives us evidence"],["386.08","to back up his assertions. So I said, if you want to know the details, you got to"],["391.12","come back. And apparently you did. So you're interested to find out these examples. So chapter 2, verse number"],["397.68","four. Here's go Peter's examples to back up the threat of destruction."],["404.24","He says,\"For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to"],["409.84","hell and delivered them into the chains of darkness to be reserved for judgment,"],["414.88","and he did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in"],["421.68","the flood on the world of the ungodly, and turning the cities of Sodom and"],["427.599","Gomorrah, into ashes, condemning them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterwards would live ungodly"],["436.16","and delivered righteous Lot who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of their wicked of the wicked. For that righteous"],["442.16","man dwelling among them tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds. Then"],["450.479","the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to reserve the"],["456.319","unjust under punishment for the day of judgment. and especially those who walk according"],["462.96","to the flesh in the lust of uncleanliness and despise authorities."],["468.4","So Peter gives us a history lesson to back up his claims that God will bring"],["474.16","judgment. Three examples, the angels who sinned, the ancient world destroyed by"],["479.28","the flood, and Sodom and Gomorrah. Three of the biggest examples from Genesis,"],["485.68","the three that shocked and amazed people for generations. Also, the three events recorded in the"],["493.12","Bible that many people have a hard time accepting as true. They seem so extreme"],["499.84","and so wild. That's like nothing we've ever witnessed. And you want to know why that is?"],["507.199","Because these judgments were so effective, you only had to see it once."],["513.599","Thereafter, the threat, the warning of judgment was more than enough to keep"],["519.12","the most of humanity away from completely going evil."],["525.2","When I was in school, there were teachers who we'd act up in their"],["530.8","classes all day long because they never did anything to stop us. One math"],["536.8","teacher we had, he was always drunk or dealing with a hangover. And he did not"],["543.76","care what we did. He, it seemed like there was no line. He had no line for us"],["549.12","to cross. And we spent the entire year trying to see if we could find a line."],["555.36","And the whole time we were in his class, we were testing to see what can we get"],["560.64","away with. you know, it's a third story window, so we would just throw paper and"],["565.839","textbooks and whatever junk out the window just to see if we catch his attention. And uh we would just mess up"],["574.08","our desk and mess up our chairs and just break the things. And one guy took out a"],["579.36","knife and he cut all of the drapes into little strips. And another fella pulled out a lighter and he lit his desk on"],["586.88","fire. and and it was a game we played to see if"],["593.36","we'd even get his attention. And rarely he'd barely look up at us."],["601.12","Meanwhile, we had other teachers we didn't utter a peep in their classes."],["606.959","Mrs. Bryant was an old lady with a bamboo stick."],["612.64","She never smiled and she was always on the edge of snapping. And if she heard a"],["618.079","noise, she'd turn around and bang, she'd hit the desk right in front of you and scare the devil right out of you."],["625.36","Teachers were permitted to strap us on the hand or have us stand up and give us some swats on the hind end. And there"],["634.24","were teachers who were notorious for strapping, but Mrs. Bryant was in a league of her own. She was just looking"],["640.64","for an excuse to beat a child's butt. So, you never heard anyone"],["647.6","speak, chew a gum, pass a note, drop a pencil,"],["657.2","look sideways. Nobody ever acted up in Mrs. Bryan's class. In math class, we lit desk on"],["664.399","fire. Same kids, different results."],["670.079","Because we'd seen the punishment Mrs. Bryant would deliver, everyone knew,"],["675.12","don't test her, you'll suffer. My point is the things that we study today, God's"],["681.12","punishment was so severe after it happened, most people got the message. God made his point. Most people"],["687.839","recognize the wrath of God is a real thing. We better keep ourselves and we better keep our communities in check or"],["694.32","else. So yes, we have never seen God's"],["699.839","severe wrath like these three examples because things haven't gotten that bad"],["707.519","yet. First time God's wrath was severe. We see in verse number four, Peter says,"],["713.68","\"The angels themselves who sinned, cast down to hell, delivered"],["719.519","into the chains of darkness to be reserved for judgment.\" Wow. What do they do? Well, Peter"],["725.6","doesn't elaborate on that. The fact that he doesn't elaborate seems to indicate that his audience already knows what"],["731.12","he's talking about, so he doesn't go into details. Jude likewise references this event with the angels in much the"],["738.24","same way. Jude, like Peter, was warning the church about ungodly people pretending to be of the faith, but"],["745.12","they're not believers and they have evil intentions. Turn over a couple pages uh"],["750.48","to your this way towards Revelation. Uh it's like two books over Jude uh chapter"],["756.16","1 because there's only one chapter. Verse number four, and we read, \"Certain men have crept in"],["763.6","unnoticed who long ago were marked out for this condemnation. ungodly men who"],["768.959","turn the grace of our God into lwdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord"],["775.519","Jesus Christ. But I'm rem want want to remind you though you once knew this"],["781.92","that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed those who did not believe and"],["788.88","the angels who did not keep their proper domain but left their own abode. He has reserved in everlasting chains under"],["795.44","darkness for the judgment of the great day as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities"],["801.36","around them in the similar manner to these having given themselves over to"],["806.959","sexual immorality and have gone after strange flesh are set forth as example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."],["816.56","So, just like Peter, Jude uses two of the same examples of God's judgment to"],["822.48","warn the church, to warn us of what happens when people fall away from the"],["827.519","faith. These angels, Peter says, who did not keep their proper domain but left"],["832.88","their abode are now in chains, held captive"],["838.24","because whatever they did, and Peter or Jude don't tell us specifically what sin"],["844.32","the angels did other than Jude says, \"Well, they didn't keep their proper domain.\" So Jude's audience, like"],["849.6","Peter's audience, seems to know what these authors are referring to. Apparently, everybody knew what those"],["855.68","angels did. Do you know? Do you know what those angels did? Turn to Genesis"],["862.88","6. Let's go right back to the source material, the very beginning. Genesis"],["868.399","6:es [Music] 1-"],["874.88","8. Let me pick it up here."],["880.72","It came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, the"],["885.76","daughters were born to them. The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were beautiful, and they took wise for"],["892.56","themselves of all whom they chose. And the spir the Lord said, \"My spirit will not strive with man forever, for he is"],["898.72","indeed flesh, yet his day shall be 120 years.\" There were giants on the earth in those days and also after when the"],["906","sons of God came into the daughters of men and they bore children to them. They"],["911.44","were the mighty men who were old of old men of renown. The Lord saw the"],["916.56","wickedness of man was great on the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And"],["923.76","the Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth and he was grieved in his heart. So the Lord said, \"I will destroy"],["930.16","man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing, birds of the air. I am sorry that"],["937.36","I made them.\" But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. So taking that at"],["945.199","face value, it means angels somehow had sexual relations with human women and spawned a hybrid offspring. This is what"],["953.04","Jude means when he says the angels did not keep their proper domain. The"],["958.24","offspring of these angels and human women was a race of mighty men called"],["963.519","the Nephilim or called the giants and these giants were very evil and"],["971.36","corrupted the entire world and all of humanity became very evil. In the"],["977.04","there's an ancient book that was written in around 300 BC called the book of Enoch and it gives much greater detail"],["984.399","about these angels and all that they did. So the book of Enoch tells us the oral traditions that the Israelites"],["991.36","learned and passed down about these fallen angels. So according to the book of Enoch, 200 angels conspired to come"],["998.16","down to earth, live with humans, marry the women, and teach forbidden knowledge. Their offspring, the"],["1004","Nephilim, were also called giants, were powerful and violent, and their appetites were insatiable. They killed"],["1010.32","and they plundered to such an extent that most of humanity was corrupted by their bloodline. So the book of Enoch is"],["1017.839","not included in the Jewish scriptures. It is not part of the Old Testament. So we don't view its details as the"],["1024.64","inspired word of God. But what the book of Enoch does, it provides us the"],["1029.919","understanding of what Peter and Jude's audiences learned or understood the"],["1035.52","interpretations of Genesis 6 to be. The book of Enoch fills in elaborate narrative. But Genesis 6 alone gives us"],["1042.959","the facts. Gives us alone the facts that the angels left their domain, cohabitated with the humans, and their"],["1048.4","offspring corrupted the world. Peter and Jude revealed to us that the angels who"],["1053.84","did this were severely punished, locked away in an abyss, held in chains of"],["1060","darkness till the great judgment. Oh, that's just crazy. I've never heard such"],["1065.52","a thing. That's got to be a myth. That is true. We don't see angels mating with humans anymore."],["1072.4","I wonder why. Could it be that the rest of the angels saw how severe God's wrath was and"],["1079.2","concluded, \"Oh, that ain't worth it. Let's remain in our proper domain and"],["1084.72","not try to procreate with humans. It's only going to get us destroyed.\" Because"],["1089.919","after all, that is Peter's point. That's the point he's trying to make. And the destruction was not just on the angels."],["1096.64","In the same chapter of Genesis chapter 6 can he connects the story of the angels"],["1102","spawning the Nephilim hybrid race to the flood of Noah which is Peter's second"],["1108.32","example in Peter 2 verse number five. He said"],["1114.72","and did not spare the ancient world but saved Noah one of eight people a preacher of righteousness bringing in"],["1120.559","the flood on the world of the ungodly."],["1125.76","So wicked, so corrupt was the entire population of the earth that only Noah was determined to be righteous. Genesis"],["1133.12","6 verse 5-8. The Lord saw the wickedness of man was great. The intent of the"],["1139.2","thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. The Lord was sorry that he made man on the earth. It grieved his"],["1145.679","heart. So the Lord said, \"I'm going to destroy man whom I've created from the face of"],["1150.88","the earth, man and beast, creeping things, birds of the air. I'm sorry. I made them. But Noah found grace in the"],["1158.48","eyes of the Lord. Since everyone was evil, God sent the flood to destroy all life with the"],["1165.2","exception of Noah and his eight family members and the animals that got on the"],["1170.72","ark. And Peter's point is these false teachers,"],["1176","their disobedience and uncleanliness is only going to result in destruction. So"],["1181.2","keep the false teachers out of the church. And then he gives one last example of destruction. Peter quotes and"],["1188.16","so does Jude. Sodom and Gomorrah. These cities were in the time of Abraham. And"],["1195.44","like the pre flood civilization, these cities were totally corrupted. Turn to"],["1201.84","Genesis chapter 19. Let's read the story of Sodom and Gomorrah."],["1210.799","All right. Chapter 19. In Genesis, now the two angels came to Sodom in the"],["1217.12","evening. Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose up, met them, bowed himself with his face"],["1223.28","towards the ground, and he said, \"Here now, my lords, please turn into your servants's house and spend the night,"],["1229.2","wash your feet, and then you can rise up early and go on your way.\" And they"],["1234.64","said, \"Nah, we'll spend the night in the open square.\""],["1239.76","But Lot insisted strongly. So they turned into him and entered his house."],["1246","Then he made them a feast and baked unleaven bread and they ate. Now before they laid down the men of the"],["1253.28","city, the men of Sodom, old and young, all the people from every quarter"],["1258.559","surrounded the house, and they called to Lot and said, \"Where's the men who came to you tonight? bring them out to us so"],["1266","we can know them carnally. Lot went out to them through the"],["1271.2","doorway, shut the door behind, and he said, \"Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly. See now I have two daughters"],["1278.72","who have not known men. Please let them bring let let me bring them out to you,"],["1284.08","and you may do with them as you wish. Only do nothing to these men, since this"],["1289.36","is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.\" And they said, \"Stand back.\" Then they said, \"This one,"],["1296","he came to stay here, and he keeps acting as a judge. Now we will deal"],["1301.28","worse with you than with them.\" So they pressed hard against the man Lot. They came near to break down the door. But"],["1307.84","the men, the angels, reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. And then they"],["1313.6","struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that it became weary,"],["1320.24","trying to find the door. So the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah is that"],["1325.6","they were so sexually deviant that the entire city would wanted to pray on"],["1332.08","helpless travelers. Two male travelers weren't safe in that city after"],["1338","nightfall. Lot the nephew of Abraham is the only righteous person in the city."],["1344.4","And he tried to protect these angels who are disguised as guys traveling. He"],["1349.6","insisted that they stay in his house for the night. And all the men in the evening showed up at Lost Door,"],["1356.72","demanding the travelers be brought out so they could violate them. The men wanted to violate these other men. But"],["1364.64","the angels blinded the people of the city and then they compelled Lot and his family to leave because God is going to"],["1371.44","destroy this wicked culture. And God does. He rains down fire and brimstone and destroys everyone in those cities."],["1379.76","So Sodom is comparable to the days of Noah where the entire city is given over"],["1386.72","to perversion and violence. Not the whole world at that time just for"],["1391.919","whatever reason these two cities was a concentration of immorality. So there's"],["1397.2","your three examples in the background, the history, three testimonies of God's judgment and destruction that comes when"],["1404.32","people give themselves over to filthy conduct and lawless deeds. And while yes, it is true that all people are"],["1412.559","sinners and there has been many horrible examples of cruelty and injustice and"],["1419.44","godless behavior in every and all culture the world over. Nevertheless, it"],["1425.52","has never gotten to the extent of what humanity was like before the flood or"],["1430.72","how deviant the entire population of Sodom and Gomorrah was. As perverted as"],["1436.559","America is in 2025, we're not as perverted as they were in Sodom and Gomorrah. So, yay."],["1445.919","So, we've never seen this in our time. this level of judgment. Those events"],["1451.12","happened long ago and far away. And some people speculate, well, since we don't"],["1456.32","see that level of judgment and wrath from God, probably that's not true. That's just all made up. You know,"],["1461.6","that's that's just a scare tactic. That doesn't happen in"],["1466.88","real life. And why do you suppose that is?"],["1472.159","Because as bad as things get, there is still some element, some"],["1478.96","percentage of the population that will exercise some level of restraint. There"],["1484.32","is a percentage of the population that does fear God, that can spot the"],["1489.679","patterns, can connect the dots and see that wickedness leads to destruction, godless living leads to death,"],["1496.159","immorality leads to poverty and shame and ruin. Meanwhile, there is another way to live that leads to blessings and"],["1503.279","peace. And since there is enough percentage of the population that will strive to live good, even though we're"],["1509.36","not perfect, but we are humble and repentant and faithful of enough that it"],["1515.919","promotes God to be patient. And I'm not just making that up, just pulling that"],["1522.159","out of my hat. This is literally what God said to Abraham before the angels"],["1527.84","went down to destroy Sodom. Abraham advocates for mercy for those cities. Go"],["1533.84","to Genesis chapter 18. Let me read to you this interesting discussion God has"],["1540.159","with Abraham. This is Genesis 18 picking it up at"],["1545.2","verse 20. And the Lord said,"],["1550.72","\"Because of the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grave, I will go down now and"],["1558.48","see whether they have done alltogether according to the outcry against it that"],["1563.919","has come up to me, and it and if not, I will know.\" So the men turned away from"],["1570.08","there and went towards Sodom. So that's the two angels. Okay? But Abraham stood before the Lord."],["1576.64","Abraham came near and said, \"Would you also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Suppose suppose there's"],["1584.64","50 righteous within the city. Would you destroy the place and not spare it for the 50 righteous that are in it?\" Far be"],["1591.6","it from you to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the"],["1597.039","wicked. Far be it from you. You shall not the judge of all the earth do right?"],["1603.52","And the Lord said, \"If I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city, I will"],["1611.52","spare all the place for their sakes.\" Abraham answered and said, \"Indeed now,"],["1619.039","I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord."],["1624.96","Suppose there were five less than 50 righteous. Would you destroy the city for a lack of five?\" So he said, \"If"],["1632.08","there are 45, I will not destroy it.\" And he spoke to him again and said, \"Suppose there's 40 found there.\" And he"],["1640.159","said, \"I won't destroy it for the sake of 40.\" And then he said, \"Let not the Lord be angry and I will speak. Suppose"],["1646.4","30 should be found there.\" He said, \"I won't destroy it if I find 30 there.\" And he said, \"Indeed now, man, this guy,"],["1651.52","he should be in contracts, right? Like this guy can negotiate.\" Abraham says, verse 31, \"Indeed now, I've taken it"],["1658.4","upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose 20 be found there. And he said, I won't destroy for the sake of 20. And"],["1664.159","he said, let not the Lord be angry. I'll speak one more time. Just one more time. Suppose 10 be found. And he said, I will"],["1670.4","not destroy it for the sake of 10. So the Lord went his way as soon as he"],["1676.559","was finished speaking with Abraham. Abraham returned to his place."],["1682.64","Very insightful interaction. Through it, we learn there is a level of"],["1687.84","abomination that God will not tolerate. However, if there is a percentage of the population that's righteous, a very"],["1695.12","small fraction, for their sake, he would withhold judgments."],["1701.52","And then we remember the words of the Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter 5."],["1707.919","He tells his followers, \"You are the salt of the earth.\" But if the salt"],["1714.159","loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned?

And for the"],["1808.24","longest times, those three examples, Sodom and Gomorrah, the flood, the angels were very effective warnings. But"],["1815.679","now we see people who scoff at those examples. They don't believe in fallen"],["1820.88","angels. They don't believe in the abyss. They don't believe in a global flood that happened. They don't believe Sodom"],["1826.159","was a real place or God would ever be so vengeful and bring destruction on people. Look at look at Peter's"],["1832.399","description of folks. Verse number 10, chapter 2, 10. Actually, pick it up in"],["1838.64","verse 9. Then the Lord knows how to deliver godly out of temptation and reserve the unjust under punishment for"],["1844.32","the day of judgment and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanliness and despise"],["1851.36","authority. Peter says, \"God will deliver the godly"],["1856.799","out of temptation, reserve the unjust for punishment, especially those who walk according to the flesh, and then"],["1863.52","the lust of uncleanliness.\" So, let's break that phrase down. That's a very important, especially those, right?"],["1869.679","Those who walk. Walk is the biblical language that means doesn't literally mean walk.

And yet, this is what is promoted in many churches in"],["2005.12","Western Europe and North America. Like I said last week, the false teachers have"],["2010.159","taken over many of the pulpits, denominations, and seminaries. And we see it all around us. And then we look"],["2017.12","at Hollywood.

We pray"],["2811.28","for people to be stirred up to leave apostate churches and find places of"],["2816.64","worship that do teach the word of God.

Yes,"],["34.239","denim with denim. We wore the Canadian tuxedo."],["42.48","It's very attractive. I also played a lot of sports, so you know, had sports clothes, pants, you know, shorts and all"],["48.16","that, but mostly that's what my wardrobe was. On Sundays, of course, I had Sunday clothes, uh, button-down shirts, dress"],["54.239","pants, dress shoes, ties, sweaters. I didn't wear any of that school. That was just only for church. Now, when I came"],["61.039","down here to uh Washington Bible College out in Lam, uh there their school had a"],["66.479","dress code and to class, you could not wear jeans or t-shirts. And so, I read"],["74","the student man uh handbook and I decided, well, I got to wear my church"],["79.84","clothes to class. So, that's what I did. I wore my church clothes and uh that was"],["85.52","fine according to the dress code. But uh most of the American kids, they had cargo pants, some cool uh pockets and"],["94.72","the pleated in the you know that eight ladies early 90s everything was big pleated hammer pants, you know, and uh"],["101.439","they had all kinds of those types of styles going on and printed shirts and styles. And I didn't have any of that. I"],["109.68","had your basic straight leg pants with no pleats and just a white button-d down collar shirt. So, within a week, I"],["116.64","realized I'm out of style and I look more like the professors, not one of the"],["121.84","students. So, I went shopping. I found Ross's Dress for Less"],["128.56","and I got some cargo pants with some cool pockets and a couple of new shirts."],["133.68","And fortunately, I made a friend who had lots of clothes and he just gave me a bunch of stuff. So, I got a real quick"],["139.76","wardrobe upgrade. Uh, it wasn't good being out of style. It was severely"],["144.8","hindering my social status, my cool factor. I did not have good riz, as the"],["151.28","kids nowadays uh say. No, they don't. Just old people trying to be cool say"],["157.599","dumb things like that. But, uh, you know how you do when you're struggling, right? You pick up some new clothes here"],["162.879","and there, clearance racks, you know, maybe Christmas and birthdays, you get some stuff. And and in college, you get"],["168.239","to beg, borrow, and steal clothes off your roommate or a buddy. Uh, incidentally, Pastor Mark had a lot of"],["175.28","ties, and I used to go down there and poach ties every once in a while from him. He never wears a tie now. You never"],["180.959","see him in it. I still have his ties, actually. So, I'm wearing I'm wearing them. So, within a couple years, you"],["187.12","know, by my through my college years, I picked up uh things I could afford and I thought I had upgraded my look to"],["193.36","decent. And then I started dating Elelliana and I learned that I was kind of lacking"],["201.68","particularly with my shoes. I wore white shoes. Not white as in"],["210","color white shoes. Apparently us white boys had a shoe style that she thought"],["216.239","was weird. But uh by then I I wasn't all that phased by what people thought about my wardrobe. I had developed the"],["222.56","attitude if you don't like my clothes, feel free to buy me some you do like and you know I might wear them depending on"],["230.319","your style you know what you like to wear. But after college I started as a uh youth pastor played a lot of"],["236","basketball with the kids so I was wearing a lot of sports gear but then in 1997 something really crazy happened."],["242.48","the the pastor had resigned and at 26 years of age I was like hey you're the pastor you know you're going from youth"],["248.879","to pastor of the church fa uh people's church and uh there I was but I was"],["254.64","still coaching a lot of basketball and playing a lot of basketball wearing my basketball shorts and one afternoon and"],["262","I uh went for uh our little mall uh to go for a walk around the mall and I was"],["267.36","dressed to play ball later on with the teens and as you as it happens in a small town, you know, you come across"],["273.919","people you know and uh we people from church. So this dear old lady and her"],["278.96","friend and we did the warm greeting. Oh, hello Mrs. Wood. Good to see you. And she introduced me to her friend and she"],["284.96","said, \"Uh this is this is our pastor. Uh but he doesn't always dress like this.\""],["291.68","So after a brief discussion, we went on our way and Ilana with all of her keen social awareness, she says, \"You know,"],["298.72","Rob, if you want to be these people's pastor, you need to look the part. You"],["305.44","know, the basketball gear's fine when you're playing ball, but if we're going to go out into the community, we're"],["310.639","going to go to the mall, you need to look more like the pastor.\" So once"],["315.759","again, I became aware that my look didn't fit. So as we close uh this"],["322.4","letter in second Peter, we have this challenge from Peter who gives us good reasons to be looking for Jesus. And"],["329.28","while we're looking for Jesus, he instructs us that we ought to be looking like Jesus. So let's look at second"],["336.24","Peter chapter 3 and we're going to close out the chapter today. But just a little"],["342.56","bit review, we'll pick it up in verse 10. set the context. So 2 Peter 3:10, but the day of the Lord will come as a"],["348.639","thief in the night in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent"],["354.32","heat, both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore,"],["359.44","since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of person ought you be in holy conduct and godliness,"],["366.24","looking for and hastening the coming day of the Lord, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on"],["372.56","fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for a new heaven and"],["378.72","a new earth in which righteousness dwells. Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to"],["386.56","be found in him in peace without spot and blameless. So, Peter asks, and he's"],["394","concluding his letter now, since the judgment is coming, the day of the Lord is going to bring destruction, but I"],["400.56","have offered you the knowledge of how to escape the judgment, how to gain entrance into the everlasting kingdom of"],["406.319","our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Since you have all this knowledge, what manner of person ought you be? Now,"],["413.28","Peter is looking for his audience to now make some applications. A good sermon provides you with applications. A"],["419.759","lecture or a seminar gives you a lot of information. Peter has given the information. Now, he wants the listener to go and connect the dots and apply it."],["427.599","Some people are keenly interested in a lot of different subject matter that has no practical application. I I learned"],["435.52","that the University of Wisconsin once offered a course in Elfish,"],["441.36","the fictitious language spoken by the elves in the Lord of the Rings series."],["446.8","Uh they were teaching that at the University of Wisconsin. Does that have any practical application to speak"],["452.72","elfish? But not to be outdone, Michigan State University has a course on surviving the"],["459.28","coming zombie apocalypse. If you ever wanted to know if you could make it through a zombie apocalypse, good news."],["465.039","Michigan State University is going to teach you that class so you can survive that. So these are actual classes where"],["472.16","people paid money for. And I don't blame the school because if people want to buy that information, why not sell it to"],["478.8","them? Doesn't matter if it's inapplicable. So we have a bunch of random knowledge in our heads that has"],["484.639","no practical application. And Peter's not trying to give us headacking. He's"],["489.84","expecting the knowledge to change us. So he answers the question. The question"],["496.16","was, \"What manner of person ought you be?\" And then he answers it in verse 14. Therefore, beloved, looking forward to"],["501.759","these things, be diligent to be found in him at peace without spot and blemish."],["508.96","Without spot and blemish. What does that mean? This description mirrors what other New Testament authors said. Paul"],["515.599","in first Timothy said that you keep this commandment without spot blameless until"],["521.839","the Lord Jesus Christ appearing. And then James says pure and undefiled religion before God in the father is"],["528.64","this. Visit the orphans and the widows in their trouble and keep oneself unspotted. There it is again. Unspotted"],["535.2","from the world. No spot or blemish. Sounds also like how Peter described Jesus in 1 Peter chapter 1 verse number"],["543.76","18. He said, \"Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things like silver or gold from your aimless conduct"],["551.04","received by the traditions of your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish.\""],["559.279","And there it is again, without blemish or spot. So this description is continually coming up. And also it is in"],["568.08","contrast to how the false teachers are described in chapter 2. Remember second"],["574.64","in Peter chapter 2 he said in verse 12 that these false teachers are natural"],["580.08","beasts who made to be caught and destroyed. They speak evil of things they don't understand. They they will"],["586","utter utterly perish in their own corruption and will receive the wages as of unrighteousness as those who count it"],["592.64","pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes. You see that"],["597.839","there? They are spots and blemishes. Verse number 15. carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you"],["603.6","having eyes full of adultery and they cannot cease to sin in ta enticing"],["608.959","unstable souls. So Peter says we are to be without spot and blemish unlike the"],["615.2","false teachers who are spotted and blemished."],["621.519","So what is that supposed to mean? Well, the Greek word here apisto"],["627.36","is literally means free from stain blemish physically and morally is how"],["634.32","the Greek would have used it. They could have been used in both physically or morally. So it's like is it physical like does Peter say that we shouldn't"],["640.88","have zits or scars? No, he's interested in moral purity."],["649.279","Peter is calling Christians to live lives free from the corruption and the sinful behaviors different from the"],["655.36","false teachers who are spotted and blemished. Okay. So, Peter's phrase without spot reflects a deep biblical"],["662.399","theme. It connects the imagery of garments throughout scripture where clothes symbolizes a person's spiritual"],["670.399","condition. On the one hand, white clean clothes symbolizes in scripture"],["675.839","righteousness. But on the other hand, dirty stained clothes symbolize impurities or sin. Clothing in garments"],["684.56","are often used as a metaphor. So today I am practicing what Hollywood calls"],["690.399","method dressing. Like that. Did you notice? Did you Did"],["696.48","you notice I was wearing No. Nobody Nobody even paid attention. Right. So, method dressing is a fashion trend where"],["704.24","actors and celebrities wear outfits that reflect the characters they play or the"],["709.6","themes of the film, even offscreen, especially during press conferences or red carpet events. It's essentially"],["715.839","turning a promotional appearance into an immersive storytelling moment. So, method dressing, I dressed to illustrate"],["724.079","the sermon. Bear in mind, I already admitted to you, I have a limited wardrobe. So, if you"],["730.079","think my method dressing game is weak, well, I already told you my philosophy. If you don't like my clothes, you can buy me some that you do like."],["737.6","So, let's talk about the garment metaphor. We see in the Old Testament with uh"],["744.56","Isaiah the prophet, he says, \"He has clothed me with garments of salvation and he's wrapped me in a robe of"],["751.279","righteousness.\" So, those the literal clothes are symbolizing something. We see uh both"],["759.279","sides of it with uh Zachchariah, both the filthy and the clean garments in the"],["764.56","same passage. So Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and this was the high priest and he was standing before the"],["770.639","angel. And then he answered and spoke to those who stood before him saying, \"Take away the filthy garments from him.\" And"],["777.2","to him he said, \"See, I've removed your iniquity from you and I will clothe you with rich robes.\" So the high priest's"],["784.16","filthy garments symbolizing sin and God replaced them with these robes, these"],["789.519","rich robes representing clean and forgiven, restored. So this mirrors the"],["797.6","transformation Peter is calling for us to be without spots, putting off the old"],["804.16","sinful nature. We also see Jesus weaving this"],["810","understanding of the clothes you're wearing saying something into his parable of the wedding. You remember the"],["815.44","parable of the wedding where the king wanted people to come to the wedding and they couldn't get anybody to come to the wedding. So they they went out and"],["821.04","invited anybody out in the highways. So this one guy comes to the wedding, but he didn't come with the wedding clothes."],["827.839","He just showed up with his Crocs on or, you know, just his jeans and t-shirts"],["833.12","and his Canadian tuxedo. And um and then ge the as the the story goes on. Jesus"],["838.48","says the king saw the man. He said you know how did you get in here without the proper wedding garments and they kicked"],["844.959","him out. And um the the wedding proper wedding attire symbolized someone being"],["850.639","unprepared spiritually to go into the kingdom of heaven. That was the point of the parable. But when I was little and we used to read that book I I was very"],["857.199","sad cuz I I didn't understand the imagery. I just thought the guy got kicked out of the wedding cuz he didn't"],["862.48","have good clothes. And I thought that was kind of cruel, but the garment in that parable is a metaphor of the"],["868.16","righteousness required to enter the kingdom of heaven. It's a great illustration because Jesus audience"],["874.959","related to the scenario. It would have been culturally taboo. It would have been offensive to show up at a wedding"],["880.88","not dressed for the occasion. And I think that resonates with people in all generations. And even even today, even"],["888.079","with our most bluecollar, camelwaring dudes, generally they will put on a"],["894.24","button-down shirt and maybe even a tie, maybe even a tie for a wedding. Our"],["899.44","culture is very casual, isn't it? It's not uncommon to see people just kind of wearing some old some old sweats to a"],["907.6","nice restaurant or maybe some PJs and slippers out around town. And the older"],["913.04","generation just shakes their head and frowns at that. And when I say older generation, I mean me."],["919.839","Because, you know, I'm getting more opinionated and more crotchety or is that even a word? Crot. I don't know."],["925.839","Cranky. Is that a better word? I'm getting crankier the older I get. You know, even though we were poor, I had"],["932.56","Sunday clothes. My dad always believed you need one good suit for nice"],["937.92","occasions. I don't know if you ever noticed, my dad whenever he comes and preaches, he always wears a suit,"],["943.6","doesn't he? Wears a suit. He He always says he's always into nice shoes and"],["948.959","jewelry. He's always got bling on. And um the boy said, \"Grampy should have"],["955.199","been an Italian mafia because that's really his style.\""],["961.839","So, it's an inside joke with the family. But, uh, that's where the expression"],["969.36","Sunday best comes from, right? The notion that when you're going to a special occasion like a wedding, you're"],["975.68","going to dress up. If you are, uh, going to a job interview, you're going to meet someone important, uh, you want to make"],["981.36","a good impression. So, uh, if you're going to, you know, worship God, then you want to meet with him and, uh, maybe"],["988","you want to method dress, method dress for the occasion. Now the problem with that of course is when like the"],["994.639","Pharisees, people think that the clothes that the attire makes you spiritual and"],["1001.12","uh all you have to do is method dress, you know, just put on the the good clothes and then tada, you're godly."],["1008.8","And that's where people confuse the metaphor. They take it literally. So me"],["1014.079","wearing white, that doesn't make me righteous. Because you dress the part,"],["1019.279","you're still a sinner. Whether you have to repent to get the actual spiritual"],["1026","cleanliness. So I actually think nowadays the reverse is often true. Many times people are more sanctified on the"],["1032.48","inside than their outward appearance would indicate. Hey, I think that's true"],["1037.52","of a lot of people. They're walking around and there's nothing wrong with being casual. you know, I was just being looking like a sweaty kid in the mall."],["1044.48","Uh, that's what I looked like, but I was I was the pastor of the church. So, you you may not look like much on the"],["1050.08","outside, but remember what Samuel the prophet said, God does not see ma as man"],["1056.08","sees. Man looks on the outward appearance, but God looks at the the heart. The heart is the main"],["1063.84","thing God focuses on. The spot and the blemish is not on your clothes. It's on your heart, your soul, your character."],["1070.48","So that's why we do not have a dress code at Faith Bible Church. So Caleb was getting really nervous up here. He's"],["1076.08","like, \"Where's Pastor Rob going with this?\" Like, \"You don't need to worry, K. We got no dress code. We want people"],["1081.52","to just come and fit in and worship God and be comfortable with whatever they're"],["1086.96","wearing.\" Mike Hurley had on the Canadian tuxedo this morning and I was like, \"Good job, Mike. You are my"],["1092.96","illustration today.\" So we care about heart, not style. Right? So in Revelation, the"],["1099.76","entire theme of garments is pulled together when the believers are given"],["1104.799","white robes washed in the blood of the lamb representing the righteousness of Christ and the faithful acts of the"],["1111.76","saints. And we see this several times in the book of Revelation uh chapter 3."],["1117.039","They will walk with me in white for they are worthy. So the white garments represent the faithfulness and purity of"],["1124.24","the saints. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb. And that links purity directly to"],["1132.4","this Christ's sacrifice. What he did to pay for our sins, not what we do, what"],["1139.12","he did, washed in the blood of the lamb. So as throughout the New Testament, all"],["1144.64","throughout the New Testament, the church is portrayed as the bride of Christ, sanctified and made ready for the"],["1151.12","marriage supper of the lamb where purity and preparedness is essential for us to"],["1158.48","be part of that be part of that uh marriage supper. Christ sacrificed his blood to cleanse"],["1166.24","us. That's what that is symbolizing. His blood cleanses us. That sounds so counterintuitive."],["1172.48","Blood makes you clothes white. Like that was one of my problems doing"],["1179.6","this um method dressing is I was very nervous I was going to spill on all this"],["1185.039","white. Uh I actually did not have my second cup of coffee, which I usually have in the car because I spill coffee a"],["1192.24","lot in the car. So I was like, I'll spill it all over myself. And uh so my nephew was sitting beside me during"],["1198.32","communion and he took his communion cup and he started leaning it towards me like, \"Oh, funny boy.\" You know, cuz if"],["1206.16","you spill on this, it's going to everybody's going to see that. But um only blood can wash away sin."],["1215.12","Only blood can wash away sin. What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus."],["1221.919","And that's the spot, the blemish that Peter's talking about, our sins. And"],["1227.28","without to be without spot is to live by faith in Jesus reflecting reflected in a"],["1233.919","life of obedience. And that's what revelations talks about there. It's why when we are baptized, we"],["1242.08","have people wear remember last week, what was co Kobe wearing? The white robe, right? And it's it's method"],["1249.039","dressing. The entire ceremony is acting out in the physical realm what has"],["1254.88","transpired in the spiritual realm. Sometimes the children uh when they want to get baptized they they'll I interview"],["1261.12","everybody and the kids think that well once I get baptized I will be saved. That is going to you know pastor Rob"],["1266.72","dunking them somehow is the step of getting saved. So I have to explain to them no it's it's like a play. You're"],["1273.12","acting out what happened when you prayed and asked Jesus to forgive you of your sins when you did that. Here's what"],["1279.679","happened. The the water symbolizes the washing, right? So every all over the"],["1285.919","world, that's what everybody uses water for. It's universal washing. So cleansing. Going down into the water is"],["1292.08","the imagery of dying to yourself. Rising up out of the water is the imagery of"],["1298.559","born again. And the clothes clothed in the white robes is the being cleansed"],["1303.6","from our sins. So, Revelation chapter 19, let us rejoice and be glad. It says,"],["1309.52","\"For the marriage supper of the lamb has come. The bride has made herself ready.\" How did she make herself ready? By the"],["1316.799","fine linen, bright and pure, was given to her to wear. So, the bride is the"],["1322.08","church. That's us. And we are to wear white to the wedding. A white A bride"],["1329.52","wearing white is very symbolic. It says, \"I'm a I'm a virgin. I've been faithful"],["1334.799","to wait for the bridegroom. Faithful and devoted. And that's what Peter is"],["1340.72","challenging us to be. To be without spot is to be clothed in Christ, prepared for"],["1346.559","the eternal celebration where the bridegroom and the bride, heaven and"],["1352.4","earth unite and come together. And that is the application of the information."],["1360.08","That's how we ought to be. So, what does that mean for you personally?"],["1366.24","Does that mean, you know, you wear white clothes every day and spill coffee on"],["1371.52","them? No. He says in verse 14, \"With all diligence, you're intentionally doing"],["1377.28","things with all diligence that develop these behaviors in your daily life.\" He"],["1383.6","says, \"With all with all diligence to be found in him at peace, without spot, and"],["1389.12","blameless.\" So there's actions that lead to destruction, right? We know this. We know Paul says in Galatians chapter 5,"],["1395.44","the works of the flesh, they're evident. Adultery, fornication, uncleanliness, lwdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred,"],["1401.679","contention, jealousy, outburst of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness,"],["1408.08","rebelling, and that I tell you beforehand, just as I told you in the time pass, that those who practice such"],["1413.84","things don't inherit the kingdom of God. If you're selfish and screaming and hollering to get your way, lying or"],["1420.799","hating or cursing people, being sexually inappropriate, all these things that Paul lists here, these are the actions"],["1428","that would communicate you're not interested in godliness or holy conduct."],["1433.2","I don't care about me having my sins washed away. Matter of fact, I'm all about my uncleanliness as you do those"],["1440.24","things. Just as there are actions that lead to destruction, there are actions that produce godliness in us. And that"],["1448.64","was the information that Peter gave us in the first chapter, which I know you remember from a couple weeks ago, cuz"],["1454.32","you remember everything I say. Chapter 1 verse 5. He says, \"For this reason, give"],["1459.84","all diligence to add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge self-control. Self-control,"],["1466.559","perseverance, perseverance, godliness, godliness, brotherly kindness, and brotherly kindness. add love."],["1473.44","So these behavior patterns that you keep adding to you starts with faith starts"],["1479.84","with prayer, confessing your sins as opposed to being proud. You humble yourself and then you take the"],["1486.64","knowledge, you take the instruction, that means you learn what God says and you obey it. If the Bible says love your"],["1494","neighbor, you love your neighbor. If the Bible says obey your parents, you obey your"],["1501.039","parents. Right? If it says speak the truth, you speak the truth. It says forgive those that hurt you, you're to"],["1506.96","forgive, right? The things that uh it says to do, you do. And it really helps"],["1512.24","to be around people who are likewise doing these things. Uh Paul warns in the"],["1517.52","Galatians, you know, all these things you shouldn't do, you know, like drunkenness. You you don't want to be a drunker. then you probably shouldn't be"],["1523.52","hanging around people that are encouraging you to drink all the time or or get high or or practice any level of"],["1529.12","wickedness or glorify wickedness. You know, you you got to step away. And that that is the hard part, isn't it? Putting"],["1536.72","pulling away from the allure of this world, the things that draw us in and the people the people that also draw us"],["1544.72","in. We have to separate ourselves from the actions of the people who try to persuade us to these destructive"],["1550.32","behaviors. And we have to stop the bad behavior and then we have to replace it with the good"],["1556.4","behavior. Right? Uh disassociate with those who mock God's word, fellowship"],["1561.76","with those who want to fellowship, worship, serve, people who want to grow."],["1569.039","Back in the 90s, um as a youth pastor, the the big thing that was blowing up"],["1574.08","was that goth scene. You remember the goss scene where kids wore jeans that were the size of a tent and uh eyeliner"],["1580.96","and there was the guys and all the all the craziness, all the black and uh Marilyn Manson and his antichrist"],["1588.32","rhetoric. It was all very popular in the music and and you know me, I love music and I love incorporating songs into my"],["1594.48","sermons. But as a youth pastor, I was like, man, I got to set a good example. Look what's craziness is going on out here and I I can't be listening to music"],["1601.76","that, you know, it mocks God. So, I I got to find some good Christian music. But that wasn't easy because this was"],["1608.559","before the internet, right? You just And we didn't have any Christian radio stations in our little town. So, I had"],["1615.2","to go to to a Christian bookstore and uh listen to the music that was there, sample it, and you know, buy some"],["1622.159","cassettes because yeah, we didn't even I mean, our car was so old it didn't even have a CD"],["1628.159","player. So, I had to find cassettes. Fortunately, they still sold them. And the kids, they'd never heard this music"],["1634","before, but I'd play it and I'd sing it because, you know, I like to sing loud"],["1640.159","and off key and and uh you know, they learn it, you know. So DC Talk brought out Jesus Freak in that time. I was a"],["1647.039","great album. You go listen to it 30 years ago. That album still holds up. And at first they thought I was weird."],["1653.6","But I influenced them. You know, I I gave them an alternative. Kids, we're going to play basketball and we're going to scream Jesus freak in the car and"],["1659.679","we're going to do Bible studies. that's that's what we're going to do. And so, you know, some of them, they made it through their adolescence and they stuck"],["1665.919","with their faith, but not all of them did. Two of the teens that walked away from church and God, you know, and we,"],["1672.48","you know, you hear through the grape vine, through social media, you know, they that two of them were murdered at"],["1677.76","different times and and one one girl by her drug dealer killed her. And uh I"],["1683.039","still think about those kids and and I think about some who grew up here and you know we we know some of them are in"],["1689.12","jail that were part of this ministry. And uh when we talk about sin being destructive, Peter uh was not just being"],["1697.279","overly dramatic, was he? It really is destruction to get involved in these"],["1703.919","things. So let's wrap it up here. of verse number 14,"],["1710.399","he says, \"Looking forward to these things, be diligent, be found in peace without spot or blameless. Consider all"],["1716.64","the longsuffering of our Lord. The longsuffering of our Lord is salvation."],["1722.24","As also our brother Paul according to the wisdom given to him has written to you.\" So he's quoting Paul here and he"],["1729.279","says as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some hard things to understand"],["1736.24","which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction as they do also"],["1741.36","the rest of scripture. So he's saying you know Paul spoke on these things and and and I was like did he did he speak"],["1748.399","on uh the longsuffering of our Lord and Savior? So yeah, you know, I had to look that up. And yeah, several times Paul"],["1754.48","spoke about that. And here's just one instance in Romans chapter 2 where Paul says, \"Do you despise the riches of his"],["1761.6","goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to"],["1767.84","repentance?\" So Paul emphasized that God's patience is meant to lead people"],["1773.12","to repentance. And I I rem that was one example where Paul and Peter were saying"],["1778.399","the same thing where they were both talking about the longsuffering. And then you remember in in chapter 3:9"],["1784.72","where Peter said, \"The Lord is not slack concerning his promises, but he is"],["1790.159","longsuffering towards us, not willing that any should perish, but all to come to repentance.\" So Paul emphasizes that"],["1797.84","God's patience is meant to lead people to repentance, which is uh the gateway to salvation. And I thought it was just"],["1805.039","kind of cool that uh Paul and Peter were reading each other's letters and uh"],["1810.48","Peter's agreeing with what Paul wrote. And I thought, well, you know, that would be that would be interesting because that was nowadays. We'd just"],["1816.24","invite them all to a big conference, wouldn't we? If you could have Peter and Paul and and maybe the Apostle John and"],["1822.32","have a an apostolic conference and then Pastor Mark would lead worship and that would be the big four right there. You"],["1827.919","know, that would be the best conference ever. you get him up here singing and and um but they were dealing with the"],["1834.399","same issues uh with trusting God, patience, but then also false teachers."],["1842.24","Did you did you catch that in verse 16? He said, \"As also in all his epistles, speaking to them of these things in"],["1848.64","which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destructions,"],["1854.88","that they do also the rest of the scriptures.\" So Peter and Paul were"],["1861.2","dealing with false teachers. Paul po Paul had warned the church of Ephesus after I depart. Savage wolves will come"],["1867.279","in among you not sparing the flock. Also from among yourselves men will arise"],["1872.32","speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after themselves. So that was an ongoing issue with the false"],["1878.64","teachers. All right let's go two more verses and then we will we'll cap it off. So verse 17. Therefore, beloved,"],["1886.88","since you know this beforehand, beware lest you fall from your own"],["1892.159","steadfastness, being led away with the air of the wicked, but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior"],["1898.96","Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. So, these two verses, they"],["1904.64","summarize the whole letter. Peter comes right back around to where he started. Grow in grace and knowledge. And that's"],["1912.88","why we come keep coming to church, right? keep coming to church to learn and to grow. And it's not easy to stay"],["1920.72","faithful. Many of us this week, we failed. We We didn't live sinfree. We're"],["1926.96","not spotless. We're not pure. I'm just method dressing. I I'm not really very"],["1933.36","pure. It's just white clothes. That's all it is. Uh but yet we come anyways because we know God loves us and Jesus"],["1941.44","saves us. So we come asking for forgiveness. We come asking for renewal."],["1948.24","Every time we do, we grow in grace. We practice our faith. So Peter, who gives"],["1953.84","us good reasons to be looking for Jesus. And while we're looking for Jesus, he instructs us that we ought to be looking"],["1960.72","like Jesus. Maybe you don't feel like you look the part. Well, neither do I."],["1967.76","I just dressed in white. I didn't actually live up to it. But the good thing is is we can pray and we can ask"],["1974.88","to be cleansed. We can be washed with the precious blood of Jesus. And before we go into communion, we can just bow"],["1981.279","our heads. Let's do that together, shall we? Just bow our head and close our eyes and let's look to the Lord and uh ask to"],["1988.399","be cleansed from our sins. Lord Jesus, we just pray now that you would uh wash"],["1995.12","us of our sins. anything that we've done this week that was uh"],["2000.159","similar to that list that Paul gave us of the works of the flesh and we know"],["2005.6","Holy Spirit you tell us what we've done where we failed so we ask for you to forgive us we ask for you to cleanse us"],["2012.24","uh we believe Jesus you died on the cross your blood was shed your body was broken to pay the price of all this so"],["2019.12","we just pray for that healing for each and everyone and maybe somebody for the first time would pray that prayer asking"],["2024.64","you for forgiveness Lord We just celebrate with them. We thank you and we pray for all of us who continually, it"],["2032","seems like daily, Lord, we come to you be asking to be forgiven. Please forgive us yet again and please help us to grow"],["2038.64","in this knowledge and grow in this way of living spotless until you come."],["2044.48","Praying in Jesus name. Amen."]]}]
