"],["26.16","this evening if you have your copy of "],["27.599","the word of God "],["29.58","Matthew chapter 16 "],["31.859","verse 21. "],["34.28","Jesus from that time began to show his "],["37.739","disciples that he must go to Jerusalem "],["39.719","suffer many things from the elders the "],["41.82","chief prescribes and be killed and be "],["44.94","raised up on the third day "],["47.76","Peter took him aside and began to rebuke "],["49.98","him saying God forbid it Lord this shall "],["53.82","never happen to you "],["55.379","but he turned and he said to Peter "],["57.539","get behind me Satan "],["59.76","you are a stumbling block to me "],["62.28","for you are not setting your mind on "],["65.22","God's interest but Mance "],["69.6","after an election we've seen this trend "],["72.119","of people rejecting the leadership that "],["74.04","gets voted in they they refuse to use "],["76.86","the formal title Mr President referring "],["79.02","to the individual and recently hashtag "],["81.9","not my president became a way for people "],["84.659","to identify themselves on social media "],["86.7","mostly this is because people don't "],["89.1","agree what with what the person stands "],["92.04","for what the president plans to do but "],["94.56","this is not a new phenomena "],["97.2","one of the most dangerous jobs in "],["99.18","America is being the head of state "],["102.18","four presidents were assassinated two "],["104.7","were wounded in attempts and 15 "],["107.28","presidents has had attempts on their "],["109.32","lives "],["110.159","when people don't get who they want as a "],["112.799","leader or they don't get what they want "],["114.96","from the leader they can get very upset "],["118.32","and this was a big part of the drama "],["121.2","around the life and Ministry of Jesus we "],["124.259","saw in John chapter 6 after the feeding "],["128.52","of the five thousand Jesus had to "],["131.16","retreat from the crowd John writes "],["133.86","therefore when the people saw the sign "],["135.599","which he had performed they said this is "],["137.94","truly the prophet who has come into the "],["140.28","world so Jesus perceived that they were "],["143.459","intending to come and take him by force "],["145.739","and make him King withdrew again to the "],["149.04","mountain by himself alone they would "],["152.22","force him to be king well "],["154.739","wasn't he supposed to be king wasn't he "],["157.62","the chosen one the Messiah well yes but "],["160.379","their concept of what the Messiah was to "],["163.26","do and what Jesus actually came to do "],["166.26","was two different things and this wasn't "],["169.319","just the case with the general "],["170.7","population this was even true of the "],["173.76","disciples Matthew chapter 16 now when "],["177.18","Jesus said verse 13 says Jesus came into "],["180.48","the District of caesarea Philippine "],["182.54","asking his disciples who do the people "],["184.739","say that the son of man is and he they "],["187.26","said well some say you're John the "],["189.18","Baptist and others Elijah and still "],["190.98","Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he "],["192.9","said but who do you say that I am "],["195.42","and Peter answered you are the Christ "],["198.019","the son of the Living God and Jesus said "],["201.3","to him blessed are you Simon bar Jonah "],["203.64","because Flesh and Blood did not reveal "],["205.68","this to you but my father who is in "],["207.42","heaven I also say to you you are Peter "],["210.06","and Upon This Rock I will build my "],["211.98","church and the Gates of Hell will not "],["213.9","overthrow it overpower it I will give "],["217.14","you the keys of the kingdom of heaven "],["219.9","and whatever you bind onto Earth "],["222.659","have been bound in shall have been bound "],["225.12","in heaven and whatever you loose on "],["227.159","Earth shall have been loosed in heaven "],["229.86","and he warned his disciples that they "],["232.62","should tell no one that he was the "],["234.18","Christ "],["236.7","then we see this whole thing of Jesus "],["238.879","telling them that he's going to go to "],["240.9","Jerusalem "],["242.099","and Jesus pulling Peter pulling Jesus "],["245.28","aside and saying God forbid it Lord that "],["248.28","they would "],["249.18","crucify you "],["250.98","and Jesus then saying get behind me "],["253.68","Satan you're a stumbling block "],["255.9","you're not setting your mind on God's "],["258.479","interest but man's "],["260.519","Jesus said to his disciples verse 24 if "],["262.8","anyone wishes to come after me he must "],["264.66","deny himself "],["266.16","take up his cross and follow me for "],["268.199","whoever wishes to save his life will "],["270.36","lose its and whoever loses his life for "],["273.479","my sake will find it what does it profit "],["276.12","a man if he gains the whole world and "],["278.04","forfeits his soul "],["279.84","or what will a man give in exchange for "],["282.36","his soul "],["283.56","for the son of man is going to come in "],["286.08","the glory of his father with his angels "],["288.3","and will then repay every man according "],["291.12","to

queen of grief and like one "],["564.839","whom men hide their face he was despised "],["568.5","and we did not esteem him "],["571.019","surely our griefs he himself bore in our "],["575.339","sorrows he carried yet we "],["577.5","ourselves esteemed him stricken smitten "],["579.839","of God and Afflicted he was pierced for "],["582.36","our transgressions he was crushed for "],["584.279","our iniquities the chastisement for all "],["586.26","of our peace fell upon him and by his "],["589.14","stripes we were healed all we like "],["590.519","streets sheep have gone astray each has "],["593.04","turned everyone to his own way and the "],["594.54","Lord has caused the iniquity of us all "],["596.16","to fall on him he was oppressed and he "],["598.74","was afflicted yet he opened not his "],["600.72","mouth "],["601.8","like a sheep that has led to the "],["603.72","slaughter the sheep that is silent "],["605.88","before its shears he did not open his "],["608.1","mouth "],["608.94","by oppression and judgment he was taken "],["611.1","away and as for the his generation who "],["614.1","considered that he shall be cut off out "],["616.62","of the land of the living for the "],["618.36","transgression of my people to whom the "],["620.16","stroke was due his grave was assigned "],["622.74","with wicked men yet he was with a rich "],["625.56","man in his death because he had done no "],["628.14","violence nor was there any deceit in his "],["630.54","mouth but the Lord was pleased to crush "],["632.58","him "],["633.36","putting him to grief if he would render "],["636.24","himself as a guilt offering he will see "],["639.48","his offspring he will prolong his days "],["642.18","the good pleasure of the

"],["660.24","booty with the strong because he poured "],["662.339","out himself to death "],["664.92","and was numbered with the transgressors "],["666.899","yet he himself bore the sin of many "],["669.72","and interceded for the transgressors "],["672.6","Jesus knew Isaiah 53 "],["676.2","disciples weren't thinking about Isaiah "],["678.18","53 "],["679.62","that's what the Messiah does "],["682.86","but Peter's like hashtag not my Messiah "],["685.86","that's not what I want my Messiah to do "],["688.44","Peter took him aside "],["690.54","God forbid it Lord this shall never "],["693.24","happen to you "],["694.86","it's not his vision of the Messiah not "],["696.48","what he signed up for and I think that's "],["697.74","how all the disciples found and Peter as "],["700.62","always was the one who dared voice it he "],["704.399","definitely was saying What Judas felt "],["707.7","Judas took Jesus very seriously he so "],["710.579","he's going to get killed and I need to "],["712.8","formulate an exit strategy so he "],["715.62","concocted a silver parachute he could "],["718.8","land on his feet when the time came "],["721.98","Judas wasn't going to suffer and die he "],["724.56","had to survive how did that work out for "],["726.12","him "],["727.62","not that good "],["729.54","so this is not news that the disciples "],["731.7","want to hear this was not their vision "],["733.5","of the Messiah we got all this power "],["735.959","from heaven and now you're going to die "],["738.899","Peter says forget it "],["741.18","God forbid it it's very telling "],["744.36","expression "],["745.44","Peter declares God forbid it when in "],["747.48","reality godhead "],["750.06","ordained it "],["751.86","so I wonder how often do we say God "],["755.16","forbid it "],["756.6","to things that God has actually ordained "],["760.26","do we think talk and act like we know "],["763.019","what God has planned when it's not "],["766.019","really God's plans it's our plans "],["769.32","we talk about what God wants when in "],["771.42","fact it's what we want "],["773.22","I'm mindful of this tendency disposition "],["778.079","especially being a pastor it's so easy "],["781.92","to Veer from what actually God is saying "],["784.98","into what I think God ought to be saying "],["787.92","pastors do this all the time don't they "],["790.019","we often see our ministry's ideas "],["792.18","programs and Visions as the will of God "],["794.88","they may be good ideas they may even be "],["797.339","practical ways to apply God's word but I "],["800.04","can't say God said we should send out a "],["804","summer missions trip God said we should "],["806.76","host come to the table conference God "],["809.459","said we should have Awana Ministry God "],["812.459","didn't say any of that "],["814.44","God said Go Make Disciples of all people "],["816.6","and these programs could be good ways to "],["819.12","assist us so we think they're worth "],["821.459","trying you know who wants to give it a "],["823.56","go "],["825.06","that's that's not as urgent and "],["827.339","authoritative as God Wills us "],["830.639","God wants us "],["833.16","when I can pull out the keys to the "],["836.22","kingdom of heaven and unlock things that "],["838.8","I want here on Earth "],["841.26","it sounds so much more imperative that "],["842.94","you listen to me "],["844.56","but I'm well aware of my corruptable "],["847.56","nature I don't completely trust me and I "],["850.8","I don't think you should either because "],["853.139","I'm not God "],["854.459","and thus I ought not speak as if I "],["857.459","know 100 percent what God forbid and God "],["860.94","desires "],["862.74","see all men all people have interest "],["865.639","first and foremost we have our own "],["868.38","interest in mind and God is interest our "],["871.16","secondary third fourth fifth "],["874.86","compared to our interests "],["877.38","see turns to Peter "],["879.959","and says Get Behind Me Satan "],["882.6","you're a stumbling block to me you're "],["884.82","are not setting your mind on God answers "],["887.399","but on man's "],["890.399","well Peter has his own interests and I "],["892.199","have my own interests and you have your "],["894.06","own interests and since you're here "],["895.98","today I would assume that in some way "],["898.44","our interests align I wanted to be here "],["901.26","to reflect on the sacrifice of Jesus "],["903.66","Christ and practice my faith in these "],["906.12","doctrines and probably you're here for "],["907.92","the same reason and there are several "],["910.139","things that we do here that are interest "],["913.139","align but I'm pretty sure you don't "],["915.06","agree with me on All My Views and you "],["917.279","don't approve of all my interest and "],["918.779","vice versa "],["920.04","hopefully we can be wise and patient and "],["922.26","loving enough to recognize what is worth "],["924.66","uniting over and what is worth not "],["926.94","fighting over "],["928.5","we don't have to agree on everything but "],["930.48","then there are God's interests God's "],["933","interests are not views they're not "],["935.579","suggestions God's interests are the "],["938.16","things that God is planning to do and "],["941.1","when we oppose them when we are adverse "],["944.16","to them we become adversarial which "],["947.88","happens to be what the Greek word title "],["950.399","Satan literally means adversary this is "],["954.42","why Jesus called Peter Satan when Peter "],["957.12","declared God forbidded that you die "],["959.639","Jesus he was being an adversary to the "],["962.88","interests of God "],["965.16","well how quickly things changed blessed "],["968.399","are you Peter here's the keys to the "],["970.079","kingdom two minutes ago "],["971.82","and now get behind me Satan "],["974.639","and that's why people in Authority good "],["978.18","people pastors parents people we love "],["982.139","can never be completely trusted like "],["984.54","Peter we too can deviate away from the "],["987.66","interests of God to our own interests "],["989.399","just that quickly "],["991.5","Peter's interest was having the Messiah "],["994.139","give him power and him ruling God's "],["996.959","interest was what "],["998.459","sacrificing his own son to die for the "],["1001.04","sins of all of mankind and all who "],["1003.139","believe by faith and the death of Jesus "],["1005.42","all who accept the gift of God would be "],["1007.88","forgiven of their sins and when Herod "],["1009.92","eternal life so Peter needed to not "],["1012.5","forbid the death of the Messiah but "],["1015.259","believe it is the way to Salvation and "],["1018.199","everlasting life "],["1019.639","and then the interest of God is for "],["1023.36","Peter and for all who believe in Jesus "],["1025.52","to take that message out and share it "],["1027.439","with the whole world "],["1028.579","this is the gift of God God gave this "],["1030.799","gift to me and he wants me to give it to "],["1032.78","you "],["1033.5","the interest of God is to build the "],["1036.02","kingdom One Soul one heart one life at a "],["1039.86","time which means everyone has to hear "],["1042.079","everyone has to have the message "],["1044.54","explained to them "],["1047","now I don't know about you but I I could "],["1048.919","be a little thick I don't necessarily "],["1050.78","understand new information the first "],["1052.52","time I get it generally I have to be "],["1055.4","told it and then I "],["1057.08","my pattern is I ignore the instructions "],["1059.539","and then mess things up and I get it "],["1061.16","wrong and then I'm retold the "],["1062.36","instructions and I revisit the "],["1063.74","information and then I try "],["1067.34","thus most of my Ikea furniture is done "],["1070.1","wrong "],["1072.44","so it takes me hearing things a few "],["1074.419","times before it sinks in I've noticed "],["1076.34","I'm not the only one who learns this way "],["1078.679","so it takes someone hearing about Jesus "],["1082.1","a few times "],["1083.539","it takes repetition which is why "],["1086.059","annually having a season where we "],["1088.28","reflect on the death of Jesus is a good "],["1090.14","thing after all it was the plan of God 4 "],["1093.2","000 years "],["1094.88","before it happens and then it was the "],["1097.22","most Pinnacle Point in human history and "],["1099.919","in an annual anniversary dates in April "],["1103.82","is very appropriate "],["1105.44","but it's not just for one day of the "],["1108.38","year now is it "],["1109.88","God's interest is for all to follow "],["1112.34","Christ

"],["350.06","and uh he doesn't want to disgrace Mary "],["353.58","so that was my first point let's try not "],["356.639","to disgrace anyone right according to "],["358.86","the law of Moses

"],["387.539","says she should "],["389.28","she should die but Joseph doesn't want "],["391.919","anyone to die he just doesn't want to be "],["394.919","married to someone who's been unfaithful

"],["2328.66","chance to get home and be with the "],["2330.04","family and they wanted me there for that "],["2331.96","at least that break but every other long "],["2334.42","weekend every other

"],["2383.02","never got home "],["2384.28","they never got home they just lived in "],["2387.099","the dorm all year long all holidays and "],["2389.8","when the cafeteria shut down they just "],["2391.96","cooked with a microwave in a hot pot in "],["2395.2","a in a hot plate and they they lived "],["2397.78","there all summer long "],["2399.099","and every bit alone on a special "],["2402.579","occasion "],["2403.78","or or something uh is kind of important "],["2407.26","to you is is happening but then nobody "],["2409.78","shows up to support you "],["2412.119","I think

"],["2423.06","mother-in-law or Mom or grandparents "],["2426.599","and then here it is the king of kings "],["2429.66","God's son just born into poverty into a "],["2434.98","harsh world and we know there was this "],["2437.26","whole upheaval of the whole world "],["2438.64","because of this sensitive taken by the "],["2440.5","Roman Overlord so you know the "],["2443.02","government of course is making things "],["2444.22","worse and as they always do and they had "],["2447.04","to travel there alone "],["2448.9","the world can be a harsh and lonely "],["2452.74","place "],["2453.7","and not everyone had a family to be with "],["2456.64","during the holidays or maybe "],["2460.42","some of our family doesn't want to be "],["2462.82","around us for the holidays and that's a "],["2465.579","hard thing with some of the "],["2467.32","dynamics of family and there's times "],["2470.74","when nobody shows up "],["2473.56","and maybe you'll lost someone "],["2476.32","it was very important to you and and "],["2478.42","they're not going to be there for the "],["2480.94","holidays for the first time "],["2483.339","but "],["2485.14","Jesus knows all about that "],["2488.5","and Jesus gives us this promise "],["2491.079","he says I will never "],["2494.26","leave you or "],["2496.42","forsake you "],["2498.82","whenever I had a "],["2501.94","time when I was feeling lonely or even "],["2504.4","now where I just feel like you can't "],["2505.78","quite "],["2507.52","collect my thoughts and get through to "],["2509.98","what I want I need to talk about it is "],["2512.5","sure nice to know that Jesus is always "],["2514.839","with you and he's always someone you "],["2517.18","could talk to someone who sticks with "],["2519.579","you sticks closer than a brother "],["2522.339","I think Christmas Eve service is "],["2524.38","symbolic it's a symbolic way for us to "],["2527.74","say to Jesus "],["2529.24","you guys were all alone on that night "],["2532.48","but now we're all here "],["2535.18","and we're all here to celebrate your "],["2536.98","birthday Jesus "],["2538.66","so "],["2540.04","we know that uh he's always with us "],["2544.119","and may we live our lives to show him "],["2546.82","that we're always with him and he's in "],["2550.3","here with us "],["2552.339","so if you're here tonight and maybe you "],["2553.96","feel kind of alone because people you "],["2555.64","love can't be here or don't want to be "],["2557.26","here or you have nobody to be with well "],["2561.16","Jesus is here "],["2562.9","and he's with you "],["2564.7","and we're here for him "],["2567.46","and he's here for us too so "],["2570.339","hang on to that hope and that promise "],["2572.26","and maybe share that into a cold hard "],["2576.579","world "],["2577.599","reminding people that look around see "],["2580.599","somebody that maybe needs someone let "],["2582.7","them know that you know Jesus loves them "],["2585.64","God loves them and and you can love them "],["2588.04","as well "],["2589.24","so a little thought for you tonight "],["2590.92","let's uh let's close up and then we'll

"],["161.44","and i'm like you guys are tiresome "],["166.64","but i couldn't wait for the weekends "],["168.08","because that's when i would hang out my "],["169.44","friends "],["170","and do all the things that i had wanted "],["172.48","to do "],["173.28","with my life but "],["176.72","i was missing a very important sign and "],["179.68","the sign was "],["180.72","that my sister's life was a wreck my "],["183.84","other sister's life was headed "],["185.599","for a wreck my cousins who were all "],["188.4","doing the same thing "],["189.92","all of our lives were headed for a "],["193.04","terrible "],["193.68","ending and as it says it's said "],["196.879","dead end stupid and i didn't get that "],["203.04","i didn't get it at all but then "],["206.319","one night "],["210.959","i'm feeling all caged up "],["214.159","and my friend invites me to this meeting "],["218.08","and i don't really want to go i even "],["220.319","make the mis "],["222.08","statement i can't go and "],["225.12","it was true my parents said i've been "],["226.879","away from home too much "],["228.56","and they just want me home this week "],["231.84","it's on a wednesday night and this "],["233.04","evangelist had been preaching in chapel "],["234.879","and i really didn't like him "],["236.4","because he made me feel uncomfortable "],["239.599","about the way i was living and other "],["242","things in that "],["243.599","this jesus thing "],["247.439","but he kept insisting that i come and i "],["251.04","said well my parents won't let me and he "],["252.799","said well "],["253.439","i already called your parents and "],["254.959","they're coming tonight "],["258.32","you jerk "],["262.479","so we go that night and this guy dr "],["265.199","david anderson evangelist dr david "],["267.36","sanders and he starts preaching "],["269.04","and he says we're all born in this river "],["270.96","of life and "],["272.479","as we go down this river of life it's as "],["274.88","natural for us to go down this river as "],["276.8","it is for us to breathe "],["279.84","but the end of this river of life "],["284.16","is eternal life without god "],["287.44","in hell but god in his love puts "],["291.44","these log jams in your life and i'm like "],["295.12","okay i'm interested "],["298.88","he might put a log jam of a parent "],["301.919","especially a father getting right with "],["303.68","god and starting to read the bible "],["305.919","together as a family "],["308.88","who that happened "],["311.919","it might be a tv evangelist speaking "],["314.08","that might get your attention "],["315.919","the only reason i was at a christian "],["317.52","school is because my dad turned off the "],["319.039","james bond movie on a sunday night "],["321.28","and there was this christian school hour "],["323.039","the only night in the 32 years of the "],["324.8","program they talked about the christian "],["326.4","school "],["331.919","and i blurted out i'd like to go there "],["334.08","my dad got so excited i couldn't say i "],["336.32","was kidding "],["338.5","[Applause] "],["341.28","so i end up going to this christian "],["343.28","school "],["344.96","and then he says the next law jimmy "],["346.479","might be a friend "],["348.08","who got right with god and invited you "],["350.639","here tonight "],["352","so that was ed at pyle we had been "],["354.479","partying the year before "],["356","he was two years older and we would get "],["358","away from the school "],["359.36","part way home because that's whose house "],["360.96","i would stay at and we would you know do "],["363.12","all the stuff that "],["365.28","you don't do when you're when you that "],["367.199","you do do when you are a christian "],["370","and i was so excited about all these "],["371.68","things and then "],["373.36","but realizing that all the wait god said "],["376.4","what "],["377.6","these are log jams in my life and ed "],["379.68","invited me this night "],["384.24","all of a sudden i realized that all "],["386.08","these circumstances i thought were "],["388.24","just randomly happening god was "],["391.52","orchestrating because he loved me "],["395.36","now i had heard john 3 16 a thousand "],["398.72","times by now "],["400","oh my gosh every single chapel speaker "],["403.36","had to somehow get to john 3 16. "],["406.479","and there's this evangelist he gets to "],["408.319","john 3 16 and he says "],["410","it's because for god so loved the world "],["413.36","and i was beginning to realize holy cow "],["418.08","that might include me and then he says "],["420.88","there's this last "],["422","log jam let me excuse me this last "],["425.12","sandbar "],["426.24","is you're going and there's three "],["428.16","crosses on the sandbar and there's jesus "],["430.4","at the sandbar "],["431.44","with his arms wide open waiting to "],["434.479","accept you because he loves you so much "],["437.28","he died on the cross for you "],["440.72","i was like holy cats "],["445.12","i'm gripping the seat at this point "],["450","and i turned to my friend ed and said ed "],["453.52","i want to go forward tonight and trust "],["455.44","christ as my savior "],["458.479","and he was like huh i thought you were "],["463.36","nope but it was that night i realized "],["466.879","that jesus christ "],["468.319","loved me and it's that i want to briefly "],["470.879","talk to you about tonight "],["472.8","about that he died on the cross to pay "],["475.919","for our "],["476.72","sins it is just this incredible truth "],["480.72","now i want us to read together the "],["483.12","apostles creed there's a reason for this "],["484.96","we're going to "],["485.84","jam it all in here together real quick "],["488.56","the apostles creed was taught to "],["490.56","early believers remember they did not "],["492.319","have the bibles like we have today "],["494.8","they were like hey we need to make sure "],["496.479","people believe right things "],["498.16","do right things and have good "],["499.84","relationships so let's "],["502.319","teach them a creed is just a belief "],["504.56","statement "],["505.84","let's teach them the ten commandments "],["508.319","and let's "],["509.12","teach them the lord's prayer they had to "],["511.36","memorize these "],["513.2","so we're just going to read the apostles "],["515.919","creed "],["516.56","please read it with me i believe in god "],["520.32","the father almighty creator of heaven "],["522.88","and earth "],["523.68","i believe in jesus christ his only son "],["526.88","our lord who was conceived by the holy "],["529.6","spirit "],["530.24","and born of the virgin mary he suffered "],["532.959","under pontius pilate "],["534.64","he was crucified died and was buried he "],["537.76","descended to hell "],["539.2","the third day he rose again from the "],["541.2","dead he ascended to heaven "],["543.519","and is seated at the right hand of god "],["546","the father almighty "],["547.6","from there he will come to judge the "],["549.68","living and the dead "],["551.12","i believe in the

"],["561.44","everlasting "],["562.56","amen now we want to just focus on the "],["565.839","one part of this we want to focus on "],["567.44","jesus christ and what he did "],["569.92","so i believe in jesus christ his only "],["572.24","son our lord who is conceived by the "],["574","holy spirit "],["574.959","and born of the virgin mary galatians 4 "],["578.399","tells us "],["580","that when the fullness of time was to "],["581.6","come god sent "],["583.36","forth his son born of woman born "],["586.48","under the law so god in his miraculous "],["590.399","timing "],["591.04","which i was getting really familiar with "],["593.279","after all those "],["594.64","road log jams that i realized god had "],["597.279","orchestrated "],["598.72","when god says that he at the right time "],["602.16","at the perfect time sent jesus he means "],["605.12","he orchestrated everything from "],["607.68","beginning before time began to the "],["609.839","creation "],["610.72","that the this lamb was slain before the "],["612.88","foundation of the world he had "],["614.079","everything figured out and planned out "],["616.24","before anything started why because "],["619.44","god is a planner and he is a lover "],["623.839","and he planned to love us for all "],["626","eternity "],["627.04","and he said everything perfectly in "],["629.76","motion "],["630.64","i believe in jesus christ now this is "],["633.2","extremely important "],["634.48","because in acts 16 31 and the "],["638","philippian jailer says what must i do to "],["640.16","be saved and they said believe in the "],["642.16","lord jesus christ "],["643.44","and you will be saved and your household "],["647.279","i mean it impacts so many people "],["651.12","and we want to see his son his only son "],["653.68","our lord "],["654.48","oh this gets good "],["657.519","thomas you guys remember thomas thomas "],["661.2","jesus had appeared to the disciples "],["662.959","after the resurrection "],["664.399","and he's like man unless i see his side "],["667.12","put my hand "],["667.76","in it put my hand in the nail print in "],["669.92","his hands i'm not going to believe "],["671.76","and jesus shows up again with thomas "],["674.8","there "],["675.519","and he doesn't say thomas you doubt her "],["677.6","he goes hey thomas "],["679.04","come here put your hand right here "],["682.959","i loved you this much and i care for you "],["685.76","right now "],["686.88","i want you to believe touch it "],["691.36","this is what was pierced for you "],["694.64","and thomas immediately says what my lord "],["699.519","and my god jesus is lord he "],["703.04","is god but there was a big debate going "],["706.48","on "],["706.8","at the time that the apostle creed was "],["708.959","written and "],["710.88","a lot of people said jesus was "],["714","only man because god could never "],["717.92","come down and live the life that he "],["719.839","lived and die "],["721.519","and others said well he's only god "],["724.8","because only god could pay for all of "],["727.12","our sin "],["728.48","and god said hey watch this i got this "],["731.2","covered "],["733.12","and he's amazing because he does that "],["735.36","because jesus is "],["736.32","man and god he was conceived by the "],["741.839","when you're conceived by the holy spirit "],["744.079","you're "],["745.279","you're god and born of the virgin mary "],["748.959","oh you're also man "],["752.72","i love this now it says an angel came in "],["756.079","luke 1 31 "],["757.44","and behold the angel said to mary you "],["759.76","will conceive in your womb and bear son "],["762.24","and you shall call his name jesus he "],["764.639","will be great will be called

would be born with sin and he would "],["824","have to pay for his "],["825.839","own sin he had to also be "],["829.44","god because he could then be the perfect "],["833.44","sacrifice "],["834.639","but not only did he need to be god to "],["837.04","pay the perfect sacrifice "],["839.12","but only a god could pay an eternal "],["842.56","sacrifice that covers all sin
