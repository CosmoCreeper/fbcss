other Ministries why specifically are "],["1047.919","people pouring that out on this church "],["1049.679","well I think it's because we as a church "],["1052.52","are generous at redistributing "],["1055.72","it we had a request come to us from one "],["1058.96","of our missionaries that we support and "],["1062.039","they had this big project they asked for "],["1064.44","a gift at the end of the year over and "],["1065.88","above they said Can Can we can you guys "],["1068.679","help "],["1069.6","us how much is this "],["1072.72","$25,000 so well take that to the elders "],["1076.039","to the elders and uh we sat around "],["1078.52","talked about it and the elders decided "],["1082.4","God has been too generous with us to not "],["1085.32","give back that's the second time this "],["1087.72","year we've done that given a $25,000 "],["1090.12","gift to missionaries things outside of "],["1092.679","this church and those gifts are over and "],["1095.039","above what's budgeted the 110,000 "],["1097.76","120,000 that is budgeted in for next "],["1101.159","year when we announced that Keith and "],["1103.28","Judy were collecting

"],["86.34","to the gospel and anyone who claimed to "],["88.74","believe in Jesus would routinely be "],["90.72","rounded up and imprisoned or killed "],["92.46","missionaries would often come to

ought to pray for them "],["122.82","I didn't know any Chinese people or "],["125.759","missionaries but of all the missionary "],["128.88","cards in the Box I remember that one for

"],["151.739","wayside and even the box of prayer cards "],["155.04","eventually disappeared by Junior High "],["158.04","there was no longer a thing and I never "],["160.68","thought any more about

"],["174.54","keynote speaker was this Chinese man who "],["177.78","had been a missionary and planted "],["179.519","churches all over China and he was "],["182.04","telling all the stories of persecution "],["184.5","and trials and arrests and near-death "],["187.56","experiences but he also told us about "],["189.9","the explosive growth of the underground "],["192.36","church and despite all the persecution "],["194.819","and death the number of Christians in "],["196.98","China was innumerable "],["199.319","and at that conference the Holy Spirit "],["201.659","prompted my memory and

"],["214.319","generically for the church in China "],["217.86","it was exactly the time that that man "],["220.44","was on the mission field and all the "],["223.14","amazing work of the holy spirit

"],["233.7","and the Holy Spirit told me at that "],["235.26","conference this is who you are praying "],["237.72","for Rob "],["239.099","it was an aha moments for my faith and "],["243.299","understanding of the power of God and "],["246.36","the working of Prayer "],["248.94","you realize our God who we pray to is "],["253.22","transcended "],["254.9","omnipresent and

even try to "],["270.84","imagine it but in that conference I got "],["272.88","just a brief glimpse of how connected "],["275.28","things are things spoken of in one side "],["278.34","of the world

rusted I "],["43.19","learned to ride it and I was very happy "],["46.05","to ride it around with the big kids "],["47.879","because little kids had tricycles that "],["50.64","were slow and lame and you couldn't go "],["53.19","anyplace big kids rode bicycles and when "],["56.19","you had a bike you could go anywheres we "],["59.13","lived in the town of Truro Nova Scotia "],["60.66","my sister and I would ride our bikes a "],["63.57","couple of blocks to swimming lessons and "],["65.7","we would take the rider down to the "],["67.5","store and get a treat and when you had a "],["69.72","bike you had freedom was proof that you "],["72.54","were all grown up now you could take "],["74.19","care of yourself because you when she "],["76.229","went on a ride parrots kinda had to let "],["77.58","you go they didn't really know where you "],["78.57","were you were just riding all around the "],["80.009","community somewheres on your bike "],["81.96","so I never really thought too much about "],["84.57","the fact that my bike was a hand-me-down "],["86.64","girl's bike because if it wasn't for "],["88.71","that hand-me-down bike I wouldn't have "],["90.15","had any bike at all I did remember that "],["93.51","dad gave it a facelift he got a can of "],["95.159","black spray paint and he sprayed the "],["97.38","frame and was like oh I was like a "],["98.52","brand-new bike now Wow "],["100.14","I was good my grandmother had a neighbor "],["103.17","whose son was a year older than me and "],["105.869","once a year I would receive a couple of "],["107.58","bags of clothes that the kid had grown "],["111.18","out of and gave my grandmother and she "],["112.92","gave it to me and I remember being "],["114.689","always it's so excited to see what new "],["117.54","clothes I had got didn't really care "],["120.39","that they were hand-me-downs they were "],["122.34","new to me and I remember very "],["124.59","specifically one time this was when the "],["128.94","loire shirts and corduroys were in I "],["131.75","remember some of you don't have any clue "],["134.13","what a velour shirt is and some of you "],["135.6","were laughing because you're visualizing "],["137.459","me in a wide colorful or certain with "],["139.44","corduroys on right and that was good "],["141.51","because there was a whole bunch in that "],["142.89","bag and that was really cool so "],["147.37","some point as a kid I figured out that "],["149.62","we did not have a lot to work with I "],["152.92","didn't have a clue how much my dad "],["155.17","officially earned but it wasn't too "],["157.959","tough to figure out that it wasn't a "],["159.19","whole lot sometimes I was frustrated "],["161.47","when I knew I was gonna be told no we "],["163.9","can't afford that but all of my needs "],["166.269","were met and I was having a lot of fun "],["168.67","ride around on my little bicycle where "],["171.099","my corduroys so you know I wasn't too "],["174.25","vexed by what we didn't have looking "],["176.349","back and talking to my father and he "],["178","would explain to me now you know what "],["179.95","they were being paid and I think Wow not "],["182.319","a bit of wonder we lived the way we did "],["184.18","because we were poor but it doesn't make "],["187.69","me feel shame actually it kind of gives "],["190.15","me a sense of pride when I think of my "],["193.39","upbringing and I think of my stories one "],["195.7","day Ilyana was telling the boys stories "],["198.97","about when she was a little girl and "],["200.519","Eliana's mom has four sisters and since "],["203.47","she was the oldest and only "],["205.09","granddaughter she was you know the "],["209.049","chosen one she was the little dolly that "],["212.26","they all spoiled and they would buy her "],["215.709","clothes and she got the the newest trans "],["218.62","living in New York City having all the "],["220.72","latest fashions these these young "],["222.72","20-something women would buy her and "],["225.19","dress her up and she looked really cool "],["228.04","and then juxtaposed to her telling her "],["230.44","story about that I told the boys when I "],["233.92","was a little guy my favorite shirt was a "],["236.799","t-shirt that said tough stuff "],["239.109","and I loved to wear it because it made "],["241.329","me feel tough and I would wear it every "],["244.389","day and I would wear it with my shorts "],["246.91","and my rubber boots and I would go "],["249.4","outside and play every day in my tough "],["252.13","stuffed shirt in my rubber boots and "],["255.75","boys would look at me and they look at "],["260.2","their mother and then they just start "],["262.33","laughing hysterically at the picture "],["265.24","that we just drew in our two stories "],["268.24","here's this trendy city girl looking too "],["270.82","cute and then right beside that is this "],["273.46","little dirty ragamuffin boy with his "],["276.46","belly popping out of his too small pammi "],["279.969","down tough stuff sir "],["281.26","his rubber boots and it's comical but I "],["283.81","always tell my stories not with the "],["286.15","sense of embarrassment but rather with a "],["287.65","sense of pride I'm proud of where I come "],["290.8","from I grew up poor "],["292.78","I didn't always like it but it did "],["294.97","instill in me a sense of appreciation "],["297.31","and gratitude there's this prophecy in "],["301.15","2nd Timothy chapter 3 and you all just "],["304.12","said oh well the new book we're studying "],["306.4","is 2nd Timothy no this is a topical "],["309.25","sermon I have not decided where we're "],["311.56","going next I have an idea but I know "],["313.99","it's crazy pastor Robb never does "],["315.4","topical but today we're doing topical "],["317.86","for Thanksgiving but here's a vivid "],["320.44","description in 2nd Timothy chapter 3 "],["323.16","verse number 1 and you many you know "],["325.87","this passage because I've quoted it many "],["327.34","times before Paul says but realize this "],["329.83","in the last days difficult times will "],["332.71","come for men will be lovers of self "],["335.14","lovers of money boastful arrogant "],["337.57","revilers disobedient to parents

negative "],["364.38","description that's negative right so "],["367.81","doesn't sound like people are getting "],["369.61","better or advancing it doesn't sound "],["372.1","like and improving or superior culture "],["375.19","does it now sounds like society is going "],["377.71","to be degrading and I don't want to "],["380.62","cover all of it today I just want to "],["382.6","zoom in on one specific description they "],["387.1","will be ungrateful coming into the "],["391.57","Thanksgiving season I thought it would "],["393.37","be good for us to talk about "],["394.8","thankfulness and what it is and what "],["397.93","it's not and before I forget I just "],["400.06","wanted to report to the church that we "],["401.71","had over 243 shoeboxes delivered that is "],["406.42","twice as much as we did last year and "],["408.67","krystal thrown the gauntlet down to say "],["410.59","we can do more Church and well there you "],["412.45","go crystal well done "],["413.92","Faith Bible Church "],["415.72","so I want to talk about what "],["418.34","Thanksgiving is and what it is not the "],["420.92","opposite of being thankful is I'm "],["422.81","grateful "],["423.62","thankless unappreciative ungracious who "],["426.32","typically do we visualize when we think "],["428.24","of ungrateful people why are we thinking "],["431.57","of we think of rich kids right right "],["432.95","rich kids because they have a lot and "],["434.81","and the rich kid doesn't have to accept "],["436.76","the hand-me-down used bicycle or the "],["438.83","used clothes because he gets the new "],["440.9","stop the best stop he's got so much he "],["443.39","doesn't understand the value of anything "],["445.1","if you have only one pair of shoes "],["446.93","you're quite upset if you get them "],["448.67","wrecked or dirty but you tend to take "],["452.09","care of it if that's all you have but if "],["453.74","you have a bunch it doesn't matter if "],["455.24","you lose a wreck something because you "],["457.22","got plenty rich people are ungrateful "],["458.72","and poor people are so much more "],["460.46","grateful or so we assume but you know I "],["463.4","have met a lot of poor people who are "],["466.28","very ungrateful as well I've seen some "],["469.16","of the poorest people homeless people "],["470.51","complain about a free breakfast that you "],["472.82","made them and I like this breakfast why "],["474.62","can't we have this and I've seen people "],["476.84","go to care net to get free diapers and "],["479.18","then complain that that wasn't the brand "],["480.83","that they wanted this brand does not "],["482.84","satisfy them so I've seen poor people "],["485.83","receive new coats and boots for winter "],["489.14","and then just completely trash them "],["490.76","within two weeks likewise I've heard "],["493.22","people who have a great deal of "],["494.45","abundance say I'm so grateful and I'm so "],["496.82","thankful I've seen well-off people happy "],["499.04","to get a used item at a yard sale or "],["501.83","find something at a thrift store and be "],["504.08","so very pleased that they found this "],["505.49","great bargain so it's not accurate to "],["508.7","say people with abundance are ungrateful "],["511.01","and people would need our grateful "],["512.63","thankfulness is not a byproduct

about ladies in the "],["577.31","nursery right that would be a great "],["579.29","education on what human nature is "],["581.15","actually like you got a little dolly and "],["584.09","she's got her

"],["620.27","human nature is like there's an attitude "],["622.31","called "],["623.03","greed lust Envy and they're present in "],["627.53","the life of all rich or poor was it my "],["632.87","poor

"],["644.15","fact it is a choice that we have to make "],["647.39","to be thankful leviticus 22 in the law "],["649.76","when you offer a sacrifice of "],["651.8","Thanksgiving to the Lord

risk information and early "],["85.95","warning messages must be delivered that "],["87.78","makes sense and then response capability "],["90.21","systems should be in place to respond to "],["93.06","events I think we would all agree that "],["95.429","an early warning system is a good idea "],["98.99","something that can warn us is going to "],["102.24","help us avoid disaster and

Judah in Jeremiah chapter 43 "],["158.39","had the greatest early warning system of "],["161.3","all they had a prophet telling them "],["163.4","exactly what was going to happen what "],["166.61","was coming up in the future "],["168.2","they had risk knowledge they had a "],["171.77","warning system jeremiah acted as a means "],["174.8","of communication when he delivered the "],["176.75","warning to the leadership of the people "],["178.34","but here's where the system would break "],["180.23","down in step number four response "],["182.71","capability the challenge with the early "],["185.81","warning system is will people respond "],["188.54","appropriately based on the risk warning "],["192.35","and the dissemination of the message "],["193.79","what would the response be the other day "],["197.54","we were cooking something in the smoke "],["199.73","detector went off and my response to "],["201.92","that was to get a chair get up on it and "],["205.19","push the reset button right that was my "],["208.01","response to the warning and we were "],["210.2","sitting there a couple weeks back and we "],["212.81","got all sudden this beeping on our "],["214.31","phones and we looked at our phones and "],["215.6","it was a early warning system talking "],["217.43","about tornado you know high risk of "],["219.44","tornados coming through the area and to "],["221.78","which we went and shrugged her shoulders "],["223.73","and went back to watching our program so "],["227.45","our response was to shut it off and "],["229.459","ignore it now to our defense we knew the "],["232.91","house wasn't burning down a it was just "],["235.31","the chicken was getting a little bit "],["237.19","Cajun a little bit extra crispy there "],["240.23","and we you know pertaining to the "],["243.68","tornado what ought you do when a tornado "],["245.45","is coming stay home right stay inside so "],["248.42","we were already there I feel like we "],["250.28","responded appropriately if the house was "],["252.709","actually on fire and our response was to "],["255.41","turn the smoke detector off that would "],["257.269","be foolish and if we said you know hey "],["259.43","let's drive around and find the tornado "],["260.78","take pictures of it let's be tornado "],["262.55","hunters like that would be you know "],["264.8","dangerous and crazy so let's see what "],["267.59","the folks respond to the prophetic early "],["270.29","warning system here "],["272.18","in Jeremiah 43 and we're going to pick "],["274.85","it up in verse number 8 and then we're "],["276.38","gonna jump down a little bit into 44 "],["278.09","this morning but verse number 8 of "],["279.8","Jeremiah 43 says the word of the

at the entrance of "],["295.069","Pharaoh's Palace into Fannie's in the "],["297.589","sight of some of the Jews and say to "],["300.319","them thus says the Lord of hosts the God "],["302.209","of

"],["312.589","have hidden and he will spread his "],["314.779","canopy over them and he will also come "],["317.689","and strike the land of Egypt "],["319.309","those who are meant for death will be "],["321.11","given over to death and those for "],["322.819","captivity and those for the sword to the "],["325.369","sword and it shall be and I shall set "],["327.889","fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt "],["330.739","and he will burn them and take them "],["333.229","captive so he will wrap himself with the "],["336.259","land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps "],["338.839","himself with his garments and he will "],["340.729","depart from there safely "],["342.889","he will also shatter the awe bliss of "],["345.499","the Heliopolis which is in the land of "],["347.719","Egypt and the temples of the God of "],["350.479","Egypt he will burn with fire okay so "],["353.779","there's the warning the prophecy set "],["356.449","some stones you ever notice the Old "],["359.149","Testament Israel's always setting up "],["360.529","some stones why do they do that they set "],["364.639","them up to remember right as a "],["367.129","remembrance stones tend to stand the "],["370.669","test of time don't they use up some "],["372.529","stones they tend to be there for a long "],["374.479","time to come so much so the concept is "],["377.089","an expression that we use set in stone "],["381.739","right but policy set in stone "],["384.319","it means it's never going to change the "],["386.419","set in paper paper you know you can "],["388.909","shred it pretty easily would you can "],["391.219","light on fire you know metal does better "],["394.479","can last while you know things that "],["396.829","happen to metal here's a little inside "],["399.019","joke for you all from the McNab "],["401.179","household back in 2016 Tony totaled my "],["404.989","truck by skidding out in the rain and "],["407.209","hitting a traffic light pole on the "],["409.549","corner of Chancellor's running pay "],["411.019","growth still a little salty about it but "],["413.36","you know in doing so the truck bent a "],["417.139","metal access panel cover on the "],["420.19","whole to its side that open panel is our "],["424.99","memorial of that accidents and since "],["427.42","then we've been keeping our eye on it to "],["429.43","see how long that panel is gonna stay "],["431.17","been open so we're going on three years "],["433.57","now so you know not saying anything "],["436.15","about the county but it's last time we "],["438.25","checked it's still been open and there's "],["441.97","a country song that says we left our "],["443.83","mark on this town it's left our mark on "],["445.84","us and that's Tony's memorial that's his "],["448.81","mark that he left on peg wrote we we "],["452.08","think of it every time we see it bent "],["454.09","that Bank cover open metal last right "],["457.09","but eventually metal will even rust but "],["459.88","stone stone has staying power so all the "],["464.2","Jews in Egypt they see Jeremiah setting "],["466.93","up these stones and every time they go "],["469.87","by that Terrace and they look at those "],["471.43","stones they remember that prophecy and "],["474.01","if and when Nebuchadnezzar shows up and "],["477.1","sets up his throne there there will be "],["478.9","no denying the fact the message from God "],["481.93","where they were warned it was set in "],["485.08","stone no that's very interesting what if "],["488.29","it happen who knows there's a "],["493.39","inscription on a clay cylinder on "],["495.61","display in the British Museum with the "],["498.22","assigned museum number three three zero "],["500.05","four one

all of their "],["544.96","records all of their whatever they "],["547.18","wanted to save and then they would put "],["549.01","the clay tablets in the hot Sun and they "],["551.68","would break bake and then the "],["553.69","information "],["554.29","would then be set in stone and never "],["558.639","good Nezzer had posted his name in brick "],["561.459","all over that ancient city of Babylon

the Bible but a lot of "],["597.549","science proves that the Bible is very "],["600.189","accurate archeology is a science events "],["604.869","stated in Scripture that had been "],["607.209","written in stone and discovered by "],["609.069","scientists over and over again prove the "],["612.759","Bible to be true so the prophecy of "],["615.369","Jeremiah the warning he gave

"],["635.499","places we see that at the beginning of "],["637.809","chapter 44 where it lists the the Jews "],["640.569","in the land of Egypt and then even lists "],["642.369","the cities of McDole and Tiffany's "],["644.769","Memphis and Path Ross and often we read "],["648.16","these stories we need to take the time "],["649.629","to dig out a an atlas a Bible Atlas and "],["652.929","go through the maps and find out where "],["655.48","these places are located and often "],["657.579","you'll find that they're still there "],["658.629","today or when we study people's names we "],["661.48","should take some time to dig into who "],["662.98","these people were in history because "],["665.079","these names of people and places "],["668.309","likewise prove the biblical accounts are "],["671.139","accurate historical facts often when I'm "],["675.609","telling you stories about where I grew "],["677.949","up "],["678.159","I will even tell you about the names of "],["680.499","places and the names of people that I "],["683.139","grew up with and probably most of you "],["684.939","are never going to venture up the 95 all "],["688.089","way to Houlton Maine and cross over into "],["689.92","Carlton County New Brunswick and travel "],["692.019","up the st.

talk "],["707.829","about what year it was or what season it "],["709.839","was and all of these stories all of this "],["712.99","brings the story to life in your mind "],["715.6","and if you really were so motivated you "],["717.939","could just fact check it all couldn't "],["719.62","you you can get out your phone and go to "],["720.999","Google Maps and say let's follow the 95 "],["722.8","I know look it really does go all the "],["724.36","way up to the Canadian border and look "],["726.22","those names of those little towns are "],["727.569","right there here on my map in my hand "],["730.329","and it speaks to the authenticity if I "],["735.069","told you I was from Narnia or "],["738.85","Gondor or never Neverland you'd be "],["742.839","skeptical about any other detail I told "],["745.24","you about my upbringing wouldn't be like "],["747.279","oh well he knew orcs what what's wrong "],["749.199","with you see the accuracy on the facts "],["752.11","is evidence - the authenticity of the "],["754.48","message the accuracy of the facts is "],["758.079","evidence - the authenticity of the "],["760.12","message historical records of Jerusalem "],["762.839","falling right history records that that "],["765.79","that happened around 590 BC and then "],["768.309","these recordings of Egypt being "],["770.499","conquered by Nebuchadnezzar they're "],["772.12","written in the annals of history and all "],["774.1","these things that Jeremiah the Prophet "],["775.54","foretold would happen before they "],["778.149","happened all these things were warned - "],["782.019","the people were warned about as an "],["783.879","emergency warning system Jeremiah is "],["787.139","impeccably accurate see I'm belaboring "],["790.899","this point because it has an essential "],["793.269","application for all of us the fact that "],["795.999","the Bible prophecies given in advance of "],["798.639","the events are proven to be historic "],["801.329","story accurate ought to strengthen our "],["804.699","faith when you understand that that "],["807.55","these events we're told before they "],["810.37","happen and they've been proven

"],["1540.27","they just ignored and rejected God's "],["1543.12","revelations so it comes as no surprise "],["1546.36","to see people in our time embracing the "],["1549.24","darkness and calling the

"],["104.8","turn over there we'll get in the story "],["106.09","in a minute now remember that at this "],["108.19","time in history David is king by divine "],["111.97","decree the prophet Samuel

"],["182.53","gonna seem very shocking and harsh to us "],["185.2","this morning but people forget that "],["187.48","where our laws came from what produced "],["190.15","our rights and freedoms and how we got "],["191.95","to where we are today it all stems out "],["194.59","of things that happen way back then so "],["197.08","in our system we get to disagree with "],["199.239","our leadership and we can politic for a "],["200.86","leader we want and that would be okay "],["202.39","however the lies in the hatred that our "],["205.54","system manufactures I would say that "],["207.55","that

that's a little "],["281.2","background as we get into a second "],["282.88","samuel chapter xxi action we're going to "],["285.55","see here is some rebellion verse number "],["288.31","one a

"],["364.71","it was the military men from the other "],["366.599","tribes but Judah David's home tribe "],["369.36","remains loyal and that's part of the "],["371.46","dynamic within the nation the

Ryan and Randy showed "],["46.7","up a little bit late with baby Penelope "],["48.83","and when Ryan stepped around the corner "],["51.26","held up the baby car seats it changed "],["54.199","the whole mood of the room everyone "],["56.9","stopped all the conversations and we all "],["59.269","just took a moment to admire the baby "],["61.91","how small and how cute and how precious "],["66.59","she is and the proud new parents bask in "],["70.159","the observations because that's exactly "],["72.05","how they feel Joe and Terry we're "],["74.9","sitting in the lobby last Sunday

"],["113.54","captures our imagination it's a scene "],["116.15","that every person from every nation from "],["118.43","every period of time can relate to "],["120.38","whether you're rich or poor

like "],["157.26","all right my job's done let's see what "],["159.24","else is next you know that was me I had "],["162.9","to be very old-school with the birth of "],["165.27","my first son Robbie he was emergency "],["167.58","c-section so I couldn't go into the "],["170.1","delivery room I had to wait out in the "],["171.39","hall and that was the good old days "],["172.92","right guys who you remembered like "],["174.09","standing in the hall and just pacing "],["175.77","some of you remember those days now you "],["177.54","get to go in and be a part of it but he "],["179.82","was kind of breached with the cord "],["182.04","wrapped around his neck and it was kind "],["183.48","of scared he's - oh we almost didn't get "],["185.46","him out now Ricky he was a planned "],["186.75","c-section so I got to go in for that "],["188.22","procedure and I'll never forget that he "],["190.41","was he was sideways and he wouldn't turn "],["192.6","just kind of head this way and feet this "],["195.33","way apparently all the McNutt children "],["197.91","were just too big for Ileana to actually "],["199.65","birth them naturally so we were just "],["201.24","causing problems Ricky Robbie was over "],["203.79","eight pounds Ricky was nine six "],["205.68","you know just big I'll never forget they "],["209.97","cut Eliana open and they took what "],["211.95","looked like a big ice cube scoop that "],["215.7","you'd see at a hotel ice machine and "],["219.12","they stuck it in her belly here and they "],["221.04","popped his head out this way and just "],["222.99","come up comes Ricky you know it's a "],["225.18","straight out of this incision it was "],["226.53","wild like aliens man just boom my role "],["233.43","is very limited in the birth of my sons "],["235.05","but I can relate to Joseph trying to get "],["237.21","his wife to a safe place to deliver "],["239.1","these babies trying to protect and "],["240.63","provide all the while feeling very very "],["242.88","helpless through the whole thing how "],["244.74","much more can all relate to the physical "],["248.31","and emotional experience as one goes "],["250.68","through when they give birth all can "],["252.87","think about Mary in that moment without "],["254.55","a doctor without a midwife without a "],["256.32","nurse not even her mom for goodness sake "],["258.27","just a awkward husband that's all she "],["261.63","had in a barn sounds traumatic and yet "],["265.17","when we read this simple description of "],["267.09","Luke chapter 2 verse number seven when "],["269.61","we read this simple verse we always "],["271.89","interpret it as a beautiful loving scene "],["274.82","and she gave birth to her firstborn son "],["277.77","that's it so easy wrapped him in cloths "],["281.01","and laid him in a manger because there "],["283.26","was no room for them in the end it's "],["286.29","such a "],["286.719","it's such a we always visualize "],["288.219","visualize it as this loving scene so "],["291.039","much so it it's depiction is now iconic "],["293.529","isn't it we put the scene up and put it "],["295.839","on our our banners to parents just "],["300.069","standing there in awe and wonder because "],["303.219","after all of the stress and the labor "],["305.319","when it's all over "],["307.029","that is how parents feel isn't it we "],["309.549","feel in awe and wonder that's what we "],["315.699","all feel when we see this newborn for "],["317.349","the first time so we can relate to this "],["318.909","scene but when you add to the fact that "],["322.329","it's not just Mary son this is the son "],["326.979","of God that adds an extra aw to it "],["330.61","doesn't it look at what it said here in "],["332.709","Luke chapter 1 verse 26 126 of Luke now "],["339.879","the sixth month the angel Gabriel was "],["342.039","sent from God to the city of Galilee "],["344.469","called Nazareth to a virgin engaged to a "],["346.599","man who was named Joseph descendant of "],["348.849","David and the Virgin's name was Mary "],["351.029","coming in he said to her greetings "],["353.649","favored one the Lord is with you but she "],["355.539","was perplexed by this statement here's "],["357.969","an angel Wow "],["359.019","kept partner and what kind of salutation "],["361.389","this was and the angel said do not be "],["362.949","afraid Mary for you have found favor "],["365.019","with God behold you will conceive in "],["367.809","your womb and bear a son and you shall "],["369.969","call his name Jesus he will be great and "],["373.389","will be called the son of the Most High "],["375.729","and the Lord God will give him the "],["377.86","throne of his father David and he will "],["380.529","reign over the house of Jacob forever "],["382.089","his kingdom will have no end "],["384.999","Mary said to the angel how can this be "],["387.61","since I am a virgin the angel said the "],["390.039","Holy Spirit will come upon you and the "],["391.809","power the most high will overshadow you "],["393.459","and for that reason the Holy Child will "],["396.699","be called the son of God the Son of God "],["401.229","so there's an aspect of this story that "],["403.659","we can relate to but then there's this "],["405.969","other aspect that we have nothing like "],["408.369","this has ever been happened ever "],["410.05","it's uncompounded what does this mean "],["417.069","for God does it mean for God the son of "],["420.43","God ponder that for a moment God the "],["422.74","Creator the one who is transcended "],["426.34","outside of time in space the one who is "],["429.49","beyond our physical realm in reality is "],["432.64","going to become one of us and not just "],["436.48","materialized as a man in his prime but "],["439.93","he's going to come as a frail helpless "],["442.69","baby and trust his life to the care of "],["446.02","his creation knowing how limited and "],["450.25","finite how weak and susceptible the "],["452.62","human body is much less the baby that "],["455.14","can't even feed himself that's how God "],["457.39","came to us in that lowly form not really "],["462.43","much of a God not not very impressive or "],["465.31","powerful one might initially think but "],["468.13","when you think and it is an act of "],["471.28","incredible power and strength to take on "],["474.34","the weakest helpless form and know that "],["477.58","you're still going to be protected "],["479.52","knowing that the plan is still going to "],["481.84","work that that is the ultimate show of "],["484.42","power to strip away everything and then "],["488.65","still be in control at the same time "],["490.8","what better way to prove that you are "],["493.15","eminent within your creation and still "],["495.25","transcended outside of it what better "],["497.44","way to show that you are omnipresent to "],["500.05","be helpless babe and still Creator God "],["502.36","holding everything together at the same "],["504.07","time what better way to show you were "],["507.01","all-powerful when you know that your "],["510.19","adversary the devil wants to destroy you "],["512.17","and you make yourself completely "],["513.7","vulnerable and he still can't get to you "],["516.27","the devil still couldn't get in the "],["519.07","upper hand even when Jesus was a baby he "],["521.74","couldn't capitalize on that so many "],["524.14","layers of miraculous going on here we "],["526.69","could never completely understand what "],["529.03","this means for God to be man all we can "],["534.34","do is what Mary did in Luke chapter 2 "],["538.06","verse 19 where it simply said but Mary "],["541.42","treasured all of these things pondering "],["545.38","them in her hearts pondering what what "],["549.79","does that mean "],["550.66","I posed that question to "],["553.6","the church Thursday afternoon I sent you "],["555.759","an email and I said I'm curious to hear "],["557.649","what you think she was pondering

so you went back and you did a "],["603.819","history lesson and you said well Mary "],["605.38","got the message from the angel and then "],["607.06","she went and visited her cousin "],["609.19","Elizabeth and then the Shepherd's "],["610.87","testimony and the even new prophecy so "],["613.63","all of these things encompassed all of "],["615.279","that you made that observation some of "],["616.87","you zoomed in on the action words the "],["618.939","verbs and you defined them Mary "],["620.23","treasured and she pondered and treasured "],["623.68","is this is this

"],["546.649","were fulfilled in Jesus lifetime Old "],["549.019","Testament prophecies amazing Christmas "],["551.99","the coming of Jesus was worth the wait "],["555.579","only one problem what's the problem "],["560.019","specifically what's the problem with "],["561.889","this angel's message first number 31 it "],["565.399","says you will conceive in your womb and "],["568.16","bear a child you call his name Jesus got "],["569.72","that right he will be great verse 32 the "],["572.779","son of the Most High and the Lord God "],["574.16","will give him the throne of his father "],["575.48","David he will reign over the house of "],["577.22","Jacob forever his kingdom will have no "],["579.019","end what's the problem hasn't happened "],["584.389","yet has it that still hasn't happened "],["586.67","now some folks will say well he in a "],["589.309","spiritual realm it has happened mark 16 "],["592.91","verse number 19 so then the Lord had "],["594.589","spoken to them he was received up into "],["596.029","heaven and sat down at the right hand of "],["598.129","God so there's no greater throne than "],["600.019","the throne of heaven obviously that is "],["602.869","an eternal throne yes but that's not "],["605.209","what the prophecies called for Micah "],["608.269","chapter 4 and up verse number 7 says the "],["610.249","Lord will reign over them from Mount "],["611.929","Zion forever see we take scripture very "],["617.749","literally the Lord promised David's "],["621.11","throne in Israel in the land in "],["623.689","Jerusalem in Zion the Messiah would "],["625.819","reign that's what the angel foretold "],["628.639","that has not happens Jesus has never "],["632.149","ruled on an earthly throne so there's "],["635.209","two conclusions one can cop with one the "],["639.379","angel lied and it's not going to happen "],["641.749","or it still has to come and we have to "],["648.019","keep waiting as we've already stated "],["652.339","Jesus came and fulfilled over 300 "],["654.74","prophecies in his lifetime the biggest "],["656.509","one being he was crucified he was buried "],["659.629","and he and he rose again and which is "],["663.35","the whole point of his first coming so "],["665.389","it's a proven fact that Jesus did come "],["667.879","even if you don't believe in Jesus "],["670.07","who he was the facts are still the facts "],["672.5","Jesus was born and fulfilled prophecy "],["674.39","and God didn't lie on that point if you "],["676.79","believe in Jesus if you believe the "],["678.23","Bible the only conclusion you can come "],["679.79","to is the prophecy is still unfinished "],["682.85","it's just uncomplete and that we can all "],["685.79","agree on but incomplete is not the same "],["688.94","as wrong is it due to the fact that it "],["691.55","took over an estimated four thousand "],["694.01","years since the prophecy was made the "],["695.42","eve till Jesus came it took over two "],["698.03","thousand years since the promises were "],["699.56","made to Abraham till Jesus came what "],["702.2","that indicates to us is the fact that "],["704.12","waiting a long time for a fulfilled "],["706.58","prophecy is not uncommon in Scripture "],["710.26","just because it takes a long time "],["712.58","doesn't prove that God's not going to do "],["714.56","it or God has changed his mind or he's "],["716.99","failed no no God transcends time and his "],["721.34","appointed times are only known by him "],["724.19","and they'll only be done when he deems "],["726.83","the time has come "],["728.8","delay is not derailments which means we "],["733.85","have to do what all you people of God we "],["738.08","have to do the same thing that the "],["739.25","people of God all down through the "],["740.48","millennia have had to do we have to "],["742.39","waits for Christmas and not get tired of "],["746.96","waiting so we're all still waiting for "],["749.33","another Christmas another time when "],["750.89","Christ will be sent when he's coming "],["753.65","back again now when he came the first "],["756.47","time even though there were all these "],["758.15","prophecies you know most people missed "],["759.68","it didn't they wasn't a grand "],["762.17","celebration on earth when he came the "],["765.05","first time it was a poor couple all "],["767.69","alone a hundred miles away from home in "],["770.48","a place where animals were kept that's "],["772.76","how Jesus came the only people that knew "],["774.68","about it were some shepherds that got "],["776.6","the news from some angels so they went "],["779.36","to visit Jesus Mary and Joseph and that "],["781.52","was it everyone else missed it didn't "],["786.17","they "],["786.47","and nobody really understood how and why "],["789.74","he came in that manner until after his "],["792.65","crucifixion and resurrection after the "],["795.95","prophecies were fulfilled then people "],["797.78","got it uh which was okay it was God's "],["801.65","intention for Jesus to come in that "],["803.3","manner "],["803.81","why didn't he want why didn't God want "],["806.15","everyone to know the first time two "],["809.779","reasons first reasons for jesus safety "],["813.16","because you remember as the story "],["815.12","unfolds in matthew chapter 2 we learned "],["816.86","that the wise men who saw the star and "],["819.29","knew that was the sign and showed up "],["821.12","into jerusalem saying hey where's the "],["823.1","where's the where's the king that was "],["824.48","born that didn't work out so well for "],["827.21","the kids did it because hair got all "],["829.7","irate and he went over there to "],["830.99","bethlehem and killed all the children "],["832.22","and he was trying to protect his power "],["835.029","and he saw he saw the the newborn king "],["837.98","as a threat and so once we saw that we "],["841.279","realized the general population missing "],["843.74","the arrival that was okay probably a "],["847.46","good thing the number two reason why God "],["850.4","didn't want everyone to know is because "],["851.75","Jesus wasn't coming to rule was he he "],["855.2","didn't come to earth to rule it wasn't "],["857.27","it's time for that he was coming to "],["858.62","serve he if they made him a king the "],["862.07","first time he would have been able to do "],["863.93","what he came to do which was to lay down "],["865.61","his life to sacrifice himself for the "],["867.83","sin of the whole world so it was "],["869.27","perfectly okay for people to miss his "],["871.13","first coming and then believe on it "],["873.14","after the fact which is what we've all "],["874.97","done right we now believe on it after "],["877.13","the fact now that is not the case when "],["881.39","he returns it's not okay for people to "],["884.51","miss his coming again and believe after "],["887.48","the fact because he's not coming back as "],["890.089","infant lowly infant holy in a lowly "],["893.15","cattle stall no he's coming back to "],["895.01","fulfill prophecies as the angel has "],["897.5","spoken here that he will be great and "],["899.75","he'll be called the son of the Most High "],["901.1","and the Lord God will give him the "],["902.81","throne of David and he will reign over "],["904.4","the house of Jacob and his kingdom will "],["906.44","have no end "],["908.23","that's what how he's coming back to rule "],["910.97","the earth and when he does nobody's "],["914.51","gonna miss this one says in Matthew "],["916.61","chapter 24 and then the sign of the Son "],["920.42","of Man will appear in the sky and all "],["922.339","the tribes of the earth will mourn while "],["925.16","he morning and be scared because they're "],["927.62","going to see the Son of man coming in "],["929.029","the clouds

"],["935.959","winds and from "],["937.1","the ends of the sky to the other when he "],["940.04","comes back to rain what does that mean "],["942.08","for all the people who think they're in "],["943.49","control who want to continue to keep "],["945.32","their control it will mean is that those "],["947.87","people who don't trust in Jesus and "],["950.05","think that their religions are okay "],["952.25","they're in for a rude awakening our "],["953.96","thing okay this is gonna sound really "],["958.07","weird but I'm gonna point it out anyways "],["962.8","have you noticed all the plots of movies "],["966.17","nowadays that deal with some alien "],["968.24","taking over the earth or either some "],["971.99","chosen superhero mankind has to fight "],["974.77","against them and all the movie plots the "],["977.93","alien taking over is bad and destructive "],["980.54","but the hero prevents it and they save "],["982.91","mankind and they saved the earth and you "],["986.15","know once you get to be my age you "],["987.41","realize you've seen the same movie a "],["988.82","thousand times some of you know what I'm "],["991.07","talking about right the same plot the "],["992.66","same story's told over and over and over "],["994.46","you know marble and the Transformers "],["997.1","they keep telling the same story well so "],["1000.49","why'd it's science fiction yeah I know "],["1001.75","big deal right I mean why they can't "],["1006.46","come up with some new ideas is a little "],["1007.69","bit odd but that's how it is but the "],["1009.88","other thing you notice when you study "],["1011.77","prophecy and you take God's Word "],["1013.27","literally when you believe in Jesus when "],["1015.31","you're looking for his coming literal "],["1017.74","Messiah who's going to overthrow the "],["1019.39","corrupt rulers of the world and destroy "],["1021.07","all who oppose him and and take over and "],["1023.92","rebuild

"],["1031.87","place where it stands against God's laws "],["1034.06","and against God's standard of truth the "],["1036.13","other thing you notice is all of these "],["1039.04","movies are telling

to talk about today basically "],["628.01","someone asked jesus himself what is the "],["631.01","most important thing it's red letters so "],["634.13","we have confirmation that it's Jesus "],["636.17","speaking right we all know whether oh "],["639.07","that was added after the original text "],["642.23","was written but the translators put it "],["644.54","in red letters for us so we

people listen yeah those "],["656.48","of you don't you can look it up later "],["657.74","i'm dating myself but this is Jesus "],["660.62","talking so when he have Hutton Pete "],["662.18","speaks

"],["670.94","I'm dating myself moving on Jesus answer "],["673.13","the question of what is most important "],["675.17","with love love for God and for our "],["677.54","neighbors so when people ask questions "],["679.25","like what is the meaning of life it's "],["682.13","not "],["682.88","42 as the hitchhiker's guide to the "],["684.92","galaxy states what's the point why are "],["687.08","you here what is this thing what is the "],["689.45","thing what is the most important thing "],["690.8","in our lives I think we as Christians "],["693.16","need to have love be the first thing "],["695.66","that pops into our mind and out of our "],["697.37","mouth in order to answer that question "],["698.72","love God and love our neighbors that's "],["701.6","the most important thing that's what "],["702.98","Jesus said so that ought to pop into our "],["705.14","minds when we asked questions that are "],["706.76","similar so what is this love that you "],["708.56","speak of you've heard pastor Robb talk "],["710.63","about the different forms of love in the "],["712.25","Greek there's eros where we get our "],["714.77","romantic one I mean we're kind of the "],["717.38","society today teaches valentine's Day is "],["719.6","all about roses and cards and hearts and "],["722.75","flowers and diamonds and all other stuff "],["725.18","but is that really the love that we're "],["727.46","talking about here I think we all know "],["729.11","it's not this is the love that the world "],["732.05","wants us to focus on though whenever you "],["733.94","see movies or TV shows or hear anything "],["736.79","that has to do with relationships "],["737.87","between people you hear the term love "],["740.48","used but what you see in the imagery "],["742.94","that's put before you and in the plot "],["744.95","line is sexual activity in lust that's "],["747.47","what you see that's what the world wants "],["749.24","you to believe love is because if you "],["751.73","have an unban of what love is you can't "],["756.26","translate the original scripture that we "],["758.42","put up here which is love your love God "],["760.37","and love your neighbor because when you "],["762.47","think about God you think about romantic "],["764.15","love ooh right no one wants to think "],["766.91","about that that's not how we are "],["768.59","supposed to be thinking about God but "],["770.12","Satan is deceiving us he's turning our "],["773.42","society and he has for years and years "],["775.49","and years for time

and love is one of the central "],["787.16","themes that Satan has tried to take "],["789.71","control of and use for his purposes for "],["792.92","the since the beginning of time we've "],["794.57","been lied to that's not the love that "],["796.28","Jesus was talking about Satan would "],["798.08","happily have us believe that this is the "],["800.12","definition of love because when we hear "],["801.74","Jesus say love God and then our "],["803.45","definition of love is that which is "],["804.95","provided by Hollywood it just doesn't "],["806.78","translate how can you love God if you "],["809.12","have a faulty definition of what love is "],["810.91","people start to stray from the truth "],["813.23","when they don't understand they're very "],["815.21","heart of a war "],["816.18","that is being used while eros isn't "],["819.3","specifically called out in Scripture it "],["820.86","is referred to in the Song of Solomon "],["822.24","but for today's purposes it's important "],["825.21","for us to just recognize that this is "],["826.77","not the love that has talked about when "],["829.08","jesus said love God and love your "],["831.42","neighbor there's also story a love "],["833.25","that's the family love you see the the "],["835.17","mother and father kissing the child "],["836.61","there there's no mention of store gay "],["839.67","love

formed that's what a lot of "],["866.73","people translate that love to be this "],["869.279","form of love is actually mentioned in "],["871.2","Scripture and when it's talking about "],["873.089","filet filet o love in Scripture it's "],["875.88","talking about the love between brothers "],["877.8","and sisters of Christ so that though is "],["880.98","not the type of love that

whatever you want to call him was "],["891.48","agape love it's the unconditional love "],["896.209","we've probably talked about agape love a "],["898.83","few hundred times but to refresh

"],["1002.54","would call a definition in my book less "],["1004.79","is is followed by like it is like "],["1007.22","something then it is giving us a "],["1009.11","definition or a defining

explain what I mean this week I've "],["89.97","been studying the word power throughout "],["92.58","the New Testament and I felt that there "],["94.5","was something elusive about the way the "],["96.81","New Testament used this work that there "],["99.27","was something more that I needed to look "],["101.19","into so I did and I found four important "],["105.24","ways that the New Testament used power "],["108.39","and that these go beyond what would be "],["112.979","normally used for the word power "],["114.84","basically power means the ability to do "],["118.11","something that resides in some one so "],["122.22","when we talk about power normally we "],["124.619","might say something like it's not in my "],["127.44","power to do that so like dick nebula "],["130.83","might say it's not in my power to make "],["133.98","that church building back there get "],["136.23","finished so stop asking me know "],["141.6","right is it's not in his power he can't "],["144.49","himself finish that building right and "],["148.06","as humans we really don't have much "],["150.76","power and other times we talk about "],["154.42","power in in reference to might like we "],["158.2","have all sorts of might in the most "],["160.93","general way so God is all-powerful and "],["164.77","he's mighty enough to do anything he has "],["168.52","all the power but when we take those "],["172.63","general references out of our pool of "],["175.42","verses about power we're left with some "],["178","specific aspects of power specific "],["181.24","things that we might think as odd to "],["183.67","have power and power working in "],["185.65","interesting places so there are four "],["189.43","interesting aspects of the word power in "],["191.89","the New Testament that I found and they "],["194.05","are first power shown in miracles second "],["198.19","power through the Holy Spirit third "],["200.67","gospel power and finally power at work "],["204.7","in us the first interesting aspect of "],["209.41","power in the New Testament is power "],["211.84","shown in miracles at the beginning of "],["215.11","the New Testament Jesus steps on the "],["217.57","scene and he has the strength to do "],["221.67","supernatural stuff he heals the "],["224.65","terminally ill he makes the plying the "],["227.23","blind people able to see he casts out "],["230.14","demons this is power in action power at "],["234.79","work not powering a general or anything "],["240.85","like frail human power but this is power "],["243.61","like no one has ever seen before now "],["247.12","Matthew tells us about people's reaction "],["249.76","to Jesus's power in Matthew 1453 he says "],["254.35","coming to his hometown he began teaching "],["257.14","the people in their synagogues and they "],["259.39","were amazed where did this man get this "],["262.27","wisdom and these miraculous powers the "],["265.9","question where did this man get the "],["268.96","ability to do these things this is "],["272.74","something being "],["274.24","what is natural no man has the ability "],["276.55","to do anything like this and that's "],["279.22","exactly why Jesus performed miracles "],["282.99","Jesus proved to the world that he was "],["286.18","supernatural through the miracles that "],["289.24","he did where did this man get these "],["291.849","Wizards wisdom and these miraculous "],["294.49","powers he got them from himself because "],["298.539","he was God he had the ability within "],["301.96","himself to heal the sick to give the "],["304.99","blind sight and they cast out demons "],["308.19","Jesus had miraculous power he brought "],["312.069","the idea the guy generally has all power "],["315.46","and he threw it right in people's faces "],["319.74","God not only has supernatural power but "],["323.229","his son Jesus is using that power to "],["326.8","take what is it broke and to fix it "],["330.81","that's pretty amazing stuff now the next "],["334.3","big aspect of power in the New Testament "],["336.52","is power through the Holy Spirit Jesus "],["340.99","as we've already seen he has miraculous "],["344.139","power the ability to do amazing things "],["346.62","he tells his disciples this but you will "],["350.919","receive power when the Holy Spirit comes "],["353.59","upon you and you will be my witnesses in "],["356.11","Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria "],["358.84","and to the ends of the earth the "],["362.169","disciples received this power and they "],["365.469","were able to perform miracles like Jesus "],["368.139","did now obviously the disciples were "],["370.75","just men like you and I or women not "],["374.86","like me but like you some of you so they "],["378.4","did not have the power in themselves to "],["381.61","do the miraculous the disciples had no "],["385.75","divine nature that gave them the power "],["387.819","to do anything that power came from the "],["391.599","Spirit of God the Holy Spirit of God "],["394.889","gave them the power of God to do things "],["399.58","that only God could and the spirits "],["403.089","power in the disciples like Jesus's "],["406","miracles showed the world that "],["408.08","something supernatural was happening in "],["410.96","them those miracles proved that God's "],["413.87","power was at work in the disciples they "],["417.379","proved that the message that these guys "],["419.479","preached about God's Son dying for their "],["422.75","sins and rising again the miracles "],["426.5","proved that that message was from God "],["429.86","himself now the next use of power in the "],["433.4","New Testament is really interesting to "],["435.71","me it's where a few questions started "],["438.139","upon in Romans 116 Paul says for I am "],["443.3","not ashamed of the gospel because it is "],["445.34","the power of God that brings salvation "],["447.86","to everyone who believes first to the "],["450.77","Jew then to the Gentile so Paul is "],["454.43","saying here that the gospel is the power "],["457.759","of God basically the gospel is power "],["463.719","just reading the definition of power "],["466.219","into that verse how can the gospel have "],["469.4","the ability to bring salvation how can "],["473.21","the gospel itself be the power of God "],["477.669","now Paul says something similar in first "],["480.44","Corinthians 118 about gospel power he "],["483.05","says for the message of the Cross is "],["485.839","foolishness to those who are perishing "],["487.789","but to us who are being saved it is the "],["490.909","power of God according to Paul the "],["495.169","message of the Cross that Christ came "],["498.319","down to earth and died for our sins that "],["502.729","is the power of God but that still "],["507.259","doesn't answer how the gospel itself has "],["510.05","power and what that power even means is "],["513.589","in the gospel just a message isn't it "],["517.07","just a story a powerful story "],["520.449","nonetheless but it seems like still a "],["523.399","story reading through some of these "],["525.74","passages it makes it seem like God's "],["527.93","supernatural power sits behind the "],["530.57","message of the gospel in some way I mean "],["534.38","listen to some of these passages in "],["535.97","first Corinthians Paul tells the "],["537.86","Corinthians how he shared the gospel "],["539.959","with them he says "],["541.74","my message in my preaching were not with "],["543.87","wise and persuasive words but with a "],["545.73","demonstration of the spirit's power so "],["548.46","that your faith may not rest on human "],["550.44","wisdom but on God's power Paul's message "],["554.94","and his preaching was not with human "],["557.7","wisdom but with a demonstration of the "],["560.37","spirit's power now right there it sounds "],["563.88","to me like Paul is saying that his "],["566.43","preaching gave the Corinthians a taste "],["568.86","of God's power so that they could put "],["572.22","their belief in God's power instead of "],["575.58","just wise words from Paul so the "],["579.69","inherent power of the gospel was the "],["583.68","foundation of their faith now later on "],["587.1","Paul hits the same point again he says "],["588.96","for the kingdom of God is not a matter "],["591.3","of talk but of power the kingdom of God "],["595.86","is about preaching words with power not "],["599.7","preaching persuasively so apparently "],["603.33","there's some power within the gospel "],["605.76","itself that is the basis for our faith "],["609.09","in second Corinthians Paul puts it this "],["611.94","way we have this treasure the gospel in "],["615.2","jars of clay and there he's talking "],["617.43","about Christians to show that this all "],["620.61","surpassing power is from God and not "],["623.97","from us so this gospel we contain it as "],["629.46","only jars of clay so people can see that "],["633.42","this gospel power is from God and not "],["636.09","from us the Gospels ability to "],["640.17","accomplish is not from us it's from God "],["643.13","we're just simple clay vessels that are "],["645.93","normal boring breakable jars but "],["649.86","contained inside of us is this all "],["652.34","surpassing power from God called the "],["655.77","gospel and when people look at us they "],["659.07","see wow this guy's just a normal boring "],["663.5","breakable container for something "],["666.27","amazing inside and as I was reading "],["670.71","through these uses of power in the New "],["672.45","Testament I could not help but be in "],["675.47","treat by this power and something so "],["678.86","special that it's worth grounding our "],["681.41","faith on it's something that when people "],["684.05","get a taste of it they know that it is "],["687.5","God just like the miracles of Jesus that "],["689.93","proved that he was God were the miracles "],["692.18","the disciples did through the Holy "],["693.98","Spirit that proved that their message "],["696.29","was from God the gospel has power in "],["700.07","itself to prove that it is from God and "],["703.25","not from then so what is this power that "],["706.94","we're supposed to base our faith on that "],["710","is within the gospel I think one final "],["715.07","aspect of the word power in the New "],["717.2","Testament really brought things together "],["719.92","and it reveals a lot to us Paul "],["723.29","concludes the book of Ephesians this way "],["725.74","he says now to him who is able to do "],["729.23","immeasurably more than all we ask or "],["731.66","imagine according to his power that is "],["734.66","at work in us okay so here Paul states "],["738.44","that God's power that could do way more "],["741.89","than anything that we could ask or "],["744.8","imagine that that's inside of us not "],["748.13","only that but it's at work in us so "],["751.79","there is power inside of us from God to "],["755","do way more than we could ever ask power "],["759.64","inside of us now i'm just a normal human "],["762.92","being I don't feel like there's some "],["765.23","above normal power inside of me I'm not "],["769.55","doing what Jesus or the disciples did "],["771.68","I'm not healing the sick I'm not "],["774.44","bringing blind men to site not casting "],["777.56","demons out and if it's not power in that "],["781.31","sense in what power do we have this "],["784.73","power or in what sense do we have this "],["788.45","power inside of us now here's another "],["792.05","interesting verse we constantly pray for "],["795.5","you that our God may make you worthy of "],["797.78","his calling and that by his power he may "],["800.93","bring to fruition your every desire for "],["803.48","goodness and your everyday prompted by "],["805.73","faith so Paul prays for "],["808.94","us believers then we would by God's "],["812.66","power within us bring about every desire "],["816.02","and every good deed faith prompts that "],["820.78","God's power will give us the ability to "],["825.8","do good things so God's power is working "],["829.91","in us to help us do good things that we "],["833.38","could only think about on our own he's "],["836.96","the one giving us the ability to do them "],["839.8","and I think one last verse about power "],["843.29","really brought things together for me "],["845.51","and it's odd because Paul describes not "],["847.85","what gospel power looks like but the "],["850.88","opposite he talks about what godliness "],["853.79","without power looks like so in first and "],["857.57","in second Timothy 3 2 through 5 Paul "],["860.33","says of those who claim to be Christian "],["862.85","but don't look like it that they will be "],["865.85","lovers of themselves lovers of money "],["868.36","boastful proud abusive disobedient to "],["872.48","their parents dot dot dot he just keeps "],["875.45","going every bad behavior you can imagine "],["878.26","and then he comes and puts in this big "],["882.74","dash and he explains that people who "],["884.9","claim to be Christians and are doing "],["887.18","these disobedient things that they have "],["889.67","a form of godliness but denying its "],["893.03","power now this is just the opposite of "],["896.27","the last verse that we just studied in "],["899.27","the last verse guys power and abled "],["902.33","Christians to do good and in this worse "],["908.38","people are claiming to be Christians but "],["910.64","they're not doing good so they are "],["914.089","missing the power the ability to do what "],["917.72","is good the ability to do the things "],["921.05","that God wants them to do they have a "],["924.589","form of godliness so in the dark they "],["927.8","might have a silhouette of godliness but "],["930.47","when the light comes on it looks nothing "],["933.53","like it then denying God's power to "],["937.67","change their lives they deny power to "],["941.54","give them the strength "],["942.8","to do what God calls is good and right "],["947","there i think that the Gospels power "],["949.07","makes sense right there that's something "],["952.01","that we can hold on to that the gospel "],["955.01","gives us the ability to do what is good "],["957.23","when we only have the power to do what "],["960.68","is wrong the gospel gives us a taste of "],["963.62","God's power because the gospel gives us "],["966.98","the power to change something that we "],["970.519","cannot do on our own and it is this "],["973.43","power the godliness depends on it is "],["976.7","this power that is essential to people "],["979.399","coming to faith in Christ then power "],["982.49","something miraculous something that "],["984.74","proves that God is behind this message "],["987.98","the power to change is the power of the "],["991.82","gospel that we put our faith we put our "],["995.45","faith in the power of God so we talked "],["999.589","about the uselessness of devices without "],["1002.14","power in the beginning I think now we "],["1004.99","can see how useless the crosses without "],["1008.709","God's power and how useless the churches "],["1012.19","without God's power take the cross it's "],["1016.66","just sitting there it's wood on a wall "],["1020.02","in a certain shape has no practical "],["1023.14","purpose except well I guess the Romans "],["1025.9","invented it to kill people so it means "],["1029.429","nothing without power but the crosses "],["1033.91","power is that Jesus was crucified on it "],["1037.839","to free us from sin so that we could be "],["1041.47","made like God the power of this cross is "],["1044.77","not so that we could have a cool wall "],["1047.14","decoration in our churches the power of "],["1050.2","this cross is not so that we could be "],["1052.51","it's even not so that we could be saved "],["1054.7","from eternal damnation in hell the power "],["1058.3","of this cross is that we can be changed "],["1062.16","we can be made new instead of hiding in "],["1065.86","the darkness we can live in the light "],["1067.78","instead of cowering behind our fear we "],["1070.6","can act in confidence because we know "],["1073.24","that we are the children of God instead "],["1076.76","being slaves to our flesh we can be "],["1079.19","slaves to righteousness that is the "],["1083.24","power of the cross that's why the gospel "],["1086.21","is salvation to us because we don't have "],["1089.03","to stay this broken person that we are "],["1092.53","therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a "],["1095.6","new creature the old things have passed "],["1098.39","away behold new things have come it's "],["1103.16","true of the cross and it's true of the "],["1106.07","church we're just a bunch of people who "],["1108.86","get together on sunday mornings in talk "],["1111.17","and sing if there's no power we're just "],["1115.01","only a little club of people like to do "],["1117.71","stuff together if there's no power but i "],["1122.3","believe something greater is going on "],["1124.61","here i believe that the gospel is in "],["1127.25","this church and then the gospel is in "],["1129.83","the hearts of us people and that God is "],["1134.06","taking old things that he's making them "],["1137","new right here in our midst I believe "],["1140.81","that God's power is here at faith bible "],["1143.87","church well simple test right what has "],["1149.66","God made new here at faith bible church "],["1153.19","well let me start with me mark lindgren "],["1155.69","the one who posed the question that "],["1157.79","should be the first to try and answer it "],["1160.78","what his guide made knew about me well "],["1164.69","I've been here at faith bible church "],["1166.42","well to start with I was saved at a "],["1169.91","youth event that faith bible church "],["1173.36","youth group went on so i came to know "],["1177.2","the power of the gospel while I've been "],["1179.66","here and at that time i was a broken and "],["1183.68","jumbled mess i was severely depressed i "],["1188.59","had isolated myself from the love of my "],["1191.51","family and my friends I felt worthless "],["1195.58","valueless totally lost I tried to I had "],["1201.41","tried to be more popular I tried to be "],["1204.02","more funny I tried to feel like my life "],["1207.5","had meaning and all that gave me "],["1210.94","but then God stepped in he said to me "],["1215.48","that he wanted a relationship with me "],["1218.53","and that's powerful but God didn't stop "],["1222.53","there he didn't just start a "],["1224.84","relationship with me and leave me with a "],["1227.69","broken minded a despairing heart he "],["1231.05","changed me he empowered me to be free "],["1234.62","from the tangled web of lies in my head "],["1237.17","and the selfishness in my heart he built "],["1240.68","me a new foundation for his meaning and "],["1243.86","value in his love for me and he's just "],["1248.48","getting started there's way way more "],["1252.38","work to be done in my life and God has "],["1255.83","not done and I thank him so much for "],["1259.7","that so I'm going to pose the question "],["1264.2","to some others in here what has what "],["1268.85","changed his faith bible church brought "],["1270.65","in your life what is the gospel really "],["1273.29","here that's my question and i know that "],["1276.77","there is proof right in here and i "],["1279.68","believe that it's in you okay i feel "],["1284.18","like i can say the gods power and so "],["1288.23","you're changing us i know there's more "],["1290.03","stories we don't have time to tell them "],["1292.46","all and you know it's hard to you know "],["1296.12","get up and actually say something in "],["1297.92","front of people I understand that but "],["1301.42","from the stories i've heard through "],["1304.79","wanna through through us changing our "],["1308.18","broken past and making it useful for the "],["1310.73","future and through giving us a heart to "],["1314.81","change other people I can see that God's "],["1316.91","power is it work here and it's at work "],["1321.2","in us but sometimes we forget about it "],["1325.01","and sometimes we look at ourselves and "],["1327.95","we see that wow we're still pretty "],["1330.67","broken we're still pretty messed up "],["1333.88","where's God's power in my life I think "],["1338.57","we need to constantly remind ourselves "],["1340.4","to take a step back to take a look at "],["1344.03","the cross "],["1344.57","and see all of the same that God has "],["1347.659","killed in our hearts with that cross to "],["1351.799","see how far God's power has allowed us "],["1354.529","to come and then we got to get to work "],["1358.1","we got to look at the sin that's still "],["1360.59","in our lives it's still in our hearts "],["1363.259","and be strengthened by God to take "],["1365.75","action

see that God "],["1393.409","one day at a time has been ripping that "],["1396.799","sin from your heart and making you knew "],["1400.6","one day at a time there's a danger to "],["1404.69","take the

"],["1415.549","among us but that's not the real test of "],["1419.289","God's work among us it's the power to "],["1423.529","change we use the people of this body of "],["1427.429","this church we

Bowl Judgements (Pastor Rob McNutt)","date":"2024-12-29","transcript":[[21.88,"so last Sunday of "],[26.8,"2024 who else feels like the year just "],[30.28,"blew "],[31.68,"by I feel like for me the week starts "],[35,"and then all of a sudden Sunday's upon "],[37.12,"me and that happens every week and then "],[40.2,"I look up and the year's over what "],[42.24,"happened where'd it go what did we "],[45.28,"accomplish here Faith Bible Church in "],[49.24,"2024 I think we ought to take a minute "],[51.12,"to reflect what quite a year of change "],[53.8,"and transition here for Faith Bible uh "],[56.2,"big thing we talked about a year ago was "],[58.8,"the revitalizing ation of s of Bible "],[61.76,"Church they needed a pastor someone who "],[64,"could down there and calm Troubled "],[65.72,"Waters and love people teach the word "],[67.52,"and help them rebuild their Ministries "],[69.64,"so it was obvious that Pastor Greg and "],[72.68,"Wendy would provide all that so last "],[75.64,"January Greg and Wendy left us with some "],[78.04,"Faithful Servants with them we gave up "],[80.84,"some leaders some Sunday school teachers "],[82.68,"children's church workers faithful "],[85.36,"givers and we put a lot of resources "],[88.52,"committed to going down there we paid "],[91.12,"Greg's salary for part of the year how "],[93.76,"did it work out well actually better "],[97.52,"than we expected sa of Bible Church is "],[100.2,"up and on their feet uh by the first "],[102.64,"quarter they were operational uh we paid "],[106,"Greg through the fall and just to make "],[109.08,"sure they could get a little buffer "],[111.12,"built up and they're doing very well "],[113.04,"their attendance is doubled their "],[114.24,"children's ministries are operational we "],[116,"had a couple of events during the year "],[117.56,"where we brought both churches together "],[119.28,"and the love the unity was felt by all "],[122.88,"so despite sending uh a group to cive we "],[127.56,"have been able to maintain our "],[129.04,"attendance throughout the whole year we "],[130.52,"averaged about 550 people every Sunday "],[134.48,"uh uh the loss of seasoned workers did "],[138.8,"put some strain on our Ministries uh we "],[142.32,"gave up some Dependable people "],[144.16,"especially we felt it in the Children's "],[145.84,"Ministries nevertheless our Faithful "],[148.16,"Servants committed to the vision of "],[150.24,"teaching the children stepped up and did "],[152.68,"the job every time we have the baby "],[155.12,"dedications we pledge as a congregation "],[157.64,"to assist the families in raising the "],[160.04,"children up in the faith our Ministries "],[163.12,"for all ages parents and children help "],[166.12,"them learn and grow spiritually so we "],[168.92,"continued that the other big thing that "],[171.12,"happened around here was the expansion "],[173,"of our physical property and having more "],[175.08,"space immediately made our counseling "],[177.64,"Ministry our coaching and support groups "],[180.56,"more effective these Ministries and "],[182.84,"programs likewise help people deepen "],[184.96,"their understanding of how to personally "],[186.92,"and practically glorify God in their "],[189.24,"individual lives even now the "],[191.28,"Philadelphia team well not literally now "],[192.92,"they're getting a break right now but "],[194.08,"John's got a team the Philadelphia Team "],[196.32,"all of our guys working uh and if you "],[198.28,"haven't been in on that get in on the "],[199.76,"emails with Brother John Murdoch "],[201.4,"renovating they've been working "],[202.92,"renovating the big garage out here for "],[205.28,"the Youth the youth are going to C4 "],[207.24,"youth are going to have a new space to "],[209,"do their Ministry "],[210.36,"and that's going to give the aana "],[212,"program an opportunity to just blow up "],[214.16,"and take over the whole building because "],[215.72,"they're practically doing that "],[217.84,"anyways I'm personally very supportive "],[220.32,"of all these children's ministries "],[221.92,"because as a child I participate in all "],[224.96,"of them and they assisted my Spiritual "],[228.6,"Development I was involved in child "],[231.08,"evangelism Fellowship uh Sunday school "],[233.76,"aana that was huge in enhancing my uh "],[237.24,"scripture memorization I learned so "],[239.36,"manys in aana I went to youth group and "],[242.4,"all these programs when I was a child so "],[244.56,"many people poured into me this little "],[248.2,"church The People's Church in Somerville "],[250.44,"New Brunswick started in "],[253.28,"1952 as I I kind of waddled in there in "],[257.28,"1975 and that that was just a tiny "],[259.96,"little church it's a funny thing because "],[262.24,"I can remember uh very distinctly the "],[265.2,"the entryway it just had one of those um "],[268.96,"spring doors those old you remember the "],[270.8,"barn doors with the springs on them who "],[272.56,"who remembers those types of old doors "],[274.24,"you just yeah you they' just snap back "],[276.44,"real fast you know they hit you they get "],[278.28,"you in the door it's Canada you know "],[279.84,"they get you it's cold and you walk in "],[282,"and just be a little a little turnaround "],[284.2,"entryway and you could either go down "],[285.84,"the stairs or you could go up the stairs "],[287.76,"and up the stairs was of course the "],[289.12,"sanctuary it could see 80 people maybe a "],[291.84,"hundred packed in and if you went down "],[293.96,"the stairs you were into you know the "],[297.52,"all the old school churches were all "],[299.04,"Built This Way with one open space and "],[301,"then closets for Sunday School classes e "],[303.72,"and we'd stuff the kids and we were just "],[305.88,"on wooden benches stuffed in there and "],[309.08,"that's where they taught me Jesus loves "],[311.8,"me this I know for the Bible tells me so "],[315.6,"and during my childhood that church grew "],[318.44,"so much that we had two different "],[321,"building projects first to add some "],[323.28,"classrooms a nursery a kitchen and a "],[325.2,"foyer so we could get out of the cold "],[328,"and that replaced the old spring door "],[329.72,"with some nice double doors and then the "],[331.44,"second project was they built a new "],[333.44,"Sanctuary uh in a downstairs Fellowship "],[335.92,"Hall and that new Sanctuary could fit "],[338.2,"about 250 people and that all happened "],[341.4,"just during my growing up years I grew "],[344.28,"up in a vibrant Church community the "],[346.8,"people investing in their families the "],[349.24,"people committed to each other's "],[352.04,"spiritual growth the church grew "],[354.16,"numerically but they also grew "],[356.76,"spiritually and from our youth group "],[359.2,"which in the 80s probably had about 30 "],[362.28,"kids four of us came out of that time "],[365.52,"and became full-time pastors I've lost "],[368.32,"track of all of the kids and I know some "],[370.68,"of the some of the young ladies they "],[372.48,"married guys who went into full-time "],[374.52,"Ministry and there were some that went "],[376.16,"into Christian School teachers but I "],[377.96,"know for a fact four of us are still "],[380.08,"pastors today and I think that's quite "],[382.44,"substantial those people in that church "],[385.44,"in that time they made a 15year "],[388.28,"investment into my life and God used "],[391.12,"them to bring me to my calling I didn't "],[395,"just wake up and randomly decide to be a "],[397.28,"pastor there were years of faithful "],[400,"people pouring into me and all of that "],[402.96,"was done to bring glory to God service "],[406,"that people did 50 years ago and I "],[409.08,"remember them and I emulate them all "],[413.12,"these years "],[414.72,"later didn't Daniel Jones do a "],[417.48,"outstanding job last week in the pulpit "],[419.68,"for us he did a great job didn't he "],[422.36,"since the flu had wiped yeah hey there "],[424.64,"you go "],[425.44,"Daniel happy anniversary since the flu "],[428.24,"wiped Pastor Mark out last weekend "],[430.28,"Daniel agreed we he Mark was like man I "],[432.48,"don't know the flu is just wiping out my "],[434.2,"family I'm hope I don't get it I'm "],[436.16,"wiping everything down with sanitizer "],[438.24,"wipes Clorox stock went up last week "],[441.6,"because of Pastor Mark cleaning "],[443,"everything and uh sure enough it took "],[445.08,"him out but we we were smart enough to "],[448,"you know talk call Dan Daniel and he "],[450,"agreed to step in and so Friday he "],[452.28,"popped into the church and I was "],[453.6,"thanking him reflecting on his "],[455.76,"development in his preaching how he's "],[458.04,"grown in that and he reminded me he said "],[460.36,"well you know Pastor I've been listening "],[461.64,"to you for 10 years so that's kind of a "],[464.28,"quite a thing well it's been 10 years "],[466.68,"the fact that he and other young men "],[468.88,"who've grown up here can step into this "],[471.56,"pulpit and rightly divide the word of "],[474.44,"Truth this is a testament to all the "],[477.52,"faithful Ministry that you have done "],[480.84,"that you have been doing glorifying God "],[483.28,"by establishing these young men these "],[485.76,"young believers to pursue God's plans "],[488.24,"for their lives every Sunday our worship "],[491.12,"team is stocked with people who grew up "],[495.96,"here they were just little little kids "],[498.36,"just teenagers when they started and we "],[500.28,"got them up on stage glorifying God and "],[502.76,"now they're so very good at it and uh I "],[506.2,"look at all these young adults and I see "],[508.68,"that the future of Faith Bible Church is "],[511.32,"in very good hands all of our Ministries "],[514.52,"all of them are full of people who are "],[516.44,"once children who are being served and "],[518.8,"now they're serving the Next Generation "],[520.88,"all of our Nursery all of our Sunday "],[522.8,"school up there in our audio visual you "],[525.6,"know Justin Shaner used to just be a "],[527.48,"little guy running around here and then "],[528.92,"I go up there this morning and I'm like "],[530.32,"hello Mr Shaner and he's up there "],[532.24,"serving the lord "],[534.36,"Faithfully the years just keep rolling "],[537.32,"by don't they you just look at your your "],[539.6,"kids and you go man this just where did "],[541.12,"the time go here's Noah and now he's 6' "],[543.24,"one I don't know when did that happen "],[546.84,"that I was really driven home to me in "],[548.64,"Tony's uh wedding this past year but I'm "],[551.96,"confident that if for whatever reason if "],[554.28,"the Lord moved me along this next "],[556.24,"Generation would step up and continue to "],[560.16,"glorify God by sharing the good news of "],[562.72,"Christ establishing Believers to pursue "],[565.52,"God's plans I said at our annual meeting "],[568.4,"none of us will ever know how many lives "],[571.12,"are being changed by these Ministries "],[573.68,"we're never going to hear all of the "],[576,"testimonies so much is being done "],[578.16,"privately especially in our counseling "],[579.72,"Ministries we provide respectful "],[583.76,"confidentiality but you're all doing it "],[587.12,"based on faith you won't know till you "],[589.16,"get to heaven what we've truly been able "],[591.68,"to accomplish and all of our Ministries "],[594.84,"from the kiddos all the way up to our "],[596.76,"missions overseas helping in ways that "],[599,"are impacting people for future "],[601.28,"Generations impacting our culture "],[603.72,"building the kingdom of God one life one "],[607.2,"Soul at a time and your faith is making "],[610.44,"all this possible you know what God will "],[613.72,"reward you for these things all these "],[616.36,"things you did not even know you were a "],[617.8,"part of one day we're going to be a part "],[620.32,"of this heavenly scene Turn to "],[622.4,"Revelation chapter 15 as we see this "],[625.2,"heavenly scene and we get back into our "],[627.44,"study in the Book of Revelation and if "],[628.92,"you knew the this morning or your first "],[630.32,"time here I apologize you just landed in "],[634.64,"a fullblown study of the Book of "],[637.68,"Revelation chapter "],[639.8,"15 pouring out bold judgments on you all "],[644.04,"morning see I wanted to start real "],[646.12,"positive because we're going to get into "],[648.24,"some challenging stuff here in just a "],[651.24,"minute well one day we will be part of "],[653.8,"this scene this amazing scene Revelation "],[656.48,"chapter 15 where we have the "],[659.76,"this whole congregation in heaven verse "],[662.88,"number two and the John writes that I "],[666.56,"saw something like a sea of glass "],[668.84,"mingled with fire and those who have the "],[671.04,"victory over the beasts and over his "],[672.48,"image and over his Mark and over the N "],[674.4,"number of his name standing on the sea "],[676.56,"of glass having harps of God singing the "],[679,"songs of Moses the servant of God and "],[681.2,"the songs of the Lamb what are they "],[683.04,"singing great and marvelous are your "],[685.04,"Works Lord God Almighty just and true "],[687.4,"are your ways oh King of the Saints "],[690,"who shall not fear you oh Lord and "],[691.92,"glorify your name for you alone Are Holy "],[695.2,"and all the nations will come and "],[696.52,"worship before you for your judgments "],[699.24,"have been "],[702.76,"manifest Christmas Eve uh was always so "],[707.36,"much fun to have everyone together in "],[709.72,"one service you know we're always split "],[711.16,"up between the two services but just "],[712.8,"putting everyone together in one service "],[715,"we had over 450 people here on Christmas "],[717.96,"Eve a packed house glorifying God and "],[722.8,"that's as close as we get to this "],[725.04,"heavenly scene here when you have "],[727.8,"everyone and we should aspire to that "],[731.6,"every week here at Faith Bible Church "],[733.84,"every week a packed toast all services "],[736.28,"until everyone understands the good news "],[739,"until everyone in our community is "],[741.4,"pursuing God's purposes for their lives "],[743.96,"one day glorifying God forever in heaven "],[747.24,"that will be our eternal reward and as "],[750.48,"the years fly by I realize that day is "],[753.88,"coming closer and closer we could be "],[757.64,"there together in "],[758.8,"heaven but now John turns our attention "],[762.76,"away from that glorious scene in heaven "],[764.92,"and we resume observing what is "],[767.4,"unfolding on the earth During the sevene "],[770.72,"period known as the Great Tribulation "],[774.04,"this chart summarizes all that we have "],[776.12,"seen the end of the church age the open "],[779.44,"of the seven sealed scroll beginning the "],[781.92,"time the scroll which we learned is the "],[784.48,"title deed of the earth who is worthy to "],[787.92,"take the scroll and open the seals it "],[790.6,"was announced from the throne and the "],[792.6,"answer was the lion of Judah the lamb "],[795.6,"who was slain for the sins of the world "],[797.6,"he is the only one born of woman who "],[800.4,"could take the scroll and reclaim the "],[802.8,"Earth from the evil Empires Satan had "],[806.64,"spawned and in this is the time when "],[809.84,"Satan and all who reject Jesus lordship "],[813.12,"will be evicted from the earth this will "],[816.2,"also be the time when the eyes of so "],[819.24,"many people will be opened up to the "],[821.84,"truth and they will turn to Jesus "],[824.08,"repenting of their sins and will be "],[826.8,"saved as much as I can sing the Praises "],[829.68,"of my little church in New Brunswick "],[831.44,"where I grew up for the number of us who "],[833.32,"went into the ministry I can also rattle "],[835.56,"off the names of many of my peers who "],[837.88,"walked away from church and do not "],[839.84,"believe in Jesus to this day and the "],[841.76,"same is true here I can look around and "],[844.28,"see all of these young men and women who "],[846.24,"grew up here and are now serving but I "],[848.24,"can also tell you a list of those who "],[850.88,"refuse to come and glorify God so we "],[854.12,"continue to pray for them they do not "],[856.2,"lack the "],[857.28,"information they just find it "],[860,"distasteful at this time they deem "],[862.76,"scripture "],[864.32,"unbelievable but that will change when "],[866.92,"they see the sealed judgment "],[869.64,"the trumpet judgments happening before "],[872.24,"their very eyes and that is precisely "],[875.68,"the reason why I need to preach through "],[879.08,"this book people need to have heard all "],[882.56,"about this so that when the Great "],[884.68,"Tribulation begins they will understand "],[887.72,"what's happening all of these "],[891.52,"74 21 judgments have been foretold in "],[896.88,"our holy scriptures our ministry will "],[901.04,"have planted the seeds of the Gospel "],[904.04,"into the hearts of the children so when "],[906.72,"that Great Tribulation begins when the "],[909.04,"prophets and the witnesses and the "],[911.24,"angels during the seven years preach the "],[914,"gospel to the whole world those seeds of "],[916.52,"faith will spring up to a harvest of "],[919.28,"Souls and there will be a great "],[922.6,"Revival but there will also be a "],[926.56,"holocaust of those who do trust in Jesus "],[929.16,"in that time but that need not concern "],[931.76,"us because as the Apostle Paul put it "],[934.52,"for me to live is Christ and to die is "],[939.44,"gain dying will seem like a mercy "],[942.8,"compared to what is going to happen to "],[944.32,"those who dwell on the earth during this "],[947.24,"time Revelation 5 15 verse number five "],[951.8,"after these things I looked and behold "],[953.4,"the Temple of the Tabernacle the "],[954.84,"testimony in heaven was opened and out "],[957,"of the temple came the seven angels "],[958.68,"having the seven plagues clothed in pure "],[961.72,"bright linen having their chest girded "],[964.2,"with golden Bands then one of the four "],[967.24,"living creatures gave to the seven "],[969.8,"angels seven golden bowls full of the "],[973.4,"wrath of God who lives forever and ever "],[976.12,"the temple was filled with the smoke "],[977.48,"from the glory of God and from his power "],[979.28,"no one was able to enter the temple till "],[981.72,"the seven plages of the Seven Angels "],[985.28,"were completed that I heard a loud voice "],[987.64,"chapter 16 from the temple saying to the "],[989.64,"seven angels go pour out the bowls of "],[992.6,"the wrath of God on the "],[994.88,"earth so the first went and poured out "],[997.68,"his bowl upon the earth a foul and lome "],[1001.16,"SAR Came Upon the men who had the mark "],[1003.56,"of the beast and those who worshiped His "],[1006.52,"Image then the second Angel poured out "],[1009.08,"his bowl on the sea and it became blood "],[1012.24,"as of dead men and every living creature "],[1014.64,"in the sea died then the third Angel "],[1017.2,"poured out his bowl on the rivers and "],[1018.64,"the spring waters and they became blood "],[1020.84,"and I heard the angel of the waters "],[1022.56,"saying you are righteous O Lord the one "],[1025.48,"who is and who was and who will be "],[1028.28,"because you have judged these things for "],[1030.8,"they have shed the blood of the Saints "],[1032.88,"and the prophets and you have given them "],[1035.2,"blood to drink for it is their just due "],[1039.32,"and I heard another from the altar "],[1040.8,"saying even so Lord God Almighty true "],[1043.88,"and righteous are your judgments then "],[1046.16,"the fourth Angel poured out his Bull on "],[1047.88,"the Sun the power was given to him to "],[1050.36,"Scorch men with fire and men were "],[1052.68,"scorched with a great "],[1054.48,"heat and they blasphemed the name of God "],[1058.4,"who has power over these plagues and "],[1060.76,"they did not repent and give him "],[1064.4,"glory so here we see the final judgments "],[1068.04,"the wrath of "],[1070.04,"God so the feedback I was getting was "],[1073.48,"everyone enjoyed the Breather from this "],[1077.56,"and our Christmas series where we showed "],[1079.64,"you all the gifts that God has been "],[1081.76,"giving us and you remember all the gifts "],[1084.28,"so just tell me no right one of the "],[1086.6,"gifts was peace remember that one and we "],[1088.64,"talked about the fact that God is so "],[1091.32,"powerful that he could destroy us but "],[1094.16,"instead he wants to be at peace with us "],[1097.08,"and he's offering this gift of peace and "],[1099.68,"we ought to jump at the offer this is "],[1102.6,"not a gift that we should send back some "],[1105.84,"of you open gifts on Christmas and you "],[1108.28,"thought ah I need to I need to send this "],[1111.64,"one back it's not the right size it's "],[1114.88,"what happens when you order from Teemu "],[1116.76,"you just get the wrong "],[1119.24,"size says this doesn't work the way I "],[1121.68,"thought you know it doesn't quite work I "],[1123.48,"got to send this "],[1125.08,"back the gift of peace with God through "],[1128.72,"Jesus the Messiah is not a gift that you "],[1131.8,"should return and here's why right here "],[1134.56,"look at what happens to the people who "],[1136.16,"reject God's "],[1137.48,"peace that he offers them the first bowl "],[1141.52,"is a foul and loome soar two Greek words "],[1147,"both of them are communicating evil you "],[1149.84,"got kacos and you got poros used "],[1153.32,"together they stress the soar is being "],[1157.72,"festering inflamed "],[1162.08,"oozing "],[1164.56,"infected now it's interesting here what "],[1166.68,"did it say the sore was connected to "],[1169.32,"did you see that "],[1172,"detail a foul and lome SAR Came Upon the "],[1175.28,"men who had the mark of the "],[1179,"beast it's connected to those who have "],[1181.52,"the mark of the beast almost as if the "],[1182.96,"mark itself is causing this infection "],[1185.92,"maybe this whatever it is that they put "],[1187.8,"in them this Mark is now uh their bodies "],[1191.24,"are having adverse reaction to it that "],[1193.24,"might be reading a little bit into it uh "],[1195.12,"we do know that uh source is a common "],[1198.32,"plague that has been used in scripture "],[1199.84,"in the past when was that Egypt Exodus "],[1203.48,"right Exodus chapter 9 the Lord said to "],[1205.68,"Moses and Aaron take a handful of Ashes "],[1207.56,"from the furnace and let Moses scatter "],[1209.6,"to the heavens in the sight of pharaoh "],[1211.56,"and it will become Dust In the Land of "],[1213.08,"Egypt and it will cause boils to break "],[1215.4,"out on men and beasts all throughout the "],[1217.56,"land of Egypt so he took the ashes and "],[1219.28,"the furnace and he stood before pharaoh "],[1220.96,"and he threw it into the heavens and it "],[1222.96,"caused boils to break out Soares on men "],[1225.76,"and beasts and The Magicians could not "],[1228,"stand before m mes because of the boils "],[1230.24,"for the boils were on The Magicians they "],[1232.16,"were mimicking and they could do all the "],[1234.04,"things and they couldn't even stand they "],[1235.24,"were full of boils in these oozing "],[1237.8,"festering sores all the plagues of Egypt "],[1241.16,"were to prove to pharaoh and to the "],[1242.88,"Egyptians who really was God Jesus "],[1246.76,"always healed the lepers remember the "],[1249.36,"leprosy was that U those sores that were "],[1251.88,"infected and they were just basically "],[1253.32,"you're decaying your body parts were "],[1255.28,"rotting off and Jesus would heal all "],[1258.2,"these Le lepers proving his divinity God "],[1261.88,"can heal to prove his power and God can "],[1265.48,"take away Health to prove his authority "],[1268.48,"myself I prefer the healing isn't that "],[1270.76,"much better yes good good to get the "],[1273.08,"lesson there the next two bulls they "],[1275.72,"likewise sound like plagues of Egypt "],[1277.48,"don't they the second Bull poured out on "],[1279.4,"the sea and it became as blood of a dead "],[1281.8,"man and every creature in the sea "],[1285.08,"died it's all blood I wonder what that "],[1288.88,"smelt like you know it's nice to go to "],[1291.24,"the water right go to the the the coast "],[1293.56,"going to the OBX but you ever walk down "],[1296.16,"along the beach and uh you get downwind "],[1298.88,"a dead fish right you're walking along "],[1301.64,"so "],[1303.04,"nice trying to figure out where it is "],[1305.32,"and get it around it one time we were in "],[1307.24,"Delaware was Bethany Beach and uh a big "],[1311.2,"old sea turtle was dead and it washed up "],[1314.28,"on the beach and the whole place was "],[1317.84,"just re "],[1319.4,"and they had to get a bobcat down there "],[1321.72,"to pick that thing up it was so big and "],[1323.48,"dig it out of there and um you know "],[1326.32,"everybody like all the all the people "],[1328.36,"that live on the beach and all the shop "],[1329.88,"owners were like get that dead turtle "],[1332.8,"out of here it's stinking everything up "],[1335.12,"because it's driving people away "],[1336.08,"everybody just runs away from that space "],[1338.68,"imagine all the sea life dead and "],[1342.6,"washing up on every "],[1344.12,"Shoreline that's what's going to happen "],[1346.6,"here third Bowl "],[1349.52,"same thing only this time it's the what "],[1352.76,"the rivers and the spring water and it "],[1355,"becomes like "],[1356.44,"blood what happens when all the water is "],[1359.2,"taken away now you got to remember to to "],[1362.08,"build on the previous "],[1365.16,"uh the previous bowls right because the "],[1368.12,"first Bowl was the sores right so "],[1372.2,"everyone has these oozing festering "],[1374.24,"sores and nothing can be washed because "],[1378.56,"all the water's gone so everyone's dirty "],[1381.36,"and smelly and covered in infection and "],[1384.24,"nothing can be cleaned and then what "],[1386.16,"else when you don't have any "],[1387.76,"water kind of need that to live e you "],[1390.04,"got you need water to drink and they can "],[1393.36,"only have blood to drink and the reasons "],[1395.84,"given what was the reason given in verse "],[1398.96,"six for they shed the blood of the "],[1401.4,"Saints and the prophets and you've given "],[1403.6,"them blood to drink for it is their just "],[1406.6,"due "],[1408.56,"we we sometimes use that expression "],[1410.88,"bloodthirsty to describe someone who is "],[1413.36,"vicious and murderous like you know a "],[1415.64,"blood thirsty "],[1417.6,"pirate meaning they enjoy murder and it "],[1420.4,"excites them instead of pity or remorse "],[1423.08,"for taking the life they have the "],[1424.76,"opposite emotion and this is not a good "],[1427.68,"emotion to Foster and cultivate "],[1429.6,"nevertheless it has always been a part "],[1431.44,"of the sinful human nature to love "],[1434.76,"violence and to be excited by brutality "],[1438.12,"the entertainment in the ancient "],[1440.28,"Coliseum in Rome looks a lot like our "],[1443.76,"modern day movies and video games now we "],[1447.6,"give ourselves a pass and we'll say well "],[1449.16,"Rome they're far worse because they were "],[1451.2,"literally feeding people to live animals "],[1454.4,"they were literally watching Gladiators "],[1456.88,"fight to the death for fun ours is just "],[1459.24,"acting you know it's just fake it's make "],[1461.76,"believe true but we do feed this Blood "],[1465.2,"lust even in the pretending so when the "],[1468.68,"Antichrist brings the executions during "],[1471.84,"the tribulation and they're executing "],[1473.64,"the prophets and the Saints people are "],[1476.12,"conditioned to accept it they take "],[1478.64,"pleasure in killing the saints of God "],[1481.6,"which is why God is giving them only "],[1484.04,"blood to drink to match their "],[1486.96,"bloodthirsty passions that does not "],[1489.4,"sound sound very thirst quencing does it "],[1492.36,"just to have blood as opposed to what "],[1495.84,"Jesus promises to give us for our thirst "],[1498.8,"John 4 verse number 13 Jesus answered "],[1502.88,"and said to her whoever drinks this "],[1505.92,"water will thirst again but whoever "],[1508.04,"drinks the water that I give them will "],[1510.24,"never thirst but the water that I give "],[1513.04,"will become in him a fountain of water "],[1515.96,"springing up to everlasting life that's "],[1519.2,"what he offers you this morning for your "],[1521.12,"thirsty Soul Revelation 21 verse number "],[1524.12,"6 and he said to me it is done I am the "],[1527.6,"alpha the Omega of the beginning and the "],[1529.28,"end and I will give of the Fountain of "],[1532.16,"the Water of Life freely to all who "],[1536.6,"thirst rejecting God's peace has serious "],[1540.44,"consequences doesn't it nothing to drink "],[1544.48,"fourth "],[1545.88,"bow we now compound that with the sun "],[1549.52,"heating up scorching men with fire "],[1552.96,"scorching with great heat "],[1556.44,"so when you're got a burn what do you "],[1559.96,"need all my nurses how do you how do you "],[1562.32,"treat a burn cold water right you got to "],[1565.28,"get cold water on well there's no water "],[1567.68,"there's just stinking blood that's all "],[1569.28,"you "],[1570.08,"have but notice the reaction of the "],[1572.36,"people I think this is very telling I "],[1574.52,"want you to not miss this so men were "],[1577.8,"scorched verse nine with a great heat "],[1580.36,"and they what does it say blaspheme the "],[1584,"name of God who has power over these "],[1586,"plagues they did not repent and give him "],[1592.32,"glory our Christmas Eve service is so "],[1595.84,"much more than a nice Christmas "],[1599.48,"tradition it is the children of God's "],[1603.4,"time to come and "],[1607.32,"glorify there really is no other "],[1609.64,"activity that's more important than "],[1611.6,"glorifying God so I started in chapter "],[1614.44,"15 because I wanted to contrast What's "],[1616.64,"Happening Here chapter 15 15 verse "],[1618.8,"number four here's the Saints in heaven "],[1621.08,"around the Throne of God and what are "],[1623.12,"they saying verse number four chapter "],[1625.04,"154 who shall not fear oh Lord and "],[1629.32,"what glorify your name who will not fear "],[1632.92,"and glorify your name and the answer to "],[1634.96,"that question chapter 16 verse number "],[1637.6,"eight they pour out the Sun the power to "],[1640.08,"Scorch men verse 9 they Scorch them with "],[1642.08,"heat they what blasphemed God's name and "],[1645.8,"they did not repent and they did not "],[1647.44,"give him "],[1650.56,"Glory I love how the hym writer states "],[1654.52,"the desire oh for a thousand tongues to "],[1658.52,"sing I need a thousand tongues my great "],[1662.32,"redeemer's praise the glories of my God "],[1664.2,"and King the triumphs of his grace he's "],[1666.92,"expressing I need more tongues to "],[1668.88,"Proclaim all the praise due to God "],[1671.8,"second verse my gracious master and my "],[1673.8,"God assist me he's praying assist me God "],[1676.8,"assist me to Proclaim to spread to all "],[1679,"the Earth abroad the honors of your name "],[1681.36,"everyone's got to hear this message "],[1682.72,"everyone needs to hear the name of Jesus "],[1685.24,"Jesus the name that charms our fears "],[1687.48,"that brings our sorrow cease is music in "],[1690.04,"the sinner's ears is life and health and "],[1692.44,"peace Jesus why what did he do fourth "],[1695.48,"verse he breaks the power of canceled "],[1697.72,"sin he sets the prisoner free his blood "],[1701.12,"can make the foulest clean his blood "],[1703.64,"avails for me this is the good news I "],[1706.84,"got to sing it I got to shouted oh for a "],[1709.84,"thousand tongues to "],[1712,"sing "],[1713.68,"meanwhile these people here have one "],[1716.68,"tongue and they'd sooner nod off than "],[1720.08,"glorify God instead of repenting they "],[1724.24,"blaspheme and that is why this is all "],[1727.52,"got to be drawn to a close God's final "],[1730.08,"judgment has to come these people are "],[1734.24,"unredeemable they know what's going on "],[1736.92,"they know that this is God God's Wrath "],[1738.6,"being poured out on them and they know "],[1740.4,"why because of their evil deeds and they "],[1742.6,"will not "],[1746.24,"repent there are people here today who "],[1749.16,"do not repent because they're "],[1751.08,"unconvinced they're not sure there is a "],[1753.68,"God they're not sure if there's a heaven "],[1756.2,"or a hell they're not sure if they're "],[1758.32,"really that bad what do I what do I need "],[1759.84,"to repent of there's a lot of uninformed "],[1764.04,"and Confused people and God wants us to "],[1767.52,"share with them serve them in kindness "],[1771.44,"communicate the message of the Salvation "],[1774.04,"and the hope of eternal life the hope of "],[1777.28,"eternal life because we all know we're "],[1779.28,"going to die one day we're all going to "],[1781.96,"die but there is a hope of glory and God "],[1785,"is not willing that any should perish "],[1786.8,"but that all come to "],[1790.52,"repentance so often what happens is "],[1794.36,"people hear the gospel and since they're "],[1795.84,"doubtful they just remain skeptically "],[1799.6,"unbelieving I don't know but then as is "],[1803.4,"always the case here comes some pain "],[1807.4,"suffering the chaos it's out there "],[1811.6,"happens to us all it humbles us it "],[1814.84,"reveals to us our deficiencies our "],[1817.24,"weaknesses and in that Dark Night of the "],[1820.08,"Soul that's usually when we cry out to "],[1822.88,"help we cry out for the help and Jesus "],[1825.8,"answers he saves us "],[1828.52,"that's the reoccurring theme of the "],[1830.52,"entire nation of Israel all throughout "],[1832.4,"the Old Testament they get into sin they "],[1834.44,"get into a mess they cry out for help "],[1837.28,"God restores them and that's the message "],[1839.76,"of Jesus come unto me all you who are "],[1842.36,"weary and burdened down and I will I'll "],[1845.12,"give you "],[1846.2,"rest Jesus is the Fortress the place of "],[1849.36,"protection he's called The Rock Jesus "],[1852.56,"says the wise man builds his house on "],[1855.04,"the rock and when the storms of life "],[1857.64,"come his house his life will not "],[1860.48,"collapse meanwhile the foolish man "],[1862.16,"builds his house on the sand so when the "],[1864.56,"storms of life hit "],[1866.76,"you their life "],[1868.72,"collapses the storms will come so all "],[1873.04,"the old people will give me an Amen on "],[1874.6,"that right the chaos is coming the pain "],[1877.92,"The Dark Night of the Soul comes for us "],[1880.08,"all and in that moment the best thing "],[1882,"you can do is just cry out to Jesus for "],[1884.16,"help but when the fifth bowl is poured "],[1886.64,"out in its complete darkness all these "],[1888.8,"people do is wallow in their pain and "],[1891.2,"they blaspheme that is a Greek word it "],[1893.76,"is a transliteration blaso it means to "],[1897.28,"revile to speak evil of to "],[1901.96,"curse and they show no glory to God they "],[1906,"only curse him so this is why I would "],[1908.72,"conclude that these people are "],[1909.76,"unredeemable because the only way to be "],[1911.48,"saved is to repent and cry out to God "],[1914.88,"for help and they do just the opposite "],[1918.68,"it when I was in a dark and scary place "],[1922.8,"when everything in my life was going to "],[1924.08,"be destroyed I cried out to God I knew "],[1927.12,"to cry out to God because I was taught "],[1929.16,"the words I was taught the verses I was "],[1931.48,"taught the theology it was in my head "],[1933.72,"and it got down to my heart real fast "],[1935.96,"got down to my heart it got out my mouth "],[1937.64,"and I repented and I recited Jesus saved "],[1941.44,"me because I learned so long ago Jesus "],[1945.24,"loves me as I know the good news is "],[1948.8,"God's word declares whosoever calls upon "],[1951.84,"the name of the Lord shall be saved so "],[1954.96,"these people here in Revelation 16 they "],[1956.72,"could be saved but they won't be saved "],[1958.68,"because they won't call on the name of "],[1960.32,"Jesus to save them they'll only "],[1964.16,"blaspheme "],[1965.96,"2024 had some great times and it had "],[1968.12,"some hard times like every year there's "],[1970.56,"joy and there's pain I didn't always "],[1973.16,"communicate very well on a few occasions "],[1974.92,"my tongue got me into trouble I'm sure "],[1977.44,"you know who I get in trouble with with "],[1978.84,"my "],[1979.6,"Tong for the most part I had many "],[1982.84,"opportunities to glorify God and I took "],[1986.72,"them when the pain came I prayed and God "],[1990.76,"helped "],[1992.08,"me none of us nobody in here is going to "],[1995.44,"be perfect in "],[1996.92,"2025 you shocked to hear that none of us "],[2000.64,"we will sin offend worry curse we will "],[2005.64,"struggle and we will fall "],[2008.8,"but you can always choose to come back "],[2010.16,"and worship you can always come here "],[2012.48,"every Sunday and "],[2014.08,"glorify a new year approaches and I "],[2016.88,"wonder what will you do when the pain "],[2020.08,"the darkness comes will you curse God "],[2023.12,"for it and not gnaw your tongue in pain "],[2025.48,"or will you use your tongue to recite "],[2027.68,"the promises that can bring you the "],[2029.64,"healing you need the Living Water to "],[2031.76,"quench your thirst the cleansing that "],[2033.6,"you need from unrighteousness 2025 will "],[2036.24,"give plenty of opportunities to glorify "],[2038.48,"God or blaspheme God it will be my goal "],[2042.68,"it'll be Pastor Mark's goal the "],[2044.76,"spiritual leaders the staff of Faith "],[2046.48,"Bible Church our goal will be to provide "],[2048.8,"you and your family a place to come and "],[2050.8,"glorify God every week and it will be "],[2053.88,"our hope and prayer that we will be "],[2055.96,"packed full every week of families and "],[2058.48,"friends ready willing and able to "],[2061.2,"worship and pray and serve our great God "],[2065.04,"and Savior Jesus Christ Lord we pray "],[2068.84,"that that will happen here in 2025 that "],[2072.12,"we will all use our tongues to glorify "],[2075.6,"you to praise you to give you all the "],[2078.88,"glory and honor and worship that you so "],[2081.4,"deserve one day we will be part of that "],[2083.68,"scene in heaven and we do look forward "],[2085.52,"to that day even as we think of loved "],[2087.4,"ones who are already there doing that "],[2089.04,"and we long to be with them Lord we pray "],[2091.4,"that we will be faithful and we'll be "],[2092.84,"devoted and we'll be committed to "],[2094.52,"honoring you and serving you and getting "],[2096.68,"that good news that hope of eternal life "],[2099.88,"that hope of the Gospel out to a broken "],[2102.2,"needy world people in their times of "],[2104.12,"Darkness people in their times of chaos "],[2106.04,"that they will know that you are there "],[2107.88,"you love them and you heal them and may "],[2110.36,"they come before it's too late Lord we "],[2112.8,"just pray for a Revival we pray for a "],[2114.92,"packed house we pray for every church "],[2117.36,"that they stand up in preach thus sayeth "],[2119.92,"the Lord everyone to be full everyone to "],[2122.6,"be filled in a great moving in our land "],[2124.88,"we pray all this in Jesus name amen "]]},{"id":"UggUnPba2l0","name":"2025-01-05  Title (Pastor Rob McNutt)","date":"2025-01-05","transcript":[[19.36,"invite you to take your copy of the word "],[21.04,"of God and turn to Revelation chapter 16 "],[26.4,"as we continue on back into our study of "],[29.32,"the Book of Revelation we are in verse "],[30.88,"number 12 Revelation "],[33.56,"16:12 Paul John writes then the six "],[36.84,"Angel poured out his bowl on the river "],[39.64,"Euphrates and the water was dried up so "],[42.68,"that the way of the Kings from the East "],[45.32,"might be prepared and I saw three "],[49.44,"unclean spirits like frogs coming out of "],[52.76,"the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth "],[54.56,"of the Beast and out of the mouth of the "],[56,"false prophet for they are spirits of "],[58.4,"demons performing "],[60.64,"which go out to the kings of the earth "],[63.16,"and of the whole world to gather them to "],[66.24,"the Battle of that great day of God "],[69.24,"Almighty behold I come I am coming as a "],[72.56,"thief blessed is He Who Watches and "],[75.08,"keeps his garments lest he walk naked "],[77.44,"and see his they see his shame and they "],[80.36,"gathered them together to the place "],[82.28,"called in Hebrew "],[84.96,"Armageddon that's five verses loaded "],[87.92,"with information the six bold judgment "],[91.92,"the Bold judgments are the final seven "],[94.84,"judgments God is pouring out on the "],[96.68,"world in the seven-year "],[99.72,"tribulation first uh bold judgment was "],[102.88,"horrible sores broke out on everyone who "],[105.12,"took the mark of the beast the second uh "],[108.24,"Bowl was the oceans were turned to dead "],[112.2,"man's blood and all the sea life dies "],[115.16,"the third bowl is all the fresh water "],[117.72,"the spring waters turn to blood and as "],[120.08,"well the fourth bold the sun was poured "],[124.2,"out on the sun and it became intensely "],[126,"hot and scorches the earth and the "],[128.56,"people fifth one was the Antichrist "],[131.28,"kingdom was plunged Into Darkness "],[134.56,"Darkness is a curse people can't do "],[137.56,"anything when it is dark now normally we "],[139.76,"don't worry about Darkness because we "],[141.48,"have oh lights right electricity and all "],[144,"of our cities and buildings are well lit "],[145.96,"and we drive at night no problem the "],[148.92,"only time we have we have to be in the "],[151.72,"dark is when we choose to be in the dark "],[154.32,"and we just turn the lights out and go "],[155.64,"to bed so there for there to be darkness "],[160.24,"that "],[160.96,"means the power grid has to have gone "],[163.52,"down right so there's no electricity and "],[165.68,"nothing's "],[166.64,"working um I thought of maybe like an "],[169.36,"EMP attack would do something like that "],[171.24,"right knock out all the electricity and "],[172.88,"all the technology uh but this bold "],[175.32,"Judgment of darkness is communicating "],[177.2,"its just not at night if it's also "],[180.4,"darkness in the day now that would be "],[182.4,"terribly unsettling we depend on Sunrise "],[185.32,"to Mark our days the sun is the center "],[187.4,"of our universe and it's one of the most "],[189.6,"powerful forces that we can relate to "],[191.56,"the sun dwarfs everything it outshines "],[194.04,"all other celestial bodies so it would "],[196.56,"be incredibly concerning to realize "],[198.48,"something's wrong with the "],[200.24,"sun it's a very effective way for God to "],[203.24,"Showcase his power to communicate to the "],[206.16,"people in the Antichrist Kingdom that he "],[209.04,"is God "],[210.32,"and their leader is not by taking away "],[213.88,"the light of the Sun so those are the "],[216.12,"bull judgments that we covered last week "],[218.08,"now onto the sixth Bowl which has a very "],[222.16,"unique reason behind it the river "],[224.84,"Euphrates is dried up that's the Bold "],[227.76,"judgment for the express purpose of the "],[231.2,"Nations to come to the final battle all "],[235.16,"right let's get into that first of all "],[236.6,"the drying up of the river Euphrates "],[238.36,"that in and of itself would be "],[240.16,"astounding to John's first century "],[242.4,"audience cuz the river Euphrates has "],[244.32,"been around since the dawn of creation "],[247,"first mentioned in Genesis chapter 2 "],[249.32,"when civilization was born that River "],[251.76,"was there when Noah's sons came off the "],[253.92,"ark they followed the river Euphrates "],[255.92,"down at of turkey to The Plains of "],[257.64,"shinar and built the first postf flood "],[260.56,"kingdoms the great Empire of Babylon was "],[263.28,"built on the banks of the river "],[265.28,"Euphrates it acted as a natural border "],[267.72,"between East and West it's the most "],[270,"essential River in the ancient world the "],[272.8,"river fredes is dried up "],[275.64,"impossible you think let me show you a "],[278.68,"video Iraq is oil Rich for their country "],[281.24,"is plagued by poverty after Decades of "],[283.64,"War drought and desertification adding "],[286.04,"more to the disaster the fact is that "],[288.2,"the river you say watered the biblical "],[289.88,"Garden of Eden is found to be slowly "],[291.92,"drying up drought in the Euphrates River "],[295,"has been a phenomenon with a lot of "],[296.72,"religious "],[297.8,"backing however when the ible says "],[300.56,"particular things will happen it doesn't "],[302.64,"tell if it's due to Nature or because of "],[304.88,"man's politics or "],[306.68,"industry they happened one of Western "],[309.08,"Asia is most essential and longest "],[311.32,"rivers is the Euphrates it originates in "],[313.84,"turkey and travels through the southeast "],[315.84,"mountains and Southern foothills of the "],[317.8,"area before flowing into Syria and Iraq "],[320.44,"and a variety of vegetation before "],[322.6,"emptying into the Persian Gulf a "],[325.48,"satellite photo has shocked everyone "],[327.76,"even scientists were surprised to see "],[329.72,"see this River drying up so quickly "],[332.6,"while this image is from 2021 when the "],[335.16,"Euphrates River was full but now look at "],[337.68,"this picture it is recorded by Google "],[339.88,"Earth in "],[341.36,"2023 the Euphrates river is almost "],[344.04,"completely drying up this is the Anna "],[347.12,"Tower in Iraq you can see the Anna tower "],[350.4,"has show off "],[351.72,"completely it is the measures of the "],[353.84,"waters in the region but now it is left "],[356.16,"without water around it from this "],[358.04,"picture you can tell that the euph fres "],[360,"river is dying now soon it will be the "],[362.44,"river without water actually it is not "],[365.48,"river it is called haditha Dam it's the "],[368.64,"largest dam on Euphrates rivers in Iraq "],[372.16,"and you see if this tower has completely "],[374.12,"show up and the waters is very little "],[377.12,"left there are many peoples are pumping "],[379.68,"water from the river for their supply "],[382.08,"they pump the water to their homes and "],[384.04,"their agriculture use we can see the "],[386.32,"water quality from this river is very "],[388.36,"bad and this is very unsafe to drink "],[390.76,"they will suffer from diarrhea and "],[392.44,"various kind of diseases if they consume "],[394.6,"the water many reason have completely "],[397.6,"drying up in this area was once a "],[399.8,"fertile area and farmers can grow "],[402.28,"various kinds of crops here now it has "],[404.96,"become a Barron desert that is "],[406.6,"impossible to grow any "],[410.76,"team so it's not officially completely "],[413.76,"dried up but it's well on its way John "],[418.08,"says it's drying up for a particular "],[420.48,"reason verse 13 though that the way of "],[422.92,"the kings of the East might be prepared "],[425.84,"who are the kings of the east in "],[427.72,"scripture the east of course refers to "],[429.96,"any geographical country east of Israel "],[434.32,"uh here's a little map for you and the "],[437.36,"red line is the river Euphrates I know I "],[440.08,"should have drew it blue but I wanted to "],[441.68,"really pop by the way do you like did "],[443.36,"you notice that the screens are "],[445,"bigger nobody noticed we put up some "],[447.56,"bigger screens there's a 15 more more "],[449.64,"inches up there a for you to see and I "],[452.24,"just thought I'd throw slides and videos "],[453.84,"at you so I could test run them all "],[455.64,"right back to the map okay so the river "],[457.48,"your fredes is there in the red and I "],[459.56,"notice the uh just some of the countries "],[462.2,"to the East are marked in yellow uh Iran "],[465.92,"being the one that we hear the most "],[467.92,"about uh because it's always hostile to "],[470.44,"Israel when the biblical authors say "],[473.2,"East they're always talking about "],[475.12,"typically Babylon Persia of course Iran "],[477.56,"is Persia and then further into to the "],[479.76,"Asian continent but I thought I'd give "],[481.12,"you a bigger view of other uh kings that "],[483.76,"might be east of this River over here "],[486.88,"these countries are all east of uh the "],[490,"river Euphrates and I underlined some of "],[493.32,"them for you now technically Russia "],[494.96,"would' be considered the nation to the "],[497.36,"north but many of these Eastern "],[499.48,"countries are Muslim nations not known "],[501.96,"for their peaceful attitudes towards "],[504.64,"Israel also we have China and India huge "],[507.96,"populations in those countri countries "],[510.32,"with uh aspirations of global dominance "],[513.04,"and then of course we got the uh little "],[515.6,"hermit nation of North Korea I circled "],[517.88,"them all the way over there simply "],[519.4,"because they have nuclear capabilities "],[521.08,"and they don't play well with others all "],[523.72,"of these nations are ones that really do "],[526.4,"not Ally themselves with us Western "],[529.12,"countries however this is not West "],[530.92,"versus East during the tribulation no "],[533.96,"all of these countries all of them are "],[536.16,"being drawn to Israel to join the "],[539,"Antichrist Christ for this one great "],[541.48,"battle they gathered together verse 16 "],[543.96,"says to the place in Hebrew called "],[546.72,"Armageddon the word Armageddon is used "],[549.4,"generically today to refer to any type "],[552.52,"of catastrophic conflict that's might "],[555.44,"result in destruction or a lot of people "],[558.16,"dying or we use the words like "],[560.96,"Armageddon and apocalypse to talk about "],[564.48,"things that we might think are you know "],[567.24,"going to be somewhat "],[570.32,"disturbing like snow mageddon you know "],[573.64,"three to five inches of snow it's snow "],[576.04,"mageddon all right guys it's not going "],[578.12,"to be that "],[579.52,"bad 3 to five inches of snow is every "],[583.4,"Tuesday in Canada from October to may "],[588.08,"not a big deal we'll survive it but we "],[591.08,"use those words a lot when we want to "],[593.08,"kind of like really talk like woo this "],[596,"is going to be really rough in in "],[598.36,"Revelation Armageddon is not just oh it "],[601.96,"might be somewhat of a challenge no it "],[604.96,"is the climactic battle between Jesus "],[610.72,"and all the rest of the nations in the "],[613.16,"world that are following the Antichrist "],[615.2,"that is the only appropriate use of the "],[617.88,"word Armageddon the word ultimately "],[620.4,"comes from the Hebrew word har magido "],[623,"which means Mount megiddo or the "],[625.44,"predicted location of the battle the "],[627.88,"exact location of Armageddon is is "],[629.4,"unclear since there is no Mount called "],[631.8,"megiddo however since har in the Hebrew "],[634.48,"means Hill the most likely location is "],[636.84,"the Hill Country surrounding the plains "],[638.76,"of mehto and I showed you another yet "],[641.48,"another slide with arrows pointing to "],[644.16,"exactly where that Valley is it's also "],[648.16,"called the valley of Jezreel it's a "],[651.44,"valley in the northern part of the "],[652.92,"country of Israel 20 mil long and about "],[655.64,"7 miles wide Napoleon bonapart you know "],[659.12,"that that name from history he stood in "],[660.92,"the valley of magto and remarked that "],[662.48,"all the armies of the world could "],[663.84,"maneuver their forces in this vast plane "],[666.76,"now that was for his time I don't think "],[668.56,"that would apply to all the armies of "],[670.36,"the world now but during the past 4,000 "],[673.2,"years at least 34 bloody conflicts have "],[676.64,"already been fought in that ancient site "],[679.32,"of megiddo and in the jezel valley the "],[682.36,"Egyptians the Canaanites the Israelites "],[684.04,"the midianites the amalekites the "],[685.4,"Philistines Hans Greeks Romans Muslims "],[689.32,"Crusaders Mongol French ottoman British "],[692.96,"Australians Germans Arabs and modern day "],[696.08,"Israelis have all fought and died in "],[698.32,"that spot megiddo was the site of the "],[702.76,"battle with the Arabs in the Israeli War "],[705.64,"in "],[706.72,"1948 why why is there so many battles "],[709.76,"being fought in that one "],[711.6,"place because whoever controls megiddo "],[715.96,"had control of one of the major trade "],[718.52,"routes of Antiquities known as The Way "],[721.4,"of the sea this ancient Highway winds "],[724.8,"its way directly through Israel right "],[727.64,"past megiddo in the valley of jzer this "],[731.76,"jel this strategic placed Road ran "],[734.96,"between Egypt to the South and "],[738.2,"Mesopotamia to the east following up and "],[741.36,"around down through the river Euphrates "],[743.84,"and then also going up north to modern "],[746.8,"day turkey and going on into Europe so "],[751.92,"it's the crossroads of the ancient world "],[755.16,"and virtually every invading Army that "],[757.44,"came into this region during the past "],[759.28,"4,000 years fought to control megiddo in "],[762.08,"the jezriel valley there's also a river "],[765.08,"in that Valley it's called the Kishon "],[767.24,"River and uh some of you Sunday school "],[769.4,"teachers might remember the name of that "],[771.48,"because several uh scriptural battles "],[775.52,"biblical battles were fought there that "],[777.04,"were very important to our Old Testament "],[780.32,"we had the Battle of uh the judge Barack "],[784.12,"and Deborah fought and beat the "],[785.8,"Canaanites in that very Valley and then "],[788.08,"Gideon won the victory over the "],[789.92,"midianites in that Valley also uh if you "],[793.44,"see in the red I uh highlighted to the "],[796.44,"left the uh Mount Carmel and what "],[799.72,"happened on Mount Carmel you remember "],[802.16,"from First Kings chapter 18 was the "],[804.28,"showdown between Elijah and the prophets "],[807.56,"of Baal and of course course you "],[809.44,"remember after God won that Showdown and "],[813.28,"lit the altar on fire and proved "],[815.56,"everybody who the true God was all the "],[817.72,"prophets of Baal got marched down to the "],[819.52,"river Kishon and all you s school "],[821.52,"teachers remember what happened there "],[822.72,"right they all got slaughtered at the "],[826.32,"river so uh it's very interesting I also "],[829.76,"learned that the river Kishon in Arabic "],[833.96,"is translated River of Slaughter or "],[838.04,"dismemberment so I thought that was very "],[840.84,"telling uh since that's what's happened "],[843,"there in the past so many times and it's "],[845.16,"what will happen in the future at the "],[847.36,"Battle of our mageddon now there's "],[850.12,"another underlined in red I don't know "],[852.84,"if you can read it it's a little town "],[855.4,"that you might recognize the name of "],[858.64,"Nazareth that's also right on the uh "],[861.56,"boundaries there Nazareth and what's "],[863.84,"that place famous "],[866.44,"for it's where Jesus is from right so I "],[869.32,"thought that was very interesting how "],[872.08,"all the nations of the world come to "],[873.56,"face off against Jesus in the very "],[875.36,"region that he would have grown up as a "],[879,"child so chapter 16 is telling us how "],[881.88,"all the nations are preparing for battle "],[883.68,"and that battle is going to take place "],[885.24,"in actually chapter 19 so I wanted you "],[888.64,"to to understand that right now from "],[891.44,"chapter 16 17 18 and 19 this is all like "],[896.72,"condensed happening all together but the "],[899.4,"problem with Pastor Rob as he preaches "],[901.08,"through all these chapters is going to "],[902.56,"take Pastor "],[904.48,"Rob the rest of the year I don't know "],[907.04,"how long it's going to take me to preach "],[909,"through those chapters but we have to "],[910.84,"try to remember that this is all "],[912.72,"happening all at once all in real time "],[915.04,"this is all really rapid fire so bear "],[917.8,"with me is I can't really preach it all "],[919.96,"in one shot but uh I'm sure you couldn't "],[922.76,"help notice the detail John gives "],[925.84,"explaining what is influencing the kings "],[927.8,"of the East to come "],[929.48,"join the Antichrist to fight this battle "],[932.16,"what was that verse number 13 I saw "],[935.52,"three unclean spirits like frogs coming "],[938.52,"out of the mouth of the Dragon the mouth "],[940.44,"of the Beast and the mouth of the fral "],[942.52,"Prophet for they are spirits of demons "],[945.32,"performing signs which go out to the "],[947.52,"kings of the earth and the whole world "],[949.28,"Gathering them for the battle of the "],[950.88,"great day of God "],[952.76,"Almighty demon frogs what what is John "],[958.16,"talking about "],[960.4,"so if you it's your first Sunday at "],[962.64,"Faith Bible "],[963.88,"Church this might sound really weird "],[966.52,"like nothing you hear "],[968.44,"normally in a church on Sunday morning "],[972.4,"for people who have been attending here "],[973.8,"for the last 10 months you're like o oh "],[976.48,"I I think I know what this is all about "],[978.76,"and for anyone who's been around here "],[980.4,"for any length of time say over a year "],[982.52,"you're like demon frogs that sounds like "],[985.6,"any normal sermon at Faith Bible "],[989.6,"Church okay so something to remind "],[993.04,"everyone God is a supernatural being and "],[997.76,"the Bible whose author is the holy "],[1000.24,"spirit is the one book that gives "],[1003.44,"Humanity accurate information about the "],[1007.28,"supernatural therefore we take the Bible "],[1011.32,"literally if you've been with us for a "],[1013.64,"couple of months you'll remember these "],[1016.72,"characters the dragon the Beast and the "],[1020,"false prophet you know who they are if "],[1022.28,"you don't know or you don't remember "],[1023.8,"then go back to our YouTube channel and "],[1026.12,"watch September 29th October 6th and "],[1029.76,"October 13th watch all those three "],[1032.88,"sermons and they will explain in detail "],[1035.48,"the dragon the Beast and the false "],[1037.24,"prophet I can't get into all the details "],[1039,"I'll give you the summary the dragon in "],[1041.8,"scripture has many names the devil Satan "],[1045.52,"Lucifer the serpent he's one of the "],[1048.16,"greatest angel that God ever created but "],[1051.04,"he rebelled against God and he led "],[1053.28,"onethird of all the angels in heaven "],[1055.48,"with him there was a war in heaven and "],[1057.52,"the devil lost and onethird of the "],[1059.08,"angels and he were cast to the Earth he "],[1062.48,"knows he can't overpower God but he's "],[1064.88,"still trying to oppose God how's he "],[1067.2,"doing this well the Bible teaches us a "],[1069.64,"great deal about Satan he's called our "],[1072.2,"adversary we when we study him we "],[1074.6,"realize what his strategy is he's trying "],[1078.12,"to get some something God declared in "],[1080.36,"his word to not come to pass God has "],[1083.96,"declared that his word is truth and all "],[1086.92,"that he has spoken will be fulfilled God "],[1090.16,"has spoken many things to mankind he has "],[1092.88,"made promises he has made covenants to "],[1096.24,"people this is where the devil's taking "],[1098.76,"the fight if he can get the promises "],[1101.04,"that God has made to people to not come "],[1103.52,"true then he can prove that God is a "],[1106.44,"liar which means God has sinned which "],[1108.8,"means he's not holy or perfect which "],[1110.64,"means the decrees that God made about "],[1113,"Satan could possibly not come true "],[1116.36,"that's the big Cosmic chess match that's "],[1120.04,"being played out all throughout human "],[1122.76,"history most people are oblivious to any "],[1126.04,"of this they do not have spiritual "],[1129.08,"understanding they think all that is is "],[1131.6,"the physical world and they're skeptical "],[1134.28,"about other dimensions that they cannot "],[1136.56,"see taste touch smell or feel they don't "],[1142.6,"think about them some people do have "],[1146.44,"understanding lots of people have "],[1148.12,"understanding of the spiritual Dimension "],[1149.96,"but there's a great deal of confusion on "],[1151.88,"the topic and that's because the devil's "],[1154.24,"a liar and the evil spirits are "],[1156.4,"deceptive and they have an agenda that "],[1158.56,"they're working non-stop to accomplish "],[1160.8,"so even the people who are aware and "],[1162.92,"interested in the spirit world many of "],[1164.92,"them are misled and even being used by "],[1166.96,"Satan for his goals which is to somehow "],[1169.68,"prevent God's word from coming true and "],[1171.92,"then last but not least there are those "],[1174.04,"of us who have a pretty good "],[1176.04,"understanding of what is going on in the "],[1177.4,"spirit world and how it impacts the "],[1179.08,"physical world how do we know because "],[1181.72,"God told us what is going on and his "],[1184.88,"word is true and it keeps being proven "],[1187.4,"true all throughout history I showed you "],[1190.88,"an example of something we're seeing "],[1192.92,"taking place even before our very eyes "],[1196.2,"2,000 years ago John writes the river "],[1198.8,"fres is going to dry up and that sounded "],[1200.72,"impossible to John and to the people "],[1202.96,"2,000 years ago and yet today the r "],[1206.4,"fredes is drying up God's word coming "],[1210.56,"true before our very eyes go home and "],[1213.6,"Google it if you don't believe me or my "],[1216.88,"video well I did it's not my video I "],[1218.8,"didn't make it I can explain to you "],[1221.16,"pretty much everything that is going on "],[1224.36,"in the world because I know the future "],[1227.4,"I've been teaching you the future for "],[1228.84,"the last 10 months and I got six "],[1230.76,"chapters left so the dragon is saan and "],[1235,"he raises up the Antichrist also known "],[1237.72,"as the Beast the Antichrist is a human "],[1241.68,"being who rules the final world Empire "],[1245.6,"Satan has always raised up Empires given "],[1248.08,"them power and tried to use them to "],[1250.4,"destroy God's chosen people here's a "],[1252.44,"brief history lesson for you to prove my "],[1254.12,"point Egypt Assyria Babylon Persia "],[1256.32,"Greece Rome six Empires all used by "],[1259.48,"Satan to try to destroy Israel why does "],[1262.56,"Satan want to destroy Israel because God "],[1264.52,"made all of these promises all of these "],[1266.76,"covenants to Israel and if Israel's "],[1269.72,"wiped out then none of this can come to "],[1272.68,"pass so for the past 4,000 years the "],[1275.48,"devil's been trying to destroy the "],[1277.2,"children of Israel "],[1278.84,"question does Israel "],[1282.48,"exist John Harris knows and the rest of "],[1284.68,"you aren't sure does Israel exist yes "],[1288.76,"imagine that God's word is still true "],[1293.52,"but the prophet tells of one "],[1296.44,"final Empire that will rise in the final "],[1300.32,"seven years that will be great and "],[1303.04,"terrible its leader is called in "],[1305.32,"scripture the Antichrist or this beast "],[1309,"and he will form a one world government "],[1311.92,"and there will be a One World Currency "],[1314.56,"and you will need a mark John calls it "],[1317.4,"in your right hand on your forehead in "],[1319.16,"order to buy or sell and that would seem "],[1321.64,"impossible in John's time but we today "],[1324.52,"understand the concept of a cashless "],[1327,"Society we can imagine all Financial "],[1329.68,"transactions can be controlled by a mark "],[1332.72,"Or maybe a microchip embedded in your "],[1335.36,"hand that you would just simply scan "],[1338.36,"right go Google that one that technology "],[1340.4,"is already in use today people are doing "],[1342.16,"that putting the stuff in and they're "],[1343.72,"using that has everything on it the "],[1345.92,"Antichrist brings in a one world "],[1347.44,"government he brings in a one world "],[1348.52,"world currency and he brings in a one "],[1350.2,"world religion and the one world "],[1352.56,"religion is led by this third individual "],[1355.2,"called the false prophet in ancient "],[1358.76,"times all religions they had prophets "],[1361.44,"who heard from their gods and their gods "],[1364.8,"told the prophet what to tell the people "],[1368.08,"and so the shaman or the witch doctor or "],[1371.28,"the Imam or whatever whatever Prophet "],[1374.64,"whatever holy man they had they would go "],[1377.24,"and they would tell the people "],[1378.96,"what the gods had said and that's where "],[1381.04,"all of the world religions come from the "],[1383.24,"demons the devil lies to the false "],[1385.96,"prophets who spreads these lies to the "],[1387.64,"masses so there are and then there's God "],[1391.16,"who tells uh his word to His prophets uh "],[1395.08,"so there's true prophets and there's "],[1397.36,"false prophets well how do we know the "],[1401.16,"difference well very simple which "],[1404.88,"prophecies come true John said the RW "],[1408.52,"Euphrates will dry up it's drying up the "],[1411.6,"Prophet Daniel said all these different "],[1413.68,"Empires are going to rise up and rule "],[1415.48,"over Israel and in the future he called "],[1418.36,"them Persia Greece Rome and one final "],[1423.28,"Empire and they have all happened just "],[1425.8,"as the Prophet Daniel for told we just "],[1428.72,"had Christmas celebrated the birth of "],[1431.04,"Jesus Jesus life birth and life and "],[1434.76,"death and Resurrection fulfilled over "],[1438.04,"four "],[1439.08,"400 Old Testament prophecies no other "],[1442.6,"religion can make these claims for the "],[1446,"last 17 years I have been teaching and "],[1448.4,"we've been studying biblical biblical "],[1450.8,"prophecies that keep coming true this is "],[1455.88,"truth but in the last days there's going "],[1459,"to be a great deception and people will "],[1461.8,"reject the truth and follow the false "],[1464.4,"prophets and the doctrines of the Demons "],[1467.4,"scripture says there will be falling "],[1468.84,"away in the last day and we are seeing "],[1470.72,"that that's another prophecy that we see "],[1473.04,"happening before our very eyes because "],[1475.44,"many churches today uh all churches used "],[1478,"to preach repent of sins trust in the "],[1480.72,"death and the resurrection of Jesus as "],[1482.36,"the means to obtain salvation and "],[1484.16,"eternal life and now you'll find that "],[1486.32,"most churches are not preaching repent "],[1487.76,"of sins they are not telling their "],[1489.96,"people to trust in Jesus the "],[1491.68,"proclamation of the Gospel has been "],[1493.6,"removed from the pulpit and the "],[1495.12,"preaching of what we do chapter and "],[1496.92,"verse that's not really all that "],[1499.28,"important anymore now it's just a lot of "],[1501.12,"positive affirming messages and this is "],[1504.12,"an indicator uh a a fulfillment of "],[1507.12,"Prophecy that tells us we are near the "],[1509.36,"end "],[1510.76,"times Revelation chapter thir chapter 16 "],[1515.04,"verse 13 so we saw the unclean spirits "],[1518,"of the frogs coming out of the mouths of "],[1519.36,"the Dragon the mouth of the Beast and "],[1521.12,"the mouth of the F false prophet we "],[1522.64,"explain that they are the spirits of "],[1525.36,"demons performing signs which go to the "],[1527.24,"kings of the Earth and "],[1528.96,"of the whole world to gather them for "],[1530.96,"the battle of the great day of God "],[1533.92,"Almighty so the saan and the Antichrist "],[1538.4,"and the false prophet they have their "],[1539.88,"plan but in reality since John already "],[1542.76,"knows about it and told us about it it's "],[1544.48,"obvious that this is really whose plan "],[1547.76,"it's God's plan right yes the devil "],[1549.8,"wants to fight this battle and he wants "],[1552.04,"to bring all the nations of the world "],[1553.56,"together to try to wipe Israel off the "],[1555.6,"map from the river to the Sea "],[1558.8,"Palestine be free is what they chant and "],[1561.88,"the college campuses these days oh the "],[1563.96,"fun things that are happening you know "],[1566.4,"that is a hatred of Israel that is "],[1569.28,"satanically "],[1570.68,"inspired we hear it we hear it in the "],[1573.12,"news I think there was a big rally in "],[1574.48,"New York you know that very thing was "],[1576.52,"going on and that is all for this very "],[1580.16,"reason for the um stopping God's word "],[1583.72,"from coming true so the devil the "],[1585.48,"Antichrist and the false prophet they "],[1586.8,"have their plan but God has his plan and "],[1590.64,"the battle is described here as what "],[1594.44,"thought that was a very interesting "],[1595.56,"phrase verse "],[1597.48,"14 the battle of the great day of God "],[1602,"Almighty the battle of Armageddon will "],[1604.56,"be when God shows the entire world that "],[1607.88,"he is Almighty the entire seven years of "],[1611.36,"the Great Tribulation are illustrating "],[1614.12,"this fact but people deny his "],[1616,"sovereignty and all the way up to the "],[1618.28,"the very end they continue to deny him "],[1620.24,"and those who dwell on the earth choose "],[1622.08,"the lies of the false prophet the Beast "],[1623.92,"and the dragon over the truth why would "],[1626.12,"they do that why would you pick a fight "],[1629.2,"with "],[1630.64,"God probably they don't like God's plan "],[1634.2,"they have their own ideas they have "],[1635.4,"their own plans and you know just people "],[1637.48,"don't like to be told what to do do do "],[1640.2,"you like God's "],[1642.52,"commands do you like you do you like his "],[1645.08,"plans right do you even know God's plans "],[1649.16,"do you know what they are just summarize "],[1652,"a few of them for you Matthew Chapter 5 "],[1654.64,"Jesus preached The Sermon on the Mount "],[1657.68,"and this is what he told people blessed "],[1659.64,"are the poor in spirit for theirs is the "],[1662.2,"Kingdom of Heaven blessed are those who "],[1664.16,"mourn they'll be comforted blessed are "],[1665.6,"the meek they will inherit the the Earth "],[1668.92,"blessed are those who are hunger and "],[1670.12,"thirst for righteousness they'll be "],[1671.4,"filled blessed are the merciful they'll "],[1672.88,"obtain Mercy blessed are the pure at "],[1674.56,"heart they will see God blessed are The "],[1677.48,"Peacemaker they'll be called the sons of "],[1680.56,"God blessed are those who are persecuted "],[1682.96,"for righteousness sake for theirs is the "],[1685.28,"kingdom of heaven and all throughout the "],[1689.28,"New Testament it's repeated over and "],[1691.68,"over those who put their faith and trust "],[1694.28,"in Jesus "],[1697.28,"inherit "],[1699.84,"what "],[1702,"everything we inherit everything when we "],[1705.48,"trust in Jesus and are born again we are "],[1708.64,"made the Sons and Daughters of God we "],[1711.08,"are called the children of God and as "],[1713.12,"the children of the almighty God we "],[1715.96,"inherit all things Paul says in "],[1718.64,"Galatians chapter 4 when the fullness of "],[1721.04,"time had come and God had sent forth his "],[1723.68,"son born of a woman born under the law "],[1726.28,"we just celebrated all that at Christmas "],[1727.76,"time to redeem those who were under the "],[1730.04,"law that we might receive the adoption "],[1732.92,"as sons and because you are Sons God has "],[1735.8,"sent his Spirit into your hearts cing "],[1738.64,"Abba Father therefore are we no longer "],[1740.64,"slaves but sons and if a son then an "],[1743.84,"heir of God through Christ see I don't "],[1748.48,"just know God's plans for judging the "],[1752.12,"Wicked the unbelievers I also know God's "],[1755.16,"plans to reward those who trust in Jesus "],[1758.92,"you will inherit all things if you're "],[1761.84,"trusting in Jesus he died to pay the "],[1764.6,"price of all your sins he rose again to "],[1767.64,"prove that he has power over sin and "],[1770.44,"death and hell and he will save you from "],[1772.92,"all three if you put your faith in him "],[1776.36,"maybe today you'd put your faith in him "],[1779.16,"believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you "],[1782.56,"shall be saved and for those of us who "],[1785.04,"do believe look at what Jesus says even "],[1788.76,"in the midst of these bold judgments "],[1790.72,"verse 15 he has a little little side "],[1793.6,"thing he wants to say to us I know that "],[1795.88,"because it's red letters behold behold "],[1798.44,"I'm coming as a thief blessed is He Who "],[1801.16,"Watches and keeps His Garment lest he "],[1803.44,"walk naked and they see his "],[1806.72,"shame he says blessed is He Who Watches "],[1810.88,"the Greek word grego means to pay strict "],[1815.2,"attention to be alert to be prepared "],[1819.12,"that's very Boy Scout isn't it that's "],[1820.52,"our be prepared the reoccurring message "],[1823.56,"of the Book of Revelation to the "],[1825.56,"believer is watch and be "],[1828.6,"ready I'm coming like a thief meaning "],[1832.04,"what how's a thief "],[1834.24,"come suddenly unexpectedly right you "],[1837.8,"didn't see that coming like that guy who "],[1839.48,"just drove his car down Bourbon Street "],[1842,"in New Orleans ran over all those people "],[1843.76,"nobody was expecting that like that "],[1845.24,"should not have happened even though "],[1847.8,"there are all these specific signs and "],[1849.44,"judgments during the Great Tribulation "],[1851.56,"Jesus stops here to tell his audience "],[1853.8,"watch and be "],[1856.16,"alert see it would be "],[1858.48,"easy for us to conclude well when I see "],[1862.36,"a big epidemic of sores breaking out in "],[1864.56,"everybody you know monkey pox on "],[1866.88,"everyone or the ocean turns to blood and "],[1869.56,"the River dries up then I'll start "],[1871.68,"paying attention until then I'll just "],[1873.52,"assume this is you know a long ways off "],[1876.16,"but that's not the right conclusion that "],[1877.96,"that's not the application Jesus wants "],[1879.92,"us to take away from this information "],[1882.08,"what's is that what does he want us to "],[1883.4,"take away be alert be ready now you "],[1888.04,"don't want to be naked and ashamed and "],[1892.2,"that goes back to jesus' description of "],[1894.64,"the Church of leysia back in chapter "],[1896.6,"three poor blind and naked you say "],[1900.52,"you're rich you say you're clothed you "],[1902.68,"say you have everything but I tell you "],[1904.92,"Jesus says that you're poor blind and "],[1907.32,"naked and his message to all the "],[1909.48,"churches is to watch and be ready so "],[1913.16,"don't wait to see these things happening "],[1915.48,"be ready "],[1916.56,"now God promises to save us from his "],[1920.52,"wrath to keep us out of the Great "],[1922.6,"Tribulation he doesn't want us anywhere "],[1925.12,"near this time he's not willing that any "],[1927.52,"should perish but all should come to "],[1929.64,"repentance Armageddon is not something "],[1931.92,"we want to be anywhere's near it is for "],[1934.48,"those who are deceived by the wicked one "],[1937.56,"who have rejected God's Gift of "],[1940.6,"Salvation it's so very easy for us to "],[1945.04,"ignore the Supernatural and just focus "],[1948.04,"on the here and now just the physical "],[1950.44,"world you "],[1951.84,"know frog demons Satan future One World "],[1956.44,"Empire whatever you know like it's all "],[1959.52,"very cryptic and weird Pastor Rob I "],[1961.68,"can't take that seriously you know I got "],[1963.28,"I gotta worry about graduating in a few "],[1964.96,"months and I got I gotta pay all the "],[1967,"stuff off that I bought for Christmas "],[1969.12,"and and I got so many other things to "],[1970.84,"focus on than just pay attention to some "],[1973.6,"ancient "],[1975.36,"prophecies except for the fact that the "],[1977.84,"ancient prophecies are coming to pass "],[1981.16,"right here right now that river is "],[1983.08,"drying up Google it Jesus says I come as "],[1986.84,"a thief and blessed are those who are "],[1990.12,"alert isn't that nice in the midst of "],[1992.76,"all this horrible things

"],[2016.48,"conflict that prepares the world for the "],[2019.48,"so-called man of peace to come unite the "],[2022.12,"world is the is the bird flu going to "],[2025.28,"erupt into another pandemic

34 trillion dollar "],[2035.92,"worth of debts is the Rapture going to "],[2038.28,"happen in 2025 I don't know I just know "],[2042.24,"all that we see in Revelation is the "],[2044.96,"future it is going to happen and we are "],[2048.72,"supposed to watch and be ready so how "],[2052.6,"about in 2025 we resolve to be ready be "],[2057.28,"ready for Jesus which means we need to "],[2060.48,"trust him now we need to be faithful "],[2063.72,"even now even today what a great way to "],[2066.76,"start the new year "],[2068.4,"trusting in Jesus every head bowed every "],[2070.8,"eye "],[2071.64,"closed let's just take a moment if "],[2073.96,"you've never trusted in Jesus this is a "],[2076.92,"great time to do it so easy the Bible "],[2080.16,"says if you confess with your mouth and "],[2081.8,"believe in your hearts and God being "],[2084.12,"omnipresent and all knowing we can just "],[2086.92,"pray even in the Silence of our own "],[2088.56,"Hearts this morning and say dear

Supernatural book that we "],[2110.6,"can know the future and we can know all "],[2112.68,"things and we can know that that those "],[2114.92,"who trust in Jesus inherit everything "],[2118.16,"and

"],[22.84,"of God and turn to the Book of "],[24.44,"Revelation as we uh continue on in our "],[27.64,"study through this book getting near the "],[31.24,"end and we are going "],[34.2,"to finish well finish I don't know we're "],[37.36,"RI we're ripping open the uh seventh "],[39.88,"bowl and we're going to see all that "],[41.96,"that entails this morning uh Revelation "],[45.08,"chapter 16 vers 17 through 21 and then "],[49.28,"we're going to actually get into some of "],[51.4,"chapter "],[52.36,"17 all right so let's pick it up 16:1 17 "],[55.92,"the seventh angel poured out his bow "],[59.32,"into the air "],[60.48,"a loud voice came out of the Temple of "],[62.56,"Heaven from the throne saying it is done "],[65.76,"there were noises and thundering and "],[67.96,"lightning and there was a great "],[69.56,"earthquake such a mighty and great "],[71.92,"earthquake as has not occurred since men "],[74.72,"were on the earth now the great city was "],[77.36,"divided into three parts and the cities "],[79.72,"of the Nations "],[82.72,"fell lost my place and great Babylon was "],[86.24,"remembered before God to give her the "],[88.68,"cup of the wine of his fierceness of his "],[91.08,"wrath then every island fled away and "],[93.92,"the mountains were not found and a great "],[96.24,"hail from Heaven fell upon men each "],[99.08,"Hailstone weighing about the weight of a "],[101.08,"talent men blasphemed God because of the "],[103.72,"plague of the hail since the plague was "],[106.36,"exceedingly great this week we saw parts "],[110.88,"of Los Angeles Going Up in Flames "],[114.32,"200,000 people had to be evacuated well "],[117.72,"over a hundred billion dollars worth of "],[120.84,"Destruction and adding insult to injury "],[124.24,"are the reports that the LA mayor had "],[126.88,"slashed 20 million from the fire "],[129.32,"department's budget the reservoir were "],[132.84,"empty and there was little to no water "],[135.72,"in the fire hydrants when the "],[137.44,"firefighters went to fight the fire the "],[139.4,"government of California had been "],[141.12,"repeatedly warned to exercise some "],[143.2,"Forest management strategies to clean up "],[146.08,"the dry underbrush and do controlled "],[148.2,"Burns to reduce the risk of these "],[150.88,"explosive wildfires but they said "],[155,"n the number one cause of the fires in "],[157.92,"California is their Antiquated "],[160.56,"electrical system much of the electrical "],[163.08,"infrastructure is well over 50 years old "],[165.88,"since the government has been investing "],[167.68,"in green power initiatives it was not "],[169.96,"spending on maintenance and upkeep of "],[172.08,"the current system even though they knew "],[174.28,"how dangerous these old lines and "],[175.8,"Equipment are the demands on the system "],[178.28,"are so great that they have to have "],[180.32,"rolling blackouts throughout the summer "],[182.68,"just you know so they can not overtax "],[185.32,"the system that's not really helpful "],[186.92,"when you're on oxygen or something like "],[188.64,"that and now it's your turn to have the "],[191.24,"electricity turned "],[192.92,"off the poor government policies have "],[195.88,"made the situation so much worse than it "],[198.28,"needed to be and since there is such a "],[200.4,"high risk of fires insurance companies "],[203.36,"were pulling fire insurance coverage "],[206.48,"they couldn't offer it and stay in "],[208.2,"business so many of the people who l "],[209.8,"lost their homes this past week had no "],[211.96,"fire Insurance all their possessions all "],[215.36,"of their Investments Up in Flames FEMA "],[219.92,"had no money so they said for North "],[223.08,"Carolina hurricane victims and the feds "],[225.96,"have been sending billions to other "],[227.68,"countries for Wars over somewhere else "],[229.96,"so I'm wondering if there's anything to "],[231.72,"help California so as they say a perfect "],[236,"storm and yet over here on the East "],[238.28,"Coast we're shoveling no not at all "],[241,"bothered by wildfires we feel empathy "],[244.36,"for those hurting people we are "],[246.32,"concerned for family and friends and "],[248.68,"countrymen but it's nothing we're "],[251.36,"directly having to deal with maybe some "],[254.64,"of the West Coast Californians will "],[257.56,"migrate to California Maryland or "],[260.44,"Hollywood Maryland no doubt they will "],[262.92,"have to leave that part of the country "],[265,"and try to find a better place to "],[267.48,"rebuild it was I was thinking about that "],[270,"it reminded me of two years ago uh when "],[272.24,"there was all these forest fires in "],[273.76,"Canada and we were in Alberta at my "],[276.48,"nephew's wedding while everything was on "],[279.12,"fire and the fire was encroaching on the "],[280.8,"airport and we were driving through the "],[282.52,"smoke to get to the airport uh those "],[285.08,"people were fighting to save their "],[286.28,"properties and we just flew off to "],[288.6,"safety down here on the East Coast uh we "],[292.28,"might feel the effects of these uh fires "],[295.52,"when in the markets once uh people start "],[298.36,"rebuilding in the price of lumber "],[300.4,"skyrockets but for the most part we are "],[302.92,"unaffected by what's happening in "],[304.24,"California and this is always the case "],[306.84,"when there is a catastrophe a war a "],[309.12,"drought a plague in one other part of "],[311.16,"the world 10,000 miles away you're not "],[313.52,"really bothered by "],[315.2,"it that is not the case with what is "],[319.04,"going on here in Revelation chapter 16 "],[322.8,"John tells of the global destruction "],[326.4,"that befalls all cities when the Angel "],[330.04,"pours out the seventh bowl of judgment "],[334,"we saw here in verse number 19 that the "],[337.28,"great City that well we go back and we "],[339.24,"see that he poured it out and there was "],[341.08,"a great earthquake Verse 18 such a "],[343.64,"mighty and great earthquake is not "],[345.6,"occurred since men were on the earth the "],[347.96,"great city was divided into three parts "],[350.64,"and the cities of the Nations cities of "],[353.92,"the Nations fell they all "],[357.76,"fell verse number 2 tells us that the "],[360.6,"every island fled away and the mountains "],[363.8,"were no more so we're talking about "],[366.76,"global destruction that's so hard to get "],[370.48,"our heads around how vast "],[373.2,"how "],[374.72,"all-encompassing this is so think about "],[377.44,"what we saw in La this past week and "],[380.64,"imagine every city being destroyed all "],[384.36,"at once an earthquake that levels "],[388.8,"everything there's no place to evacuate "],[392,"to there's no place to move to and "],[395.4,"rebuild there's no safe spaces since the "],[399.52,"Antichrist in collaboration with the 10 "],[402.92,"kingdoms have all United together to "],[406.04,"raise up this final Global Empire that "],[409.04,"is defiant to God it means that the "],[411.6,"whole world is going to share in the "],[414.32,"wrath of God Humanity has all of its "],[417.72,"eggs in one basket people tell you you "],[420.68,"shouldn't put all your eggs in one "],[422.4,"basket right "],[424.64,"why because if you drop that one basket "],[428.64,"you've lost all your eggs right it that "],[431.2,"expression means don't have a single "],[432.92,"point of failure you know don't put all "],[434.24,"your savings in Bitcoin because if that "],[435.92,"collapses you're wiped out in the past "],[440.08,"when an empire fell another one was on "],[442.84,"the rise and Persia fell Greece Rose "],[447.04,"meanwhile in Japan they were completely "],[449.64,"affected with any of that the rise of "],[451.76,"the Mayans the Incans the Aztec empires "],[454.84,"in Central and South America that had no "],[457.2,"impact on the Roman Empire or the Ming "],[459.92,"Dynasty for centuries people moved to "],[462.52,"all these extreme locations all over the "],[465.48,"globe people living deep in dense "],[467.96,"jungles people living on obscure Islands "],[471.24,"people living way up north in the Arctic "],[473.96,"in an igloo surviving off of seal fat "],[478.12,"whale blubber that's my people right "],[479.72,"there that's where we "],[481.4,"were "],[483.32,"why why would you live in a remote place "],[485.76,"to get away from tyrants Wars feuding "],[489.32,"tribes and clashing Empires why did the "],[492.32,"Europeans travel across the Atlantic to "],[494.4,"the new world right for Freedom all of "],[497.96,"the different nations peppered all over "],[500.44,"the globe are different baskets for the "],[504,"eggs of humanity to survive in what "],[506.6,"happens when you put it all in one "],[507.92,"basket everyone under one government One "],[510.96,"Financial system one religion that "],[513.96,"rejects and curses God Revelation "],[517.08,"chapter 16 is what "],[519.44,"happens I take these verses as a summary "],[522.6,"statement of the total collapse of the "],[525,"Antichrist One World Empire and then the "],[528,"next three chapters spell out all the "],[530.8,"details much of like the way Genesis 1:1 "],[535.56,"in the beginning God created the heavens "],[537.76,"and the Earth that's an introductory "],[539.76,"statement and then the next two chapters "],[541.52,"fill out all the details in day one he "],[543.2,"did this day two he did this day three "],[545.56,"Revelation chapter 16 is telling us of "],[547.8,"the destruction of the Empire and then "],[549.84,"chapter 17 and 18 give us the details "],[552.12,"about who what the Empire is and why "],[555.64,"it's being destroyed Revelation chapter "],[558.32,"19 or chapter 16: 19 the great city was "],[562.84,"divided into three parts the cities of "],[565.44,"the Nations fell and great Babylon was "],[569.6,"remembered before God to give her the "],[572.04,"cup of the wine of the fierceness of his "],[577.04,"wrath two times in the Book of "],[579.52,"Revelation Babylon is has been mentioned "],[582.52,"now first it was chapter 14:8 where an "],[584.84,"angel flew across the Earth and says "],[586.8,"Fallen Fallen is Babylon and now this is "],[590.28,"the second time the the name Babylon "],[592.44,"comes up so here's the thing when John "],[595.04,"wrote this book in 100 AD Babylon was "],[599.68,"not great it was in Rapid decline it had "],[602.6,"no power nobody cared about ruling it "],[604.92,"and by 1,000 ad the whole place was "],[607.16,"completely abandoned and today it's just "],[609.36,"an ancient ruin that archaeologists like "],[612.04,"to go dig in the dirt so why is it being "],[615.24,"called Babylon the great especially in "],[619.52,"the future are they going to rebuild "],[621.68,"that City in Iraq Sadam Hussein back in "],[624.12,"the 90s said he was going to be the new "],[625.72,"Nebuchadnezzar and he was going to "],[626.8,"rebuild Babylon that didn't work out "],[628.68,"very well did it Babylon is a rather "],[633.2,"lengthy subject so in scripture so I'm "],[635.72,"going to do my best to kind of give you "],[637.12,"a a boiled down summary today so we see "],[641.28,"this Babylon the great was remembered "],[643.16,"before God and it says the great city "],[645.88,"fell all the cities fell and then "],[649.28,"Babylon great Babylon was remembered now "],[651.64,"upon reading that verse some people "],[653.04,"would conclude that the great "],[655.48,"city is Babylon because in the Old "],[658.96,"Testament Babylon is a literal City yes "],[661,"but Babylon was more than a city it was "],[662.92,"also the name of the Empire the whole "],[666.04,"region was called the Babylonian Empire "],[668.44,"just like Rome a Rome's the same way "],[670.68,"it's a city but it was also the Roman "],[673.92,"Empire everything was called Rome so the "],[677.08,"great city is probably the capital city "],[680.28,"of the an antichrist Global Empire in "],[683.56,"John's day they would have probably "],[685.84,"assumed and belied that would have been "],[688.04,"Rome because Rome was ruling the world "],[690.6,"and that's where all the power was uh "],[692.84,"some people still still think Rome might "],[694.36,"be a good option today because of the uh "],[696.84,"some of the politics and some of the you "],[699.2,"know religious organizations that are "],[701.32,"centered in Rome some people think that "],[703.4,"the great City could be New York City "],[706.2,"and people think that's it because you "],[707.6,"know with Wall Street New York has got "],[709.68,"one of the biggest financial "],[710.84,"institutions in all of the world some "],[714.04,"options but remember the "],[716.6,"Antichrist goes to the temple and "],[718.84,"declares himself to be God and the "],[721.64,"temple is in what city Jerusalem the "],[725.36,"false Christ wants to be worshiped and "],[728.04,"Rule from the city of God so maybe "],[731.12,"Jerusalem will be his headquarters the "],[733.52,"capital city of his Empire just as Satan "],[737.08,"declared to Jesus face during his "],[740.24,"temptation in the wilderness the devil "],[742.2,"took Jesus up on a high mountain showed "],[744.24,"him the kingdoms of this world and said "],[746.16,"all of these are mine and I can give "],[749.28,"them to you if you would just worship me "],[753.36,"all the great empires of men have been "],[755.92,"empowered by Satan to rule the world on "],[759.64,"his behalf but the world is not "],[762.48,"rightfully his we've said before he's "],[765.16,"just a squatter Jesus is coming back to "],[768.88,"evict him and give the world back to the "],[772,"children of God the ultimate challenge "],[774.32,"of jesus' authority is to claim "],[776.52,"squatter's rights in Jerusalem because "],[779.68,"prophecy makes it clear that the Messiah "],[781.24,"is going to rule in Jerusalem defiantly "],[784.48,"the false Messiah sets up his rule in "],[786.8,"the great City but his Empire is not "],[790.64,"just one city it's worldwide and John is "],[793.76,"using the name Babylon to refer to the "],[796.92,"entire Antichrist Global future Empire "],[800.24,"the One World Government the One World "],[801.68,"economy the one world religion and I'll "],[804.2,"show you that that all of this is "],[807.04,"referred to Babylon let me show you why "],[809.6,"the biggest source of material on "],[812.52,"Babylon that we have is the Book of "],[816.68,"Daniel Babylon the Gentile nation that "],[819.36,"God used to punish and chastise the "],[821.24,"nation of Israel from for their "],[824.88,"Disobedience fulfilling the Prophecies "],[827.36,"of Jeremiah Israel Jerusalem and the "],[830.32,"temple were destroyed and a remnant of "],[832.56,"Jews were carried off to Babylon while "],[836.12,"in captivity Young Daniel a faithful "],[839.12,"Hebrew was given the gift of Prophecy "],[842,"and God spoke to the king of Babylon to "],[844.32,"the nation of Israel and to all of us "],[847.12,"through Daniel God showed us the "],[851.92,"future Nebuchadnezzar had a "],[854.84,"dream he dreamt of a great statue of a "],[858.36,"man the head of that statue was made of "],[861.76,"gold the arms and chest was made of "],[864.96,"silver the belly in this area was made "],[867.96,"of bronze the legs were made of iron and "],[871.6,"then the feet were a mix of iron and "],[875.76,"Clay they were all joined together a "],[879.52,"Stone comes hurling out of the heavens "],[882.76,"smashes the feet of the statue the "],[885.68,"Statue crumbles the stone grows into a "],[889,"great Mountain that fills the whole "],[892,"earth a picture is worth a thousand "],[895.64,"words that is a summary of 2600 years of "],[901.56,"human history "],[903.32,"including the near future things that "],[905.96,"have yet to have "],[907.16,"happened that picture right "],[909.44,"there interesting God gave Daniel the "],[913.56,"interpretation the head of gold was the "],[917.12,"Babylonian Empire the silver arms and "],[919.96,"chest was the Persian Empire the bronze "],[923.12,"was the Grecian Empire the legs of iron "],[926.08,"was the Roman Empire and the feet of "],[929.24,"mixed with Clay future Empire a "],[932.68,"coalition of 10 kingdoms joining "],[936.12,"together which made sense because you "],[938.36,"got how many toes 10 most of you have "],[941.68,"some of you don't have 10 but most of "],[943.12,"you have 10 and that represented 10 "],[945.2,"literal kingdoms that will come together "],[947.56,"to form the one final "],[949.56,"future Empire of the Antichrist the "],[952.76,"stone hitting the feet destroying the "],[954.76,"whole thing growing into a mountain that "],[956.6,"fills the whole earth that is Jesus "],[960.24,"Messiah smashing the kingdoms of men "],[962.92,"establishing the Messianic Thousand-Year "],[965.76,"reign of Jesus Christ over the entire "],[968.92,"world even though there are different "],[971.32,"parts making up this statue nevertheless "],[974.52,"they're all still part of the same thing "],[977.92,"they are all Gentile Nations and Empires "],[980.92,"that have dominion over Israel then the "],[983.64,"head of the whole entire statue's name "],[986.4,"is what is it Bon thank you three people "],[990.56,"for following the plot here the whole "],[992.88,"thing the head is called Babylon God "],[995.4,"sees the whole thing all the empires "],[997.96,"empowered by Satan as the same thing "],[1000.84,"because it is the last great world "],[1004.44,"Empire during the Great Tribulation is "],[1007.44,"connected to and a continuation of the "],[1011.36,"former World Empires which ultimately "],[1014.08,"are all controlled by Satan all "],[1015.64,"throughout the Book of Revelation John's "],[1017.56,"been giving us symbolic images to help "],[1019.8,"us visualize and understand the size and "],[1022.36,"the scope of all that Babylon is they "],[1024.76,"say a picture is worth a thousand words "],[1026.76,"and God gives us repeated consistent "],[1029.32,"images to help us understand what "],[1031.52,"exactly he's trying to judge it's why "],[1034.28,"the dragon is described in Revelation 12 "],[1038.88,"verse three I appeared in heaven a great "],[1041.8,"fiery Dragon having seven heads and 10 "],[1043.68,"horns seven diadems on his head and then "],[1046.6,"the beast in Chapter 13 is just "],[1048.88,"described the same way then I saw the "],[1050.84,"sand of the Seas and the Beast rose up "],[1052.68,"out of the sea having seven heads 10 "],[1054.48,"horns 10 horns 10 had the crowns on his "],[1057.92,"head of Blasphemous names and the Beast "],[1060.56,"and then it goes into an elaborate "],[1062.2,"description of the Beast and all that is "],[1063.92,"imagery referring back to the Book of "],[1066.32,"Daniel uh but ultimately the dragon gave "],[1068.88,"him his power his throne and great "],[1071.36,"Authority so this imagery is showing us "],[1074.68,"God's view this imagery is telling us "],[1078.2,"all the Gentile kingdoms of men all "],[1080.56,"throughout human history that oppressed "],[1082.8,"and attacked the children of Israel were "],[1084.72,"all satanically inspired and empowered "],[1087.2,"to do so the dragon Satan and the Beast "],[1091.76,"descriptions match seven heads 10 horms "],[1094.96,"because they're one and the same the "],[1096.56,"seven heads are seven Empires seven "],[1099.76,"Gentile Empires including two that were "],[1103.12,"before Daniel so what were the two "],[1105.28,"before Daniel that were oppressive and a "],[1108.04,"challenge to Israel "],[1109.48,"there was the one that uh Moses brought "],[1111.88,"them out of that was Egypt they tried to "],[1114.32,"destroy Israel and then the next one all "],[1116.4,"throughout the Kings they were dealing "],[1118.28,"with Assyria and then after Assyria and "],[1121.76,"in in Daniel's time became Babylon and "],[1124.68,"then Persia and then in the inter testal "],[1127.04,"periods Greece Alexander the Great and "],[1129.4,"then in jesus' time it's Rome it's Rome "],[1132.84,"and then in our time the future one is "],[1135.44,"going to be the amalgamation of the 10 "],[1138.2,"toes so the 10 horns of the Beast "],[1141.8,"described on the dragon and on the F and "],[1143.76,"on the on the Beast is the 10 future "],[1146.52,"kings just like the 10 toes on the "],[1150.16,"Statue see they're running that theme of "],[1152.28,"10 10 kingdoms coming together when we "],[1155.52,"talk about Babylon we do turn to Daniel "],[1158.4,"but Daniel is dealing with Babylon in "],[1161,"600 BC but Babylon started way before "],[1164.48,"that it it you have to go back another "],[1166.8,"1,600 years to get to the beginning 2200 "],[1170.36,"BC and where would you go to find the "],[1173.04,"beginning of something what's the "],[1174.2,"beginning book Genesis turn to Genesis "],[1178.92,"chapter 10 and we'll see the beginning "],[1181.88,"of "],[1182.76,"Babylon Genesis chapter 10 the context "],[1187.16,"verse one tells us this is just a boring "],[1190.6,"genealogy of the sons of Noah Shem ham "],[1193.52,"and japeth and the sons that were born "],[1196.28,"After the flood so we're going all the "],[1197.8,"way back to Noah and his family walking "],[1200.88,"off the flood off the off the ark and it "],[1204.2,"says that ham had some sons and they "],[1207.2,"were verse number six ham had Kush and "],[1209.96,"mitbar and put and Canan and then it "],[1212.84,"tells us that kush had a son verse "],[1215.8,"number eight Kush begot Nimrod so this "],[1219.48,"is a great grandson of Noah Nimrod and "],[1222.28,"he began to be a mighty Hunter on the "],[1225.44,"earth he was a mighty Hunter before the "],[1227.24,"Lord therefore it was said like Nimrod "],[1229.32,"the mighty Hunter before the Lord and "],[1233.08,"then it says Nimrod verse number "],[1236.64,"10 the beginning of his kingdom was "],[1240.12,"Babel Eric accad Kalen the land of Shar "],[1244.52,"and from that land he went to Assyria "],[1247.4,"and built Nineveh and then on and on "],[1250.04,"some other cities so Nimrod whose name "],[1252.16,"in Hebrew means Rebel or let us Revolt "],[1257.08,"this Mighty Hunter the the Builder of "],[1259.4,"cities the beginning of his kingdom was "],[1263,"Babel and what happened at "],[1265.88,"Babel the Great Rebellion against God "],[1268.72,"where they built the Tower of Babel "],[1271.52,"that's chapter "],[1273.32,"11 the next chapter over that they all "],[1276.28,"had one speech and the group of people "],[1278.32,"journeyed down to the plains of shinar "],[1280.88,"and they said let's make bricks and "],[1283.28,"stone and let's build a city and a tower "],[1287.24,"whose top is the heaven and let us make "],[1289.48,"a name for ourselves on the face of the "],[1292,"whole earth and God came down and he saw "],[1294.8,"the tower and he saw the intention of "],[1296.96,"the people and he said well they're of "],[1298.84,"one language there's nothing they won't "],[1300.24,"be able to do so they confused the "],[1302.96,"languages and made everyone speak "],[1304.64,"different languages and that's why we "],[1306.4,"got people here speaking English and "],[1307.8,"people here speaking German and people "],[1309.24,"here speaking Spanish we got all these "],[1311,"different languages right and who I "],[1312.64,"don't know there's other languages here "],[1313.64,"I'm sure there are and uh that was "],[1315.6,"because of the Tower of Babel and God "],[1317.92,"wanted to disperse everybody so Babel "],[1321.44,"was the first place post flood where man "],[1325.44,"decided to make a name for himself in "],[1327.8,"defiance of God and the king of Babel "],[1330.64,"was NE Nimrod and according to Jewish "],[1334.36,"Traditions outside of scripture their "],[1336.56,"writings Nimrod was a powerful man he "],[1339.16,"was a rebel he was a tyrant he desired "],[1342.28,"desired to be worshiped and exalted and "],[1345.12,"he turned people away from God "],[1346.6,"developing his own religion where he he "],[1349.32,"would be "],[1350.8,"glorified so when God judged Humanity at "],[1353.6,"the Tower of Babel and the languages "],[1355.2,"were confused all these different "],[1357.6,"peoples scattered they went their "],[1360.6,"separate ways but they maintained the "],[1363.36,"sto the origin stories in their own "],[1365.52,"tongue and we see in all the cultures "],[1367.48,"across the world that there's still this "],[1369.24,"great flood story and also they all have "],[1372.96,"this false religion of nimrod this false "],[1376.2,"religion of nimrod look at Revelation 7 "],[1379.28,"as we elaborate more on what is Babylon "],[1383.36,"what is this false religion verse number "],[1387.12,"one Revelation "],[1389.2,"17 one of the Seven Angels who had the "],[1391.84,"seven bowls came and talked to me saying "],[1393.84,"I will show you the Judgment of the "],[1395.76,"great Harlot who sits on many Waters "],[1399.36,"with whom the kings of the earth commit "],[1401.04,"fornication and the inhabitants of the "],[1403.08,"earth were made drunk with the wine of "],[1405.04,"her fornication so he carried me away in "],[1407.8,"the spirit and to the Wilderness and I "],[1409.64,"saw a woman sitting on a Scarlet Beast "],[1413,"now look at the description of the Beast "],[1415.28,"whose names was full of bles having "],[1417.48,"seven heads and 10 horns the woman was "],[1419.8,"arrayed in purple and Scarlet adorned "],[1422.36,"with gold and precious stones pearls "],[1424.76,"having in her hand a golden cup full of "],[1426.72,"the Abominations of the filthiness of "],[1428.88,"her fornication and on her forehead was "],[1431.08,"a name written mystery Babylon the great "],[1434.24,"the mother of harlots and the "],[1436.92,"Abominations of the Earth I saw that "],[1439.16,"woman drunk with the blood of the Saints "],[1441.52,"with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus "],[1443.56,"and I saw her I marveled with great "],[1448.44,"amazements that's quite a "],[1450.84,"description but "],[1452.96,"it tying a lot of things together that "],[1456.12,"you've learned through your Bible "],[1458.48,"studies in the Old Testament we saw time "],[1461.76,"and time again whenever the children of "],[1463.64,"Israel worshiped false gods they were "],[1465.96,"compared to a what "],[1468.88,"an adulterous woman they were in a "],[1471.76,"covenant relationship but they were "],[1473.72,"being unfaithful so God compares the "],[1477.24,"faithfulness he desires from his "],[1479.12,"children to that of a marriage "],[1481.48,"relationship even in the New Testament "],[1483.72,"the church is called the bride of Christ "],[1487.44,"and he wants us to be a Chase faithful "],[1490.56,"people of Virgin bride so this "],[1493.56,"reoccurring theme all throughout "],[1495.92,"scripture of equating false religion "],[1499.12,"with adultery helps us interpret the "],[1502.08,"imagery of Revelation 17 the Harlot here "],[1506.24,"is symbolizing all of the false religion "],[1509.56,"that began at Babylon the false gods of "],[1512.96,"Antiquities were fertility gods they "],[1517.48,"worshiped them with the hopes of getting "],[1520.72,"Prosperity do you remember one of the "],[1522.6,"names of one of the fertility Gods we "],[1524.24,"saw Clash time and time again what's "],[1526.68,"that guy's name b B right baale was "],[1529.6,"always that God that of the "],[1531.88,"Canaanites molok was another one they "],[1534.68,"were different names of different of "],[1536.72,"these fertility Gods "],[1539.28,"so the Harlot here is symbolizing all "],[1542.48,"the false religions that began in "],[1545.56,"Babylon and the false religions with "],[1548.32,"these fertility Gods worshiping them for "],[1551.2,"Prosperity that meant you'd get an "],[1553.12,"abundance of crops you'd get an "],[1555,"abundance of livestock you'd have a "],[1557,"large family you have many sons because "],[1560.2,"that's what made a man powerful you "],[1562.56,"built your clan and that was your wealth "],[1565.6,"and that's why in the Old Testament when "],[1567.04,"you see Abraham and Jacob and you see "],[1569.52,"it's always talking about their flocks "],[1571.8,"that's because that was a sign of wealth "],[1573.88,"and abundance and blessings God blessed "],[1576.84,"Abraham and he had an abundance of "],[1578.32,"flocks and and then having a child "],[1580.32,"having a son was God's blessing and "],[1582.4,"Jacob having 12 sons and all the flocks "],[1585.08,"that was saying that was communicating "],[1587.12,"God has blessed that man "],[1588.92,"so according to the false religions of "],[1591.72,"Babylon Egypt the Canaanites Nineveh all "],[1594.04,"of them the fertility Gods would make "],[1596.52,"them prosperous like I said Baal was a "],[1598.88,"fertility God and he would give you "],[1600.28,"victory in battle and he would protect "],[1601.92,"you from droughts and plagues and these "],[1604.48,"false religions included their practices "],[1607.76,"included Sex Magic and Temple "],[1610.92,"prostitutes that's what they were doing "],[1613.44,"in Canaan making even childhood "],[1616.52,"sacrifices the ancient world was all "],[1619.36,"about the glorification of the Flesh and "],[1623.56,"materialism the conquest of other "],[1625.84,"people's lands and that's the essence of "],[1629.24,"Babylon and that is what the false "],[1631.36,"religions focus on conquering lands "],[1633.92,"gaining power and control promoting self "],[1637.52,"Nebuchadnezzar famously Illustrated that "],[1640.16,"Spirit Daniel chapter 4 it said It Came "],[1643.04,"Upon Nebuchadnezzar the end of the 12th "],[1645.04,"months he was walking in his Royal "],[1646.64,"Palace in Babylon and and the King spoke "],[1650.08,"saying is this not great Babylon that I "],[1653.92,"have built for "],[1656.36,"my Royal dwelling my mighty power and "],[1660.72,"for the honor of my "],[1663.84,"majesty and that is The Telltale sign of "],[1667.04,"Babylon self- glorification and this "],[1670.64,"arrogance but James challenges us "],[1673.8,"Believers he says now pay attention here "],[1677.52,"you who say today tomorrow I we will go "],[1680.48,"to such a city and we'll spend a year "],[1682.44,"there and we'll sell and we'll make "],[1684.16,"profit whereas you don't know what's "],[1685.84,"going to happen tomorrow what what is "],[1687.84,"your life you're but a vapor it appears "],[1691.64,"for a little time you vanish away "],[1693.88,"instead what you ought to say if the "],[1696.4,"Lord Wills we will live and do this and "],[1699.36,"do that but now you boast in your "],[1701.72,"arrogance and all such boasting is what "],[1706.2,"evil "],[1709.64,"and that's why I feel the need different "],[1714.64,"times to push back on the mega "],[1719.32,"Mantra right I yes I want to live in "],[1724.44,"America and it to be strong and "],[1727.2,"prosperous I want it to be a land of "],[1729.2,"opportunity but I want the blessings of "],[1732.96,"God not Satan I want God to be glorified "],[1738.12,"and praised in me Christ be magnified "],[1741.96,"from the altar of my life not "],[1745.48,"celebrities so the arrogance and the "],[1747.76,"boasting James says is evil The Humble "],[1751.08,"trusting in God faith in obedience to "],[1753.84,"God that is our highest value not "],[1756.84,"believing in self not believing in man "],[1760.64,"Nimrod started that mind and every "],[1763.28,"Empire since continued it the strong "],[1765.96,"rule the weak Conquest "],[1769.56,"my two favorite board games growing up "],[1773.2,"were risk "],[1776,"and "],[1778.6,"Monopoly and what is the goal of those "],[1781.44,"games take over "],[1783.68,"everything on the whole "],[1786.64,"world but think about the laws of God "],[1790.56,"love the Lord your God and love your "],[1794.28,"neighbor love is patient and kind and it "],[1797.36,"doesn't end Envy Envy is like I want "],[1800.04,"everything love doesn't parade itself "],[1802,"it's not puffed up it doesn't behave "],[1803.88,"rudely you should see a risk game it's "],[1806.12,"rude man it "],[1807.44,"is it it doesn't seek its own it's not "],[1810.28,"easily provoked love doesn't rejoice in "],[1812.28,"evil it rejoice in truth and God "],[1814.2,"commands us to love one another to share "],[1816.92,"and be hospitable give and it will be "],[1820.16,"given to you well that's the complete "],[1822.4,"opposite of all that the world Empires "],[1824.88,"do and James explains this to us doesn't "],[1827.2,"he he says where do Wars and fighting "],[1829.52,"come from do they not come from your "],[1832.96,"desire for pleasure that you wore in "],[1835.4,"your members you lust and you do not "],[1837.52,"have you murder and covet and you cannot "],[1839.68,"obtain you fight and you War yet you do "],[1842.16,"not have because you do not ask you ask "],[1844.6,"and you don't receive because you ask a "],[1846.64,"miss that you would spend it on your own "],[1848.08,"Pleasures adulterers adulteresses do you "],[1851.04,"not know that friendship with the world "],[1854.08,"is enity with God whoever therefore "],[1857.16,"wants to be a friend of the world makes "],[1859.24,"himself an enemy of God see how James "],[1863.88,"there in verse number four connects the "],[1866.44,"attitude "],[1868.12,"of desire and craving for the world with "],[1872,"adultery loving the world is "],[1875.72,"unfaithfulness to God it's hating God "],[1879.76,"the world it says there that's the Greek "],[1882.44,"word Cosmos it refers to it means the "],[1886.16,"ungodly multitude the the whole mass of "],[1889.48,"humanity that is alienated from God and "],[1892.44,"hostile to the cause of Christ Babel is "],[1896.16,"where it started Babylon is the mother "],[1899.56,"that birthed that worldly philosophy but "],[1902.52,"we are told by John do not love the "],[1904.92,"world or the things that are in the "],[1906.48,"world for the love of the father is not "],[1908.6,"in him anyone who loves the world the "],[1910.04,"love of the father is not in him for the "],[1911.68,"all that is of the world the lust of the "],[1913.16,"flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of "],[1914.84,"love that's not of the father but that's "],[1916.56,"of the world and the world is "],[1918.72,"passing away and the lust thereof but he "],[1921.44,"that does the will of God abides forever "],[1925.76,"Babylon is the worship of self "],[1928.04,"self-exaltation Nimrod was the living "],[1930.72,"embodiment of it and so will be the "],[1934.28,"Antichrist all the great empires of men "],[1937.12,"all down through the centuries were all "],[1939.4,"chasing that dream and Satan dangles "],[1942.04,"that car carrot in front of all of the "],[1945.12,"world he he dangles that in front of all "],[1946.92,"of us he dangles the things of this "],[1949.36,"world to see who will chase it the "],[1951.8,"hardest who will sell their souls for "],[1954.08,"what the world has to offer and the most "],[1956.6,"ruthless will do it the best they will "],[1959.64,"steal and kill and destroy and they will "],[1962.12,"dominate for a time but it is a false "],[1965.44,"hope it is a false belief it is a false "],[1967.84,"religion because you can never be God "],[1970.16,"you can never control everything you "],[1972.24,"could be strong and powerful only for a "],[1974.08,"little bit of time but eventually you "],[1975.8,"get sick and you get old you get 40 and "],[1979.36,"you fall down right and you get old and "],[1982.16,"then you die so what does it profit you "],[1985.28,"to gain the whole world and lose your "],[1991.12,"soul "],[1992.96,"Babylon it seems so cryptic here in "],[1996.16,"Revelation but can you see how "],[1998.16,"everything ties together I've just tied "],[1999.88,"all of Genesis all the way to "],[2002.12,"revelation we see here in Revelation "],[2004.32,"chapter 17 that the um the angel says "],[2008.56,"I'll show you the Judgment of the great "],[2010.92,"Harlot who sits on many's Waters and and "],[2013.48,"we know from before that water "],[2015.12,"symbolizes the G Gentile Nations and and "],[2019.16,"people think that there's you know "],[2020.28,"there's all these different world "],[2022,"religions and all these different races "],[2024.04,"and all these different cultures and "],[2025.56,"there's all these complexities within "],[2027.24,"society and it's no it's pretty much the "],[2030.4,"same thing there's one of two ways to "],[2034.72,"live you either serve God by serving "],[2038.92,"others loving others or you serve "],[2041.68,"yourself and chase after the things of "],[2043.92,"this world that bring you "],[2045.52,"pleasure and Paul specifically tells us "],[2049.2,"what it will be like in the last days "],[2051.76,"second Timothy chapter 3 he says know "],[2054.04,"this in the last days perilous times "],[2055.68,"will come men will be lovers of self "],[2060.4,"lovers of money boasters proud "],[2064,"blasphemers disobedient to parents "],[2066.36,"unthankful Unholy UNL loving unforgiving "],[2068.96,"slanderers without self-control brutal "],[2072.44,"despisers of good traitors headstrong "],[2074.52,"hottie lovers of pleasure rather than "],[2077.32,"lovers of God having a form of godliness "],[2079.68,"but denying the power and from such "],[2083.08,"people turn "],[2086.08,"away that's what people believe in "],[2089,"that's what Americans believe in that's "],[2090.8,"the spirit of "],[2092.28,"Babylon that is "],[2095.24,"until they go out and live it in the "],[2098.64,"world and they try it and they get "],[2102.16,"wrecked the world chws people up "],[2104.84,"Monopoly is fun when you're "],[2106.92,"winning it's despairing when you're "],[2109.76,"losing it makes you so mad at your "],[2113.44,"cousin he could see that you can't "],[2115.84,"afford to pay the rent and yet he's over "],[2117.76,"there celebrating that you landed on his "],[2120.08,"hotel and he's cheering for your "],[2123.88,"bankruptcy drug dealers don't care if "],[2127.24,"you're destroying your health they just "],[2129.04,"want to get paid liquor store owners "],[2132.2,"don't care if you're drinking away the "],[2134.16,"rent they just want to get paid e girls "],[2138.04,"don't care if you're destroying your "],[2139.76,"mental health fantasizing about them "],[2143.28,"they "],[2144.2,"just only one person is following my "],[2146.56,"Trend here they just want to get paid "],[2149.72,"politicians don't care that they're "],[2151.84,"destroying the nation's wealth devaluing "],[2154.04,"the dollar causing inflation to "],[2155.72,"Skyrocket they just want to get paid all "],[2160.12,"around us "],[2162.96,"Babylon Revelation chapter 17 notice the "],[2167.16,"notice this woman the description I Saw "],[2169.64,"The Woman verse three sitting on the "],[2171.6,"Scarlet beasts with the names of "],[2173.44,"blasphemy the woman was array in purple "],[2175.92,"and Scarlet were adorned with gold "],[2178.24,"precious stones pearls having in her "],[2180.48,"hand a golden "],[2184.84,"cup s she symbolizes the false religion "],[2188.68,"riding the beast here meaning the "],[2191.6,"Antichrist system and the religion is "],[2194.16,"working together which makes sense why "],[2197.2,"why would everyone in the world why "],[2198.44,"would all these individual 10 Nations "],[2200.28,"give up their sovereignty and join this "],[2201.64,"one great Empire what would be their "],[2203.64,"motivation well it's the it's the the "],[2207.84,"purple and the satin and the gold and "],[2210.36,"the precious stones and the pearls and "],[2212.08,"the golden cup it's the money the wealth "],[2216.08,"the pleasures the fornication the world "],[2219.32,"follows the Antichrist because he "],[2221.16,"promises them all the riches people "],[2223.72,"believe he's going to make everything "],[2226.36,"good everyone gets what they want you "],[2228.88,"have whatever you want and you do "],[2230.72,"whatever you want life becomes an all "],[2233.4,"inclusive vacation you can eat anything "],[2237,"you can drink everything luxury's "],[2239.36,"pleasure everything the world has to "],[2241.6,"offer but we children of God we "],[2245.48,"recognize that trap "],[2248.16,"we know that we're to be separate like "],[2251.28,"young Daniel and his friends as they go "],[2253.2,"into captivity into Babylon their faith "],[2255.88,"was tested when the question was put "],[2258.36,"before them here's the King's food "],[2260.04,"here's the king's drink and they knew "],[2261.4,"the laws of God and they knew the go la "],[2263.84,"God's laws say don't eat that unclean "],[2266.32,"food don't drink that King's Wine do we "],[2269.88,"obey it or do we H just take it all and "],[2274.2,"enjoy the luxuries well they abstained "],[2277.96,"and they lived in Babylon but they "],[2279.6,"maintained obedience to God and because "],[2281.32,"of that God blessed them and God "],[2283.28,"protected them but when they did what "],[2286.12,"happened you remember their lives were "],[2288.56,"in danger weren't they because "],[2290.68,"eventually Babylon will demand you to "],[2293.88,"worship the false gods they will demand "],[2296.28,"that you disobey God or else and while "],[2298.84,"Daniel and his friends miraculously were "],[2300.96,"saved from the fiery furnace and from "],[2303.2,"the Lion's Den many followers of Jesus "],[2307.56,"all through the history were not "],[2309.96,"miraculously saved verse number "],[2312.36,"six I saw the woman drunk with the blood "],[2315,"of the Saints with the blood of the "],[2316.76,"martyrs of "],[2318.12,"Jesus the blood of the Saints Old "],[2320.64,"Testament blood of the martyrs of Jesus "],[2322.36,"New Testament from Old Testament to New "],[2324.04,"Testament people die for their faith all "],[2326.88,"the way up even till today and most "],[2329.04,"definitely in the Great Tribulation "],[2331.48,"people are put to death for their faith "],[2333.36,"in Jesus and their rejection of Babylon "],[2336.72,"and that is why "],[2338.12,"Babylon is experiencing the final wrath "],[2342.6,"of "],[2343.92,"God some point but not right now so what "],[2347.72,"does that mean for us today what that's "],[2349.88,"great very exciting what that what are "],[2351.76,"we supposed to do with that well just "],[2353.08,"like Daniel and his friends just like "],[2355.72,"the apostles in Rome we too we living in "],[2359.48,"Babylon it's all around us it calls us "],[2363.04,"it allur us it's exciting it appeals to "],[2366.2,"our flesh our love us but it is the "],[2368.64,"broad road that leads to destruction and "],[2371.48,"we are commanded to love not the world "],[2374.68,"or the things that are in the world we "],[2376.96,"are to be in the world but not of the "],[2379.92,"world and we have to make a conscious "],[2382.2,"Choice every day to walk according to "],[2384.48,"the Holy Spirit and not fulfill the "],[2387.72,"desires of the Flesh and Paul gives us a "],[2390.08,"very detailed instructions on that in "],[2392.68,"turn to Galatians chapter 5 Galatians "],[2394.88,"chapter 5 read it with me very clear "],[2398.04,"instructions that Paul says to the "],[2400.32,"Galatians verse number "],[2402.8,"16 I say then walk in the spirits and "],[2406.4,"you will not fulfill the lust of the "],[2407.92,"flesh for the lust the flesh lust "],[2410.56,"against the spirit and the spirit "],[2412.04,"against the Flesh and these are contrary "],[2414.12,"to another one another so that you do "],[2416.32,"not do the things that you "],[2418.68,"wish Paul's very honest with that isn't "],[2420.96,"he oh Wretched Man that I am who can "],[2423.32,"save me of this body of sin the things I "],[2425.12,"want to do I don't do the things I don't "],[2427.88,"want to do I do who can relate to that "],[2431.96,"you know what's right and you yet you "],[2433.52,"have a hard time doing it but this is "],[2435.72,"what he's saying to "],[2437.36,"us if you're LED of the "],[2439.72,"spirit now the works of the flesh are "],[2442,"evident verse number 19 adultery "],[2444.72,"fornication uncleanliness lewdness "],[2446.76,"idolatry sorcery dissensions heresies "],[2449.32,"Envy murder drunkenness reeving and of "],[2452.68,"the like of which I told you before and "],[2454.96,"I tell you in times past that those who "],[2457.92,"practice such things do not inherit the "],[2460.96,"kingdom of God but in contrast the fruit "],[2464.16,"of the spirit love and joy and peace "],[2468.68,"patience kindness goodness faithfulness "],[2471.8,"gentleness it's how we're treating one "],[2473.8,"another and then "],[2476.32,"self-control against such there is no "],[2478.32,"law and those who are Christ have "],[2480.88,"crucified the flesh with the passions "],[2483.16,"and desires and we live in the spirit "],[2485.72,"let us walk in the spirit let us not be "],[2488.84,"conceited provoking one another and "],[2491.4,"envying one "],[2492.56,"another so one day babylon's going to be "],[2496.84,"destroyed but we will not we who walk in "],[2500.8,"the spirit will inherit the kingdom of "],[2504.12,"God as the LA fires vividly illustrate "],[2508.96,"to us the things of this world are "],[2511.48,"passing away one day everything will be "],[2514.48,"Tried by fire and if you're trusting in "],[2517.24,"money and possessions and Country and "],[2520.32,"insurance and some institution to put "],[2523.08,"your fire out it's all going to collapse "],[2525.28,"and it's all going to "],[2526.64,"burn this is what endures "],[2530.08,"forever this is your fire insurance that "],[2534.04,"you really need next week the call of "],[2537.4,"God is come out of Babylon my people but "],[2540.28,"you don't have to wait till next week "],[2542.04,"you can come out of sin you can stop "],[2544.04,"loving the world you can come to Jesus "],[2546.24,"and be saved you can come and be part of "],[2548.36,"the kingdom of heaven right now let's "],[2551.68,"bow together in prayer Lord Jesus we "],[2554.96,"just pray that someone today holy spirit "],[2557.92,"that you'd speak to them and their eyes "],[2559.24,"would be open "],[2561.56,"that they could see that the sin is just "],[2564.68,"leading to destruction and that it is "],[2567.36,"just nothing but a lie meanwhile all "],[2570.12,"that you promise eternal life is there "],[2574.12,"the hope of inheriting all things is "],[2576.08,"there for them if they would but trust "],[2578.24,"in you Jesus if they would but repent of "],[2581.04,"sin and turn to you and live according "],[2584.32,"to your word Lord help us to want to "],[2587.32,"Aspire to something so much better help "],[2589.72,"us to not get trapped in all of the "],[2591.68,"foolishness of this world and the lust "],[2593.88,"of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes "],[2595.72,"help us to turn our eyes upon you and "],[2597.84,"see how to love and care and serve one "],[2600.56,"another to see how trusting in you Jesus "],[2603.92,"sets us free and makes us makes us your "],[2607.16,"your children I pray that someone here "],[2608.88,"today will pray and ask for forgiveness "],[2611.2,"of sins and believe in you for eternal "],[2613.48,"life we pray all this in Jesus name amen "]]},{"id":"1a2THiVn6qg","name":"2025-01-19  The Destruction of Babylon (Pastor Rob McNutt)","date":"2025-01-19","transcript":[[21.6,"all right to start things off this "],[23.16,"morning I thought we ought to have a "],[24.92,"little exercise in "],[28.76,"transparency I'm I'm not a great "],[33.48,"intellect I'm not super skilled there's "],[35.8,"all kinds of things that other people "],[38.44,"know better than me subjects you know "],[41.76,"way more than I do on many people are "],[44.08,"doing a great deal of ministry and "],[46.36,"service to the people of this church and "],[48,"Community teaching the children the "],[49.88,"teens running the programs helping "],[52.64,"people in a time of need serving giving "],[55.96,"large sums of money in order for this "],[58.44,"church to accomplish all that we're "],[59.64,"attemp to do it requires a high level of "],[61.64,"commitment and sacrifice on behalf of "],[63.96,"the membership to make it all happen "],[67.24,"however for whatever reason I've been "],[69.48,"given the position of Pastor so I'm the "],[71.28,"guy who leads the church and I "],[72.6,"collaborate with the Elder the other "],[74.64,"leaders but they seem to take my "],[77.24,"recommendations seriously even though I "],[80.2,"am neither of great intellect or "],[83.6,"skill I see the challenge this presents "],[88,"I know my weaknesses and and I know I'm "],[90.68,"not the best person for the position and "],[92.56,"yet for some reason God saw fit to put "],[95.56,"us together and is blessing our efforts "],[99.08,"and God continues to work in and through "],[101.4,"US despite my "],[103.24,"shortcomings that's not a secret pretty "],[106.68,"much anyone who's been working and "],[107.96,"serving in this church for any length of "],[109.4,"time they would just say yeah yeah we we "],[111.56,"know that Pastor R but I think it's it's "],[114,"from time to time we it's appropriate to "],[116,"be transparent about that for the sake "],[118.92,"of new people that are joining you know "],[120.48,"the people who come to the meet and "],[121.92,"greet luncheon and also for like the "],[124.2,"20-year-olds who've grown up here "],[126.48,"they're coming into adulthood you know "],[128.76,"they need to realize that we all know "],[130.4,"that because sooner or later they're "],[132.12,"going to figure it out and I don't want "],[134.4,"anyone to think that we're pulling some "],[135.88,"bait and switch when they recognize my "],[139.08,"obvious deficiencies you know hey has "],[141.4,"anyone else noticed Pastor Rob's not "],[144.4,"really super "],[146.84,"smart he he he's really not phenomenally "],[152.44,"talented he seems to lack a little "],[156.8,"piety yeah like nobody said pastor Rob "],[161.72,"was good at any of that stuff you know "],[163.32,"just go read the bio on the website "],[167.24,"everyone here is working in and around "],[170.92,"my "],[171.88,"deficiencies this yet again is another "],[174.2,"one of those pieces of evidence that "],[176.24,"God's word is coming true before our "],[178.36,"very eyes because Paul said in 1 "],[180.48,"Corinthians God has chosen the foolish "],[182.24,"things of this world to shame the wise "],[185.6,"the God has chosen the weak things of "],[187.2,"this world to uh shame the mighty see "],[191.2,"that's me and that's one of the "],[192.76,"ingredients that makes up the recipe of "],[194.92,"success of Faith Bible Church if "],[196.8,"anything's working in this place God "],[199.72,"gets the glory as he should it's his "],[203.04,"church following his word doing the "],[206.28,"things that he said he would bless we're "],[208.2,"not inventing anything new here we're "],[210,"just following the manual and then the "],[212.52,"Holy Spirit speaks to people calls them "],[215.44,"challenges us helps us Overlook each "],[218.88,"other's faults and failures Keeps Us "],[221.68,"striving to love one another and to "],[224.6,"serve one another and we do all this in "],[227.2,"collaboration with one another to "],[229.32,"accomplish a common goal that "],[232.24,"everyone would hear the good news of "],[234.56,"Jesus Christ and hopefully trust in him "],[237.52,"we're trying to help everyone pursue God "],[239.84,"God's plans and purposes for their lives "],[242.44,"we believe Jesus one day is going to "],[244.56,"come back and all of his followers are "],[246.8,"going to inherit his kingdom and he will "],[249.12,"rule over all and you can be part of "],[251.84,"that Kingdom so that's some transparency "],[255.36,"about everything that we're trying to do "],[256.88,"here hopefully that's helpful as God's "],[259.2,"servants we want to be "],[261.24,"transparent the other side is not so "],[265.6,"forthcoming the word of God makes it "],[267.84,"very plain that we are struggling with "],[270.36,"three challenging "],[272.64,"forces our own sin nature which is "],[275.72,"called the flesh spiritual forces which "],[281,"we call the devil and demons and then "],[285.2,"something called the "],[287.2,"world the devil wants us to reject the "],[290.28,"true God who created us and worship him "],[293.88,"instead but he can't just openly tell "],[296.24,"you that he can't just be transparent "],[298.24,"because if people knew the fact nobody "],[300.52,"would follow him hey I'm the devil I'm a "],[304.2,"least lesser powerful being but I'm "],[307.16,"rebelling against the all powerful "],[308.64,"Creator God he's going to punish me for "],[310.52,"all of eternity for my Rebellion follow "],[313.36,"me instead of "],[315.4,"him right that's not going to sell so he "],[318.24,"has to lie and deceive people to follow "],[320.4,"him matter of fact he has to get people "],[322.64,"to follow him without even knowing that "],[324.76,"they're following him how is that "],[326.44,"possible by getting people to join "],[328.88,"something that he's controlling without "],[332,"them understanding that he's the one "],[334.2,"behind it what is this thing that he "],[338.32,"gets everyone to join and buy into that "],[341.8,"he's in control "],[343.44,"of the "],[345.16,"worlds the corrupt human governments "],[348.72,"institutions also known as "],[352.04,"Babylon it's a very big topic the world "],[355.32,"is this massive bloated evil system that "],[359.04,"controls everything and the devil runs "],[361.64,"it from the Shadows but Humanity built "],[364.4,"it for him and we let him control us "],[367.32,"through it there's your intro turning "],[370.72,"your copy of the word of God to "],[372.4,"Revelation chapter 17 Revelation chapter "],[378.68,"17 let's read about this imagery and "],[381.4,"then let's explain "],[383.32,"it verse number one then one of the "],[386.16,"Seven Angels who had the seven bows came "],[389.36,"and talked with me saying to me come I "],[392.04,"will show you the Judgment of the great "],[393.92,"Harlot who sits on the many wars with "],[396.8,"whom the kings of the earth commit "],[398.6,"fornication and the inhabitants of the "],[400.64,"earth were made drunk with the wine of "],[402.4,"her fornication so he carried me away in "],[404.68,"the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw "],[406.8,"a woman sitting on a Scarlet Beast which "],[409.28,"was full of names and blasphemies having "],[411.48,"seven heads and 10 horns the woman was "],[413.56,"AR raay in purple and Scarlet adorned "],[415.68,"with gold precious stones pearls having "],[418.92,"in her hand a golden cup full of the "],[421.96,"Abominations and the filthiness of her "],[424.6,"fornication and on her forehead a name "],[427.08,"was written mystery Babylon the great "],[430.16,"the mother of harlots and the "],[431.84,"Abominations of the earth I saw the "],[433.96,"woman drunk with the blood of the Saints "],[435.76,"and with the blood of the martyrs of "],[437.04,"Jesus and when I saw her I marveled with "],[440.88,"great amazement have you ever seen "],[442.56,"something so shocking it's hard not to "],[444.04,"look at it something big and powerful "],[446.32,"you know wild animals that are big and "],[447.92,"powerful we generally don't get "],[449.52,"anywhere's near them because it's too "],[451.48,"dangerous did you know the polar bears "],[453.36,"grow to 10t tall how would you like to "],[456.52,"be near like a polar bear rears up "],[458.04,"that's that's crazy or or maybe "],[461.44,"something uh that is very rich and "],[463.08,"extravagant you know you just stop it's "],[464.96,"like woo that's just that's just "],[468.16,"breathtaking some people are so "],[470.52,"beautiful they're stunning and you can't "],[472.48,"help look at them I know I have that "],[478.28,"problem and what about what about "],[480.92,"something dark and Sinister I I if "],[483.6,"something or someone is ominous looking "],[486.04,"you can't help but pay attention to them "],[488.44,"because when something's threatening our "],[490.08,"senses intuitively lock in on it you're "],[491.8,"like you know that that could be "],[492.96,"dangerous we need to we need to pay "],[494.84,"close attention to that John sees all of "],[498.72,"these tied together in one "],[501.84,"picture John marveles with great "],[504.2,"amazement it says here at this woman "],[506.88,"riding the beast amazement is the Greek "],[510.2,"word th th madzo it means shocked amazed "],[515.52,"what exactly is "],[517.28,"this the woman called a harlot described "],[521.24,"as a harlot sensual Rich decadent drunk "],[524.84,"on blood riding a seven head torn Beast "],[529.68,"who's this woman what is this Beast "],[531.36,"how'd she get up there what does that "],[534.2,"mean fortunately for John and us an "],[536.72,"angel told him exactly what he's looking "],[538.28,"at look at verse number 18 chap "],[541.2,"17:8 the woman who you saw is that great "],[546.44,"City that Reigns over the kings of the "],[548.76,"earth so it's symbolism its imagery it's "],[551.56,"a great "],[552.84,"City that's it very simple in the city's "],[555.76,"name is "],[557.84,"Babylon as we learned last week the "],[560.04,"imagery of the woman in this scripture "],[562.2,"implies a religious system as the church "],[565.08,"is called the bride of Christ false "],[567.4,"religions in the Old Testament are "],[569,"connected to adultery and fornication so "],[571.6,"a harlot communicates this city has a "],[574.4,"false religion a false belief also it's "],[576.96,"very wealthy as it's it's described with "],[579.32,"the gold and the and the and the pearls "],[581.6,"and the precious stones and it's also "],[583.36,"guilty of killing the people of God so "],[585.28,"this false religion has power over the "],[587.92,"kings of the earth it did in the past it "],[590.04,"does in the present it will in the "],[591.24,"future what religion has power over all "],[595.04,"the Earth past present and "],[597.88,"future Catholic "],[600.12,"ISM "],[601.96,"Islam secular "],[605.04,"humanism I'll give you a hint Jesus said "],[608.44,"in Matthew chapter 6 no one can serve "],[611,"two masters he'll either hate one and "],[613.6,"love the other or he'll be loyal to one "],[615.16,"despise the other you cannot serve both "],[617.08,"God and Mammon that's a transliteration "],[620.44,"of a Greek word mammos it means wealth "],[625.2,"riches "],[626.88,"money Treasures "],[629.48,"earlier on in that chapter Jesus saido "],[631.88,"not lay up for yourselves Treasures on "],[634,"Earth where moth and rust destroy and "],[637.08,"thieves come in and steal and La fires "],[639.4,"burn it all down it's not in the verse "],[641.52,"but you know same thing lay up for "],[643.52,"yourselves Treasures in Heaven where "],[645.88,"neither moth nor rust destroy and "],[647.32,"thieves do not break and steal for where "],[648.64,"your treasure is there your heart will "],[651.56,"be "],[653.48,"also see nobody loves the devil nobody "],[658.68,"is really that interested in serving him "],[660.88,"but people do love "],[663.28,"money and the things that money can buy "],[665.68,"you that's his bait that's what our "],[669.28,"flesh wants what money gets us people "],[672.48,"love serve worship wealth and riches and "],[676.24,"Paul writes and warns us in 1 Timothy "],[678.52,"chapter 6 The Love of Money is the root "],[682.2,"of all kinds of evil for by which some "],[684.8,"have strayed from the faith and I "],[687.2,"thought about that even as you were "],[688.32,"sharing that prayer request so often the "],[690.36,"things of this world help us make us "],[692.68,"stray from the faith and Pierce "],[695.4,"themselves through with many "],[696.88,"Sorrows the Love of Money people stray "],[700.08,"from the faith instead of believing in "],[702.28,"God and putting their devotion and their "],[703.88,"faith in the wealth and the riches and "],[706.68,"that's how Babylon is described that's "],[710.08,"the description look at chapter 18 verse "],[711.76,"number n as we see the details of what "],[715.92,"Babylon is verse number nine the kings "],[718.56,"of the Earth "],[720.76,"Revelation 18:9 commit a fornication and "],[723.6,"live luxuriously with her will weep and "],[726.36,"lament for her when they see the smoke "],[729.16,"of her burning standing at a distance "],[731.4,"for fear of her torment saying alas alas "],[733.84,"the great City Babylon the mighty City "],[736.2,"for in one hour your judgment has come "],[738.44,"and the merchants of the earth will weep "],[739.88,"and mourn over her for No One buys their "],[742.24,"merchandise anymore merchandise of gold "],[745.32,"silver precious stones pearls fine linen "],[748.44,"purple silk Scarlet every kind of Citron "],[751.24,"wood every kind of object of ivory every "],[754,"kind of object the most precious wood "],[756.2,"bronze iron marble cinnamons incense "],[759.6,"fragrant oil and frankincense wine and "],[762.16,"oil fine flour wheat cattle sheeps "],[764.88,"horses "],[766.68,"chariots bodies and Souls of men are all "],[770.56,"sold in Babylon well we know all about "],[773,"that don't we Jennifer bodies and souls "],[775.08,"being sold the fruits that your soul "],[778.72,"long "],[779.64,"for have gone from you and all the "],[782.28,"things which are rich and Splendid have "],[784.84,"gone from you and you shall find them no "],[786.92,"more at all the merchants of these "],[789.72,"things who became Rich by her will stand "],[791.6,"at a distance for fear of her torment "],[793.16,"weeping and wailing and saying alas alas "],[795.32,"that great city that was clothed in the "],[796.96,"Linens purple and Scarlet adorned with "],[798.8,"the gold and the stones and the pearls "],[801.6,"for one hour such great riches came to "],[803.84,"nothing every shipmaster all who travel "],[807.52,"by sea Sailors and as many trade on the "],[809.76,"sea stood at a distance cried aloud when "],[812.68,"they saw the smoke of her burning saying "],[814.44,"what is like this great City they threw "],[817.64,"dust on their heads and they cried "],[818.88,"weeping and wailing saying alas alas "],[821.04,"that great City in which all who had "],[823.24,"ships of the sea became Rich by her "],[825.52,"wealth for in those hour she is made "],[830.48,"desolate everyone loves Babylon because "],[833.24,"of the wealth and everyone Mourns its "],[835.32,"destruction because it means they're all "],[837.28,"financially wiped out "],[840.28,"so with "],[841.92,"that understanding let me expound on "],[845.76,"this for a "],[847.16,"moment the devil has studied us and he "],[851.52,"knows what our flesh desires What We "],[854.2,"crave what we lust for most of what we "],[857,"need and want is available to us through "],[860.4,"the disciplines of working hard and "],[862.64,"serving others if we want to be loved "],[865.04,"and accepted we can serve others help "],[867.44,"others through caring about other people "],[870.16,"people recognize the kindness and they "],[871.88,"reciprocate it scripture says to have a "],[873.96,"friend you need to be a friend love and "],[877.28,"it you will be loved give and it will be "],[880.28,"given to you well the same's true with "],[882.44,"physical needs if I want food or some "],[885.24,"physical item that brings me some "],[887.4,"creature comfort then I have to put some "],[889.76,"effort into obtaining the goods or "],[892.64,"making the item right I think I'd like a "],[895.56,"new sweater well I better get busy "],[898.04,"knitting one if I don't know how to knit "],[900.28,"I better I better learn how to knit if "],[903.28,"someone else is already good at knitting "],[905.72,"then you know maybe I can get them to "],[907.68,"make one for me if I can exchange it for "],[910.72,"something that they want that I have "],[912.96,"most everything we desire is available "],[915,"to us through the disciplines of working "],[916.68,"hard and serving others that's what a "],[918.6,"job is right you're trading your skills "],[921.4,"and effort away for money that you can "],[923.6,"use in exchange for someone else's goods "],[925.8,"and services that's the basics of the "],[927.88,"economy nothing wrong with any of that "],[931.16,"money in and of itself is neither good "],[933.64,"or bad God made some of his most "],[935.88,"Faithful Servants very wealthy Abraham "],[938.48,"job David Solomon the most wealthiest "],[941.84,"person ever to live the problem arises "],[945.76,"when we love money when we love stuff "],[949.48,"more than people when we love ourselves "],[952.56,"more than others this is the flesh at "],[955.84,"work our sin nature which we're all born "],[958.64,"with "],[959.52,"these attitudes get us into trouble you "],[962.04,"covet and you lust and you want "],[963.32,"something that belongs to someone else "],[965.16,"and they don't really want to give it to "],[966.4,"you they don't want to sell it to you "],[967.6,"maybe because you don't have anything "],[969.28,"they want maybe you didn't work hard "],[971.72,"enough to get enough money maybe you "],[973.24,"haven't de developed your skills to be "],[975.48,"in high demand and instead of working "],[978.24,"hard to gain the item or being content "],[980.76,"with what you do have you get upset as "],[983.44,"you can't get your way and that is when "],[986.36,"the Devil comes along and he offers you "],[988.6,"the short shortcut hey here's how you "],[991.56,"can get what you want you just take it "],[995.36,"you just steal it right and if anybody "],[998.6,"confronts you you just you just lie "],[1000.64,"about that and uh if that person "],[1002.96,"persists well you just threaten them "],[1004.4,"with violence get other people to join "],[1006.24,"you and you could gang up on them and if "],[1008.04,"they try to fight back you know what you "],[1009.16,"can just kill "],[1010.16,"them and the devil uses the lust of the "],[1012.8,"flesh to tempt us to sin against God and "],[1015.16,"to one another and that messes up our "],[1017.36,"lives because now we're in all this conf "],[1019.2,"with others and this messes up other "],[1020.76,"people's lives because now they're "],[1021.88,"reacting to the offenses that we have "],[1024,"caused and the peace and love is gone "],[1026.88,"the cooperation is gone and there's just "],[1028.88,"nothing about fighting and "],[1031.4,"wars and worst of all messes up our "],[1034.4,"relationship with God because he's going "],[1036.6,"to judge us for all this "],[1039,"sin now the average person you come "],[1042.52,"across they're not they don't really "],[1044.28,"want that much conflict they they don't "],[1046.24,"want to steal and kill people uh nor are "],[1049.56,"they influential enough to get a whole "],[1051,"bunch of people to join them to create a "],[1052.6,"gang and gang up on other people and "],[1055.32,"when people understand that they're "],[1056.6,"going to have to answer to God for how "],[1057.96,"they live their lives it kind of makes "],[1059.08,"them want to behave themselves but there "],[1061.4,"was this one guy in particular that "],[1063.92,"noticed he was the strongest person in "],[1067.52,"the world and he could get people to "],[1069.92,"submit to him and his name was Nimrod "],[1073.88,"the mighty Hunter there's a new Marvel "],[1077.68,"movie coming out called called Craven "],[1079.36,"the hunter haven't seen it this is not a "],[1081.76,"re endorsement but you know back in the "],[1084.24,"day I used to collect Spider-Man comics "],[1085.8,"so I know who Craven is he's the alpha "],[1088.96,"he hunts and he kills with his bare "],[1090.64,"hands the most dangerous animals in the "],[1092.64,"world 10 foot polar bears lions bull "],[1095.88,"elephants but Craven doesn't just hunt "],[1097.96,"animals he hunts people and he kills "],[1099.92,"anyone who defies him that's he's a "],[1101.8,"villain and uh that's what that's who "],[1105.84,"Nimrod was in the Old Testament "],[1107.68,"Revelation chapter or Genesis chapter 10 "],[1109.96,"coming off of the Ark after the great "],[1111.88,"flood there was this one family that "],[1113.72,"just grew and multiplied and the great "],[1116,"grandson of Noah realized I'm the "],[1118.56,"strongest dude on the planet Nimrod the "],[1121.8,"mighty Hunter not a hunter of deer or "],[1124.32,"ducks a hunter of people he was the "],[1126.72,"alpha he overpowered everybody and he "],[1129.28,"took control of society and people "],[1131.12,"submitted to him and he built cities in "],[1134.28,"a society where the strong ruled the "],[1138.32,"weak and due to his power he became very "],[1140.96,"arrogant so arrogant he did not fear God "],[1144,"remember he was the great grandson of "],[1145.52,"Noah the grandson of ham who survived "],[1147.84,"the great flood so he knew all about God "],[1149.96,"wiping out mankind for their wickedness "],[1151.68,"he did not care he rebelled against the "],[1153.68,"decrees of God and created a religion "],[1156.4,"and a society that gave power to the few "],[1159.72,"to rule the many the powerful would rule "],[1163.16,"because they were Superior and even "],[1164.84,"Godlike and he claimed himself to be a "],[1167.8,"god "],[1169.36,"Babylon is the first city that he built "],[1172.52,"and once Nimrod built the system people "],[1175.28,"perpetually figured out how to use it "],[1177.4,"grow it and expand it so like Nimrod can "],[1181.36,"personally overpower people who defy him "],[1183.32,"so everyone will obey him and fall in "],[1184.96,"line but since you there's a lot of "],[1186.48,"people in the world that he wants to "],[1187.8,"organize and Rule he has to delegate "],[1190.4,"someone to rule on his behalf and so "],[1192.96,"he'll reward that person with riches in "],[1195.92,"loyalty and so now we have a way to "],[1198.72,"transfer power to other people there's a "],[1201.08,"mechanism that controls and manages the "],[1204.24,"masses it's the consolidates wealth and "],[1206.72,"power and puts it into the hands of a "],[1208.44,"few it's stronger than any one person "],[1211.12,"it's the will of people "],[1213.76,"United "],[1215.4,"Society why does anyone want to be a "],[1217.48,"part of that because it pays mankind "],[1221.36,"built an unjust society and that was "],[1225.04,"excellent for the devil see the devil's "],[1227.24,"not physical so can't do anything "],[1229.64,"physically to you he can't make "],[1232,"something physical that he you want that "],[1233.64,"he'll give it to you what he needs is "],[1235.76,"people to do things for him do things "],[1239.76,"that he wants them to do on his behalf "],[1241.48,"so Nimrod created a system and then he "],[1243.48,"exploits it within this order people can "],[1246.36,"become great and have whatever they want "],[1248.84,"they can try to rule the world they "],[1250.48,"write the laws the decrees that everyone "],[1252.76,"now has to be abiding by all the devil "],[1256.08,"had to do was influence his people to "],[1258.04,"take control of that system so powerful "],[1260.32,"Kings could lead armies out to conquer "],[1263.16,"other people take their land their "],[1264.96,"livestock enslave their people to work "],[1266.92,"to build their Empires ancient empires "],[1269.96,"were all about taking over other people "],[1272.6,"enslaving folks so they could "],[1274.64,"consolidate power and grow wealth many "],[1277.48,"people got hurt by it but on the other "],[1278.76,"hand a lot of people profited from it "],[1280.52,"those people wanted it if they if their "],[1282.16,"Nation their country is winning they get "],[1284.2,"wealthy and they were happy to "],[1285.8,"participate in a society where the "],[1287.44,"strong ruled the "],[1289.16,"week this is not at all what God "],[1293.32,"wants Jesus explains very clearly what "],[1296.76,"God wants you read The Sermon on the "],[1299.12,"Mount what did what did Jesus talk about "],[1300.88,"serving loving the Ten Commandments "],[1303.72,"don't CET don't lie don't steal don't "],[1307.32,"kill work hard enjoy the fruits of your "],[1309.56,"own labor help weak people show some "],[1311.64,"hospitality and at the end of the day be "],[1313.92,"content after all life is more than "],[1317.4,"physical life is more than food or drink "],[1322,"it's more than clothes or houses it's "],[1325.16,"more than money and power and lands "],[1329.96,"there is a spiritual side of our lives "],[1332.68,"really thank Corey for getting up here "],[1334.64,"and he he right away even in the "],[1336.24,"announcements connected we're doing this "],[1338.04,"for physical help and spiritual help "],[1340.92,"there's a spiritual side to our lives it "],[1343.36,"was explained to the nation of Israel "],[1345.56,"how to be physical beings living on "],[1347.4,"Earth but separated from the the evils "],[1348.96,"of the World by staying devoted to their "],[1351.84,"God they would be both physically and "],[1353.64,"spiritually blessed and God would dwell "],[1355.12,"with them and he would Prosper their "],[1356.92,"land if they abided by his laws and they "],[1359.2,"rejected the false gods and the "],[1360.56,"corruption of the other nations these "],[1362.68,"other Empires Babylon and then they all "],[1364.68,"those who rose up they tried to destroy "],[1366.24,"Israel but God would protect "],[1368.6,"them but the children of Israel have "],[1370.76,"their own individual sin natures and "],[1373.6,"everybody struggling with their flesh so "],[1376.88,"the fertility gods of Babylon on the sex "],[1379.36,"practices of the Gentiles the greed and "],[1382.24,"all the power is too big of a draw "],[1385.6,"people broke the laws of God this is the "],[1387.68,"summary of the whole Old Testament right "],[1389.36,"people broke the laws of God broke the "],[1391.4,"covenants so God withheld His blessings "],[1395.04,"and his "],[1395.92,"protection Babylon and all the empires "],[1399.48,"all the false religions all the Hostile "],[1401.32,"worldviews that it spawn engulfed "],[1404.68,"humanity and that's what the New "],[1406.44,"Testament is calling the "],[1409.64,"world all of humanity is lost born with "],[1413.72,"a sin nature trapped in a world of sin "],[1417.2,"controlled by the devil victims of "],[1419.88,"greedy lustful evil people with selfish "],[1423.4,"Ambitions and bad intentions Empires "],[1426.24,"raiding lands enslaving people men "],[1428.64,"working like animals until they died "],[1430.6,"women being used and abused children "],[1432.16,"born in poverty with no hope of getting "],[1434,"out even the people with the money and "],[1436.2,"the power were victims you know the the "],[1438.48,"Emperors routinely got assassinated "],[1440.32,"right they were paranoid of who was "],[1442.48,"waiting to take their power often they "],[1444.24,"killed their own family members or were "],[1445.8,"killed by their own family members "],[1447.32,"nobody was safe the greed and the lust "],[1449.64,"fuels people to do all kinds of vile "],[1451.4,"hateful things one to another the love "],[1453.32,"of money is the root of all "],[1457.6,"evil and from Bible times till today "],[1461.04,"nothing's changed people are controlled "],[1463.56,"by their vices they get the money to buy "],[1466,"the stuff that feeds their lust people "],[1468.08,"sell their bodies for Fame and Fortune "],[1471.56,"then they're so racked with guilt they "],[1473.56,"go to drugs to numb the pain and a "],[1476.64,"vicious cycle of self-destruction the "],[1479.4,"wealthy ignore the needs of others "],[1481.84,"indulge their flesh while people suffer "],[1484.2,"and die Wars are fought for land and "],[1487.4,"resources to make somebody rich and "],[1490.84,"Powerful the rich get richer the top 1% "],[1493.48,"own everything and the poor get poorer "],[1494.88,"more desperate but everyone in this "],[1497.56,"system rich or poor they all suffer the "],[1501.32,"same fate what happens to all everybody "],[1505.8,"dies the physical life runs out and once "],[1508.84,"you "],[1509.84,"die everyone stands before God in "],[1512.64,"judgment and the person who dies in "],[1514.72,"their sins is lost forever and this is "],[1517.6,"what I meant when I said the devil does "],[1520.04,"not want "],[1521.04,"transparency this world system This Love "],[1523.8,"of Money sex and power this keeps us "],[1526.44,"distracted from knowing our cre creat "],[1528.64,"her from

"],[1601.2,"that intell you know talented so you "],[1603.44,"ain't worth the "],[1605.84,"time somebody should amen that that was "],[1608.12,"a perfect that a perfect shot has to get "],[1611.32,"a shot in there people love the world "],[1614.56,"love the money because that makes the "],[1616.32,"flesh happy "],[1618.88,"but when we start paying attention to "],[1620.08,"our spiritual lives we're not so easily "],[1622.92,"distracted by the "],[1624.32,"physical the world Gorges the flesh the "],[1628.32,"physical and dulls the spiritual and "],[1631.16,"that's exactly what the devil wants he "],[1632.76,"wants us spiritually weak dumbed down "],[1635.48,"weighed down by the cares of this world "],[1637.24,"so that we will not know or understand "],[1639.28,"or attend to our spiritual "],[1641.4,"well-beings it's the Love of Money the "],[1644.84,"worship of money that gets us "],[1649.36,"I will never forget "],[1651.2,"911 after the nation was attacked and "],[1654.52,"the president was asked what should we "],[1656.76,"do as Americans to help our country in a "],[1659.16,"time of need Mr President and he said "],[1662,"don't stop buying stuff keep that "],[1665.12,"economy rolling that's a very telling "],[1667.08,"answer don't you "],[1668.24,"think I think that was a perfect time to "],[1670.28,"tell Americans you know what we should "],[1671.88,"repent we should pray put our faith in "],[1675,"God life is short and fragile "],[1678.76,"no instead prop up the God of "],[1683.16,"wealth chapter uh 17 verse number "],[1688.32,"seven that was just a "],[1693.52,"tiate big picture you got to explain it "],[1696.4,"so the angel said to me this is chapter "],[1697.84,"17 ver 7 why did you why did you Marvel "],[1701.4,"I will tell you the mystery of the woman "],[1703,"and the Beast carries her uh which has "],[1706.36,"the seven heads and the 10 horns and the "],[1707.8,"Beast which which you saw was and is not "],[1709.4,"and ascends down to the bottomless pit "],[1710.84,"and goes into predition those who dwell "],[1712.72,"on the earth will Marvel whose names are "],[1714.6,"not written in the Book of Life from the "],[1716,"foundation of the world when they see "],[1717.92,"the Beast that was and is not yet is "],[1720.64,"here is the mind which has wisdom the "],[1722.96,"seven heads are the seven mountains "],[1725.24,"mountains are uh Kingdoms in scripture "],[1727.36,"it's imagery on which the S the woman "],[1729.68,"sits there is also seven Kings five have "],[1732.24,"fallen one is and one is not yet to come "],[1735.6,"and when he comes he must continue for a "],[1737.28,"short time the be that was and is not he "],[1739.36,"himself also is the eth and is of the "],[1741.36,"seventh and he goes into predition the T "],[1743.32,"horns which you saw are 10 Kings who "],[1745.08,"have not who have receive no Kingdom as "],[1747.08,"of yet but they receive Authority for "],[1749,"one hour as kings with the Beast these "],[1752,"are of one mind and they will give their "],[1754.52,"power and authority to the Beast these "],[1756.88,"will make war with the lamb and the lamb "],[1759.04,"will overcome them for he is who's the "],[1761.16,"lamb Lord of lords and King of Kings "],[1763.64,"Jesus Christ and those who are with him "],[1765.84,"are called the faithful and and the "],[1769.08,"chosen then he said to me the waters "],[1772.12,"which you saw where the Harlot sits are "],[1774.44,"the multitudes the peoples the Nations "],[1776.4,"the tongues and the T horns which you "],[1778.32,"saw on the Beast these will hate the "],[1780.6,"Harlot make her desolate naked eat her "],[1783.44,"with flesh and burn her with fire and "],[1786.04,"God will put it into their hearts to "],[1787.6,"fulfill his purposes to be of one mind "],[1789.56,"to give their Kingdom to the Beast until "],[1791.44,"the words of God are "],[1794.48,"fulfilled we covered pretty well all of "],[1797.16,"this several times times the Beast is a "],[1800.04,"symbolic depiction of all the past "],[1802.08,"present and future ungodly empires of "],[1804.72,"mankind used by sat the last great "],[1807.16,"Empire during the Great Tribulation is a "],[1809.64,"continuation of all of them all the "],[1811.92,"kings joined together the 10 Kings the "],[1814.36,"ten horns give their power to one leader "],[1818.04,"a new Nimrod and we Al often refer to "],[1820.88,"him as the Antichrist in verse number "],[1823.68,"eight it drives us back to it connects "],[1826.72,"us back to chapter 13 "],[1828.48,"where we learned that the Beast refers "],[1830.76,"to a leader of this world Empire so it's "],[1834.24,"a it's a it's an infrastructure but it's "],[1836.56,"also this one guy who Rises up to lead "],[1839.12,"it and he controls everyone we learned "],[1841.56,"specifically in Revelation chapter 13 he "],[1844.48,"controls everyone with a new economic "],[1847.76,"system verse number 16 of chapter 13 if "],[1851,"you want to look at that Revelation "],[1853.24,"13:16 he causes all small and great rich "],[1856.92,"and poor free and slave to receive a "],[1859.4,"mark on their right hand and on their "],[1861.36,"forehead and that no one may buy or sell "],[1865.56,"except the one who is the Mark or the "],[1867.72,"name of the Beast or the number of his "],[1870.52,"name it's what is being built "],[1874,"now the globalist plan is to crash the "],[1877.6,"American dollar and bring in a new "],[1879.72,"digital currency everyone will get an "],[1882.76,"automatic basic income you'll get "],[1886.04,"chipped marked "],[1888.44,"and you can participate once you sign up "],[1890.32,"you're going to get the money if you "],[1892.48,"don't you're not going to be in the "],[1894.32,"system and you won't be able to buy or "],[1895.96,"sell this detail in Revelation 13 "],[1899.84,"reinforces our interpretation that "],[1901.72,"Babylon is a corrupt Society everyone "],[1905.8,"sells themselves into for the love of "],[1908.32,"money but just like the LA fires "],[1911.52,"Illustrated to us it can all burn and "],[1915.4,"God is going to destroy this system "],[1918.24,"that's what chapter 161 17 18 and 19 is "],[1922,"telling us about the destruction so "],[1924.36,"right in the middle of the destruction "],[1926.04,"and for new people coming to church "],[1928.04,"sorry right in the middle of burning it "],[1930.32,"all "],[1931.08,"down but verse 15 and 16 this is a new "],[1934.32,"detail we didn't cover this this seems "],[1935.76,"kind of confusing I don't know if you "],[1937.08,"caught this and he said the waters which "],[1939.56,"you saw where the Harlot sits are many "],[1942.04,"people multitudes Nations tongues the 10 "],[1944.4,"horns you saw on the beasts they will "],[1946.64,"hate the Harlot make her desolate naked "],[1949.08,"eat her flesh and burn her with "],[1951.12,"fire that that's that's that's different "],[1953.96,"why why does the why did all these "],[1956.28,"kingdoms why does the Beast want to "],[1957.84,"destroy the woman the false religion why "],[1960.24,"does it want to destroy the money system "],[1962.96,"doesn't really say in the text but I got "],[1965.72,"a theory you want to hear it yes so you "],[1969.88,"still awake all right we got "],[1972.28,"time it goes back to how we started this "],[1974.96,"sermon when we talked about transparency "],[1978.08,"Jesus is very transparent about his "],[1980.16,"plans we are very transparent about what "],[1983.32,"the faith teaches meanwhile the devil "],[1985.2,"cannot be transparent he has to lie to "],[1987.16,"people and he has to bribe them and "],[1989.28,"since people love "],[1990.96,"money they'll take it but they don't "],[1994.08,"love him people worship money and they "],[1997,"Glory what it brings themselves they "],[1999,"don't worship the devil they don't "],[2001.52,"praise the devil that's ultimately what "],[2003.72,"he wants and he never gets it he always "],[2006.6,"has to stay in the shadow "],[2008.28,"meanwhile Babylon overshadows him and "],[2010.76,"steals all his glory the Beast empowered "],[2014.68,"by Satan wants to be exalted adored as a "],[2018.68,"God because people truly love him not "],[2022.2,"because they're paid "],[2024.08,"to but a harlot's love is not real you "],[2028.8,"gotta you got to pay for it so I think "],[2032.36,"this detail shows us the mind of Satan "],[2034.36,"where he really hates having to bless "],[2037.24,"people with money and power sharing that "],[2040.12,"he resents that meanwhile God the father "],[2043.32,"Jesus Christ shares he wants to share "],[2046.48,"with his children because he loves us "],[2049.52,"like like at Christmas time you want "],[2051.48,"your children everyone to be there at "],[2053.56,"home together and you want them to get "],[2055.8,"all these wonderful gifts you bought and "],[2058.08,"all this great food that Mom baked right "],[2061.4,"and you want them there to laugh and "],[2063.04,"play and enjoy all that you provided "],[2065.88,"that's our heavenly father he wants to "],[2067.96,"share to bless to heal for us all to be "],[2072,"one with him he has he wants to heal us "],[2076.48,"from our sin nature our flesh that "],[2079.28,"craves the world he wants to destroy "],[2083.28,"this evil unjust world that keeps "],[2085.84,"drawing Us in away from him and he's "],[2088.48,"going to imprison the devil and that's "],[2090.48,"what the Book of Revelation is going to "],[2092,"conclude with all of that is where we're "],[2095.16,"going the transparency of all this is so "],[2099.2,"that you can know what's going on and "],[2102.28,"you can use this information to decide "],[2104.64,"how you will live your life serving God "],[2107.48,"or serving money which is your god which "],[2112.28,"one do you "],[2114.52,"do practically speaking your calendar "],[2118.28,"and your bank statements tell the story "],[2121.96,"if you invest no time and money into "],[2124.32,"building the kingdom of God then you're "],[2126.48,"loving the money "],[2128.6,"so I highly recommend you sign up for "],[2130.2,"the financial peace class and learn how "],[2133,"to practically change your approach to "],[2134.92,"money find the biblical way to handle it "],[2138.24,"I highly recommend you sign up for the "],[2139.6,"new members class and learn how to start "],[2141.52,"serving the kingdom of "],[2144.76,"God we have this expression when there's "],[2148.6,"something that we really want to do "],[2150.68,"something we're excited to be a part of "],[2152.92,"maybe I don't know like a a wedding or a "],[2156.12,"lifechanging event "],[2158.32,"right uh something of highest important "],[2160.92,"importance to us and we'll say oh I "],[2162.84,"won't miss it for "],[2164.44,"the I wouldn't miss it for the world but "],[2168.04,"that's exactly what many people are "],[2169.64,"doing they're missing inheriting the "],[2172.12,"kingdom of heaven and eternal life and "],[2175.12,"they're missing it because they're so "],[2176.28,"distracted by the things of this world "],[2179.52,"what does it profit a man to gain the "],[2182.12,"whole world and lose his "],[2186,"soul let's save some Souls today every "],[2190.08,"head bowed every eye closed worship "],[2192.84,"teams coming back up to sing lead us in "],[2195.6,"one final song of "],[2197.08,"worship before they do as always the "],[2200.8,"application of information is what do I "],[2205.12,"do with this how does it change my "],[2209.12,"life and the word of God is sharp and "],[2211.68,"powerful and quick and it can cut "],[2213.08,"through the very core it can turn the "],[2215.56,"lights on in the dark places can show "],[2218,"you the things that you are so "],[2219.72,"distracted by the things of this World

penalty so that "],[2231,"you could be reconciled to God so that "],[2233.68,"you could be in a right relationship "],[2235.24,"with him if you believe on Jesus Christ "],[2237.76,"you will be saved

the "],[22.84,"word of God and turn to Revelation chap "],[25.52,"18 this morning as we continue on in "],[28.8,"this study through the book of "],[30.04,"Revelation for the uh let's read uh "],[32.52,"verses 1-8 and then we'll make some "],[35.36,"observations Revelation 18:1 after these "],[38.48,"SE after these things I saw another "],[41.4,"angel coming down from heaven having "],[43.68,"great Authority and the Earth was "],[47.12,"illuminated with his glory he cried "],[50.04,"mightily with a loud voice saying "],[52.12,"Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen "],[54.92,"and has become a Dwelling Place of "],[57.28,"demons a prison of every f spirit and a "],[60.96,"cage for every unclean and hateful bird "],[64.36,"for all the nations have drunk the wine "],[66.84,"of the wrath of her fornication the "],[68.48,"kings of the Earth have committed "],[69.76,"fornication with her and the merchants "],[71.56,"of the Earth have become rich through "],[73.2,"the abundance of her luxury I heard "],[75.68,"another voice from the heaven saying "],[77,"come out of her my people lest you share "],[79.48,"in her sins and lest you receive of her "],[82,"plagues for her sins have reached to "],[84.28,"heaven and God has remembered her "],[87.52,"iniquities render to her just as she "],[90.08,"rendered to you and repay her double "],[92.44,"according to her works in the cup which "],[94.24,"she has mixed mix double for her in the "],[98,"measure that was glor in the measure "],[99.92,"that she glorified herself and lived "],[102.32,"luxuriously in the same measure give her "],[104.64,"torment and sorrow for she says in her "],[106.92,"heart I sit as a queen and am no Widow "],[110.84,"and will not see sorrow therefore her "],[113.64,"plague will come in one day death and "],[115.64,"mourning and famine and she will be "],[118.56,"utterly burned with fire for the for "],[121.76,"strong is the Lord God who judged "],[125,"her for the last two weeks we have been "],[127.52,"studying about the future destruction of "],[130.12,"something John in Revelation refers to "],[133.2,"as Babylon through this study of the "],[136.2,"imagery God is using and the "],[137.88,"explanations of the symbolism found in "],[140.08,"the other passages of scripture we have "],[142.44,"learned that Babylon is really a culture "],[145.24,"a worldview a religion that is taken "],[147.96,"over most of humanity according to the "],[150.36,"Book of Genesis it had its beginning "],[152.44,"with a dictator named Nimrod Nimrod had "],[155.72,"a personal philosophy that since he was "],[158.52,"the mightiest person on Earth he could "],[161.76,"take control he set it to prove his "],[163.68,"Greatness by building cities and ruling "],[166.08,"over the general population he built the "],[168.36,"first postf flood cities of the ancient "],[171.08,"world in Mesopotamia the first one he "],[173.44,"built was Babel Babylon it was the place "],[178.56,"where the people decided to build a "],[180.44,"tower to heaven to make a name for "],[183.32,"themselves now if building a mere Tower "],[186.4,"was such a great offense to God pretty "],[188.28,"much every civilization would have have "],[190.76,"incited God's Wrath there is something "],[192.88,"more to this Tower of Babel that meets "],[194.88,"the eye but not many details are given "],[197.32,"in Genesis about what specifically the "],[199.92,"people were attempting to do however "],[202.8,"since God saw this as an act of "],[204.76,"Disobedience it's easy to piece together "],[208,"their intentions nimrod and Humanity "],[210.88,"under his leadership was exalting "],[214.44,"themselves question what's wrong with "],[217.4,"that what's wrong with self-exaltation "],[220.04,"what's wrong with Humanity wanting to "],[222.04,"build a great culture what's wrong with "],[224.44,"wanting to be the best the richest and "],[227.12,"enjoying all the things that money can "],[228.92,"buy what's wrong with the strong ruling "],[231.96,"the "],[233.96,"weak these are very relevant questions "],[237.08,"for us today as we swing hard toward W "],[240.12,"being a nation that will Implement a "],[242.08,"merit-based "],[244.16,"system is there any problems with being "],[247.8,"a "],[248.76,"meritocracy the strongest the richest "],[251,"the smartest will the most influential "],[254.32,"will "],[255.12,"rule what could be the "],[257.2,"challenges I mean it is better than an "],[261,"idiocracy where the dumb down masses are "],[263.52,"influenced by to follow stupid people "],[265.92,"with no skills or talents just dumb "],[267.6,"ideas that do not actually work and "],[270.04,"result in everything burning to the "],[271.28,"ground I mean we have literally been "],[272.8,"living in that for the last little bit "],[275.2,"so a meritocracy is a hard pendulum "],[278,"swing away from the unscientific "],[280.36,"foolishness that has metastasized itself "],[282.32,"in our culture and is currently a "],[284.92,"fullblown mental health "],[287.72,"crisis to view it as controversial to "],[290.72,"say there is only two genders is "],[293,"evidence of the Mental Health crisis I'm "],[295,"referring to to hire people to save you "],[299,"from a fire who are not physically "],[300.52,"capable of carrying you out of the fire "],[302.2,"is evidence of the crisis to deny people "],[305.28,"water nor to save a smelt evidence of "],[308.08,"the crisis to tear unborn children apart "],[311.24,"piece by piece and pull them out of a "],[312.8,"mother's womb and call it Health Care is "],[315.12,"an Evidence of the crisis the death and "],[318.36,"suffering caused by people believing in "],[320.8,"lies and foolishness has been a plague "],[323.24,"on This Nation the Liars have profited "],[326.44,"and they've been given presidential "],[328.24,"pardons before the investig ation could "],[330.24,"be started if you didn't commit any "],[332.08,"crimes why do you you need a preemptive "],[335.52,"pardon I'm very happy change is coming "],[338,"but let's not make sure we're cheering "],[341.24,"for "],[343,"Babylon so what could be the problem "],[345.84,"with Humanity exalting itself and the "],[348.52,"strong ruling the "],[350.68,"weak let me give you one Bible verse "],[353.48,"that you can use to build your as your "],[356.2,"like purpose statement for your life uh "],[359.36,"it put on your vision board could be "],[361.44,"your your Guiding Light a a litness test "],[364.68,"to determine if you and the people who "],[366.8,"are leading you are on the right "],[369.56,"path Micah chapter 6 ver8 he shown you "],[373.16,"old man what is good and what does the "],[376.12,"Lord require of you but to do justly to "],[381.04,"love mercy and to walk humbly with your "],[386.56,"God the problem that can arise from AER "],[389.6,"ocracy is the worship and exaltation of "],[392.4,"the winners the winners want the "],[395,"Adoration and people love to give it but "],[397.28,"it turns into idol worship it always has "],[399.52,"and it always "],[400.68,"will the best do not want to be the best "],[403.68,"just this year they want to be the best "],[406.16,"every year right Kevin you want to win "],[407.68,"the softball every year and then you "],[410.56,"want to be called the goat the greatest "],[413.68,"of all time and if we can be that then "],[418.92,"we soon fancy ourselves as a God because "],[423.72,"I'm in god mode funny how that "],[427.24,"expression is not part of our culture "],[429.52,"it's used so casually I'm able to get "],[431.8,"into my windows setting and control the "],[434.6,"program and when I'm in control of it "],[436.68,"I'm in I'm in god mode I'm invulnerable "],[440.28,"in this video game yeah bro I'm in god "],[443.04,"mode "],[445.12,"baby Nimrod was the first person to "],[448.68,"claim god mode all the kings of the "],[451.92,"ancient empires claimed God Mode God "],[454.84,"mode is the philosophy of Babylon and "],[457.48,"what's wrong with it is what has always "],[459.36,"been wrong with it that too is "],[462.08,"foolishness and lies because there is "],[464.76,"only one Creator God and when people "],[467.72,"exalt themselves and ignore him they lie "],[470.4,"to themselves and everyone else around "],[472.16,"them the breath in your lungs is God's "],[475.96,"the water the land and all in the what "],[478.72,"is in the world that's sustains Our "],[480.32,"Lives was created and provided to us by "],[484.48,"God we are to give thanks for these "],[487.32,"gifts and walk humbly before God showing "],[490.4,"Mercy to one another requiring Justice "],[493.6,"from each other and ever seeking to "],[495.96,"strike the balance between the two "],[498.16,"asking God for the wisdom to help us do "],[500.44,"justly and love mercy and that's how we "],[502.88,"walk humbly Babylon is described in "],[505.76,"Revelation and all who built it and all "],[507.96,"who support it are those who do do not "],[509.84,"believe there is a God who created them "],[512.36,"who is Sovereign over them instead they "],[514.4,"believe in the exaltation and the "],[515.88,"deification of mankind and this is the "],[518.48,"doctrine of demons this was the very "],[520.84,"first lie spoken by the serpent to Eve "],[524.16,"in the Garden of Eden eat of the tree of "],[526.6,"knowledge and good and evil and you will "],[528.24,"not die you will become like God knowing "],[532.52,"good from "],[533.52,"evil in one sense that's technically "],[537.04,"true God does know good from evil "],[540.12,"but the false advertising in that "],[542.2,"statement is eat of this and you will be "],[545.6,"like God that's the big bold marketing "],[550.12,"statement you know clearance 70% off big "],[556.08,"orange yellow letters and what's down "],[557.44,"here in the small print un selected "],[560.56,"items unselected "],[563.68,"items that means 70% off on two extra "],[568.64,"small "],[570.24,"shirts and three pairs of size 28 inch "],[575.28,"waist "],[576.92,"shorts right John Murdoch that's nothing "],[579.28,"you're going to buy you cannot that that "],[581.92,"is no 70% off for you "],[584.36,"buddy eat from the tree and you will be "],[587.36,"like God is what Eve heard what she "],[590.44,"didn't hear was you will be like him in "],[592.84,"one very technical aspect not in any way "],[596.72,"that's going to benefit you not in any "],[598.4,"way you assumed you'd be like God you're "],[600.52,"not going to be all knowing you're not "],[601.76,"going to be all powerful you're not "],[602.96,"going to be all the present you're not "],[603.92,"going to be immortal nevertheless the "],[607.4,"LIE is big bold and alluring that we can "],[611.44,"be like God there's a way to get into "],[616.04,"god mode that's what Babylon is a false "],[620.12,"religion spawn by those lies of demons "],[624.2,"verse number two elaborates on that for "],[626.48,"us a little bit where it says Babylon on "],[630.48,"the greatest Fallen is Fallen it's "],[632.56,"become the dwelling place of demons a "],[634.84,"prison for every foul Spirit a cage for "],[638.64,"every unclean and hateful "],[642.4,"bird what's that all "],[644.56,"about you know when you're uh driving "],[646.64,"down the road you see a bunch of "],[647.68,"vultures flocking to the side what does "],[649.36,"that mean what's going on there somebody "],[652.04,"hit a deer and it's sitting there "],[656.24,"rotting and the vultures are now "],[659.52,"feasting on the bloated carcass there's "],[662.4,"lots of lots of vultures and buzzards "],[664.08,"around here you ever notice that you "],[665.8,"know how come we how come we don't have "],[667.08,"a a hunting season for "],[669,"them why don't why don't we uh eat them "],[672.12,"for Thanksgiving yeah roast vulture "],[679.68,"yummy kind of makes you gag right and "],[682.12,"the reason is is because they're "],[683.8,"affiliated with Decay "],[687.36,"rot death the unclean Birds communicates "],[692.08,"that Babylon is rotten decaying place of "],[696.32,"death demons and death is what inhabits "],[700.32,"Babylon so this passage supports my "],[702.68,"belief that demons are literally "],[705.28,"attracted to certain activities and "],[707.24,"repelled by other activities activities "],[710.2,"like lying hatred greed murder "],[712.4,"fornication arrogance Rebellion "],[714.64,"drunkenness drugs the Greek word phakia "],[718.16,"where we get our English word Pharmacy "],[720.68,"is affiliated with "],[722.88,"witchcraft all these activities they "],[725.16,"attract those demons Paul said in 1 "],[727.84,"Corinthians chapter 10 rather than the "],[731,"things which the Gentiles sacrifice they "],[733.72,"sacrifice to demons and not to God I do "],[736.32,"not want you to have fellowship with "],[738.32,"demons you cannot drink the cup of the "],[740.44,"Lord and the cup of demons you cannot "],[742.12,"partake in the Lord's table and the "],[743.8,"table of demons meanwhile speaking the "],[747.08,"truth in love and praising the name of "],[748.84,"our great God and Savior Jesus Christ "],[750.8,"living a life of humble obedience seems "],[753.44,"to repel the demons Paul writes in 2 "],[755.88,"Corinthians for though we walk in the "],[757.44,"flesh we do not war according to the "],[759.4,"flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are "],[761.32,"not carnal But Mighty in God for pulling "],[764.6,"down strongholds casting down arguments "],[766.96,"in every High thing that exalts itself "],[768.8,"against the knowledge of God bringing "],[770.2,"every thought into captivity to The "],[772.16,"Obedience of Christ how do we make the "],[774.28,"devil flee from us James tells us in "],[776.48,"James chapter 4 he gives Grace therefore "],[779.36,"God resists the proud and gives grace to "],[781.44,"the humble submit to God resist the "],[784.64,"devil and he will flee from you draw "],[788,"nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you "],[791.08,"cleanse your hands you Sinners we put "],[793.92,"that on the hand sanitizer right there "],[796.12,"remember that was yeah I'm cruel I know "],[800.2,"purify your heart you double "],[802.4,"minded this must be done "],[805.32,"individually on the micro scale every "],[808.28,"individual must must put on the armor of "],[810.44,"God and stand against the attacks of the "],[812.16,"devil the Devil is a roaring lion who "],[813.56,"walks around seeking whom he may devour "],[815.8,"and we are in a spiritual battle every "],[817.4,"day whether we realize it or not "],[820,"Ephesians says we wrestle not against "],[821.84,"flesh and blood but principalities "],[824.08,"against Powers against rulers of "],[825.44,"Darkness of this world spiritual "],[826.84,"wickedness in high places we fight the "],[829.68,"spiritual battle on the micro level "],[831.64,"individually and when there is a group a "],[834.4,"family a Community Church community a "],[838.28,"nation that fights it on the macro scale "],[841.8,"that repels the devil and his influences "],[843.56,"away from us collectively and this is "],[846.88,"what Israel in the Old Testament was "],[849.12,"illustrating to us uh people obedient to "],[852.44,"God who were blessed protected and "],[854.8,"prospering because God's power and "],[856.52,"presence was with them the demons and "],[859.36,"their lies that lead to destruction were "],[861.68,"unable to come near with God's presence "],[864.68,"there but as people stopped calling on "],[866.52,"the name of the Lord and forgot about "],[868.56,"the laws of of God their sin attracted "],[872.16,"the demons and in Jesus day there was so "],[875.72,"many demon-possessed "],[878.16,"people but since uh Jesus came he we "],[882.2,"have been given the power over demons in "],[885.08,"his name and the gospel is the power of "],[888.4,"God unto salvation to everyone who "],[890.8,"believes we have been given the weapons "],[893.16,"to fight these spiritual battles but we "],[896.72,"have to fight them for whatever reason "],[900.2,"many people do not they have yielded as "],[905.2,"people have given up and are no longer "],[907.88,"resisting the temptation of sin demons "],[910.8,"are taking over it's so widespread even "],[914.32,"to the extent that churches and "],[916.52,"denominations are now completely under "],[918.56,"the sway of the Demons I mean you saw "],[921.88,"that this week right it was on full "],[923.28,"display for the nation and the world to "],[925.2,"see this past week at the inaugural "],[927.44,"prayer service hosted at the Washington "],[929.44,"National Cathedral where Reverend "],[931.4,"Maryanne Bud showcased the episcopalians "],[934.36,"denomination's Disobedience to and "],[936.56,"disregard for the word of God and Paul "],[939.84,"warned the church Beware of the wolves "],[942.72,"in sheep's clothing and based on their "],[945.12,"website if you've ever gone to it "],[947.6,"Reverend Maran and the entire "],[949.2,"Episcopalian denomination are in facts "],[951.68,"wolves in sheep's clothing they' broken "],[954.88,"rank they do not hold the line and the "],[957.76,"demons have taken over and many churches "],[960.16,"are promoting "],[962.76,"Babylon the message for us today here in "],[965.68,"Revelation 18 is verse four The Voice "],[969.68,"from Heaven saying come out of her my "],[973.36,"people come out of her lest you share in "],[977.28,"her sins and receive of her "],[981.56,"plagues we all individually must come "],[984.48,"out of Babylon put on the armor of God "],[986.88,"and fight the good fight of faith Faith "],[989.4,"so how does one come out of "],[992.52,"Babylon what are the specific sins that "],[995.2,"we need to repent of and turn away from "],[999.04,"what is Babylon being stressed here is "],[1002.76,"their sinful is their sin look at verse "],[1005.84,"number seven because he tells "],[1007.96,"us in the measure that she glorifies "],[1012.04,"herself and lives "],[1015.2,"luxurious in the same manner give her "],[1018.28,"torment and sorrow for she said in her "],[1020.88,"heart I sit as a queen and I am no Widow "],[1025.28,"and I will not seem "],[1027.04,"sorrow so those are the three sins "],[1029.96,"specifically that is being stressed here "],[1032.72,"what's the first "],[1034.24,"one glorifying self you know we've been "],[1037.12,"talking about this just like Nimrod the "],[1039.16,"false religion of Babylon is secular "],[1041.6,"humanism that man can obtain god mode "],[1046.64,"the second sin here is she's living "],[1049.76,"luxuriously now this Greek word here is "],[1052.84,"stazo it's a there's a good old English "],[1055.56,"word we don't use it so much anymore but "],[1057.12,"there's a good old English word that "],[1058.28,"really works for this it's the word "],[1060.04,"wanton everybody remember the word "],[1061.92,"wanton wanton is doing whatever you want "],[1066.24,"unrestrained unbridled passion often "],[1069.16,"used in the context of a sexually "],[1071.12,"unrestrained woman which fits well with "],[1073.32,"the description of this Harlot that's "],[1075.16,"called Babylon but look at the warnings "],[1077.92,"turn to J James chapter 5 I did not put "],[1080.72,"all of the passages into slides because "],[1083.88,"this is a longer one and I got lazy but "],[1085.72,"look at James chapter 5 uh the warning "],[1088.32,"that John that that James gives to those "],[1091.48,"who live in pleasure in luxury James "],[1094.08,"chapter 5 starting with verse number one "],[1096.68,"James says come now you "],[1099.04,"rich weep and howl for the miseries that "],[1102.92,"are coming upon you on the rich your "],[1106.76,"riches are corrupted and your garments "],[1108.8,"are moth eat and your gold and silver "],[1110.28,"are corroded and their corrosion will be "],[1112,"a witness against you and will eat your "],[1113.92,"flesh like fire you've heaped up up "],[1116.08,"Treasures in the last days indeed indeed "],[1118.96,"the wages of laborers mowed your fields "],[1121.2,"which you've kept back by fraud cry out "],[1123.32,"and the cries of the Reapers have "],[1124.76,"reached the ears of the Lord of hosts "],[1127.12,"you have lived on the earth in pleasure "],[1129.16,"and luxury you have fattened your heart "],[1131.96,"as in the day of Slaughter see how these "],[1136.12,"riches are a great danger to one "],[1139.48,"Souls says the your clothes are moth "],[1142.36,"eaten and your silver and your gold are "],[1144.4,"corroded and their corrosion is a "],[1146.4,"witness against you think about that for "],[1148.84,"a "],[1149.8,"minute when do clothes get moth eaten do "],[1155.2,"MTH just fly up on you and start noming "],[1158.64,"away on your on your hoodie while you're "],[1160.76,"wearing it like is that what happens is "],[1162.68,"that "],[1163.68,"how how does how do clothes get moth "],[1166.48,"eaten right when they're when they're in "],[1168.72,"storage remember back in the old days "],[1170.44,"where somebody uh would put mothballs "],[1173.16,"anybody put moth balls in their in their "],[1175.24,"okay and maybe in your coat jackets and "],[1177.68,"you put your your winter coats away in "],[1179.56,"storage and and you put M balls in your "],[1181.56,"mink coat right Jennifer you put in your "],[1183.32,"mink coat yeah keep it keep from them "],[1185.56,"moths from I know you girl I know it's "],[1187.86,"[Laughter] "],[1190.16,"you one of the reasons why gold and "],[1192.96,"silver are so valuable is because they "],[1194.64,"do not corrode but they can be known to "],[1197.44,"tarnish when stored often storage boxes "],[1200.64,"can contain organic sulfur compounds "],[1203.64,"which causes the metals to tarnish so "],[1206.2,"this storing up this stockpiling of "],[1209.4,"riches communicates "],[1211.76,"hoarding time and again we see Jesus "],[1214.96,"rebuking hoarding the wicked servant who "],[1218.32,"buried his money in the ground instead "],[1220.36,"of using it the rich man who had barns "],[1222.84,"full and he said what am I going to do I "],[1224.68,"know I'll tear my barns down and I'll "],[1226.44,"build bigger barns so I can just store "],[1228.8,"up even more I can hoard more wealth but "],[1231.72,"Jesus says lay up not up for yourselves "],[1233.64,"Treasures on Earth lay up Treasures in "],[1236.76,"Heaven you remember this story right "],[1239.28,"when when Sherry Shores saw the "],[1241.4,"earthquake that destroyed so much of "],[1243.04,"Haiti there a decade or two back and she "],[1246.08,"said to Michael I have this retirement "],[1248.52,"account that's come "],[1249.88,"due and I want to give it to this needy "],[1252.48,"church I've heard about and that gift "],[1255.6,"built Northwest Haiti Ministries it's "],[1259.28,"now a entire church and school Ministry "],[1263.56,"that feeds hundreds of children every "],[1267.32,"day it employs people in that community "],[1270.92,"and the gifts that come out of this "],[1272.48,"church support that Ministry it's "],[1275.04,"practically Jerry you can correct me if "],[1276.44,"I'm wrong but it's practically the "],[1277.72,"economic engine of that little Community "],[1279.32,"isn't it that ministry right there is "],[1281.4,"the economic engine of that little "],[1284,"community in "],[1285.92,"Haiti the gifts Fe eting educating and "],[1291.68,"most important of all sharing the gospel "],[1294.96,"a retirement fund imagine that instead "],[1298.6,"of collecting interest to make someone "],[1300.4,"else richer used to build the kingdom of "],[1304.12,"God and we're looking forward to hearing "],[1306.24,"from Pastor Mark and the team as they "],[1308,"travel to Josiah's house in the "],[1309.6,"Dominican Republic and then "],[1311.16,"faithbuilders is planning to go to "],[1312.6,"Kentucky to restore Poor People's homes "],[1314.88,"this "],[1315.96,"summer all these opportunities "],[1318.96,"to get in there and help people God "],[1321.36,"doesn't mind if you have nice things "],[1323.52,"God's very generous with us but we were "],[1326.56,"blessed to be a we're blessed to be a "],[1330.32,"blessing we're not blessed to hoard it "],[1332.48,"and consume it on our own "],[1336.8,"wealth I know it's like to be "],[1340,"poor one of the pitfalls of being poor "],[1343.8,"and then working out of it is the "],[1346.04,"tendency to cling to the money tightly "],[1349.52,"I don't want to go back to the struggle "],[1351.4,"and the more money I have that insulates "],[1354.12,"me from poverty but it's not the money "],[1357.2,"that lifted me up it's the "],[1360.68,"Lord "],[1362.32,"meritocracy makes one "],[1364.52,"conclusion I worked hard I earned this "],[1369.72,"me I pulled myself up it's my money I "],[1373.08,"can do with it what I see fits not "],[1375.16,"according to James chapter 5 where we "],[1378.12,"all have to give an account to God for "],[1380.24,"how we spend our money and how we use "],[1382.44,"our wealth and it will be counted "],[1384.32,"against you at "],[1386.12,"judgment if you only used it for your "],[1388.64,"own luxury and "],[1390.44,"self-indulgence that is the spirit of "],[1394.68,"Babylon self glor glorification "],[1398.48,"unbridled living unbridled luxuriously "],[1401.64,"and the third "],[1402.96,"one is found in these words did you "],[1406.84,"catch what it is "],[1409.36,"she says in her heart I sit as a queen I "],[1411.72,"am no Widow and I will not see sorrow "],[1414.4,"what is "],[1415.84,"that it's "],[1417.84,"Pride I'm a "],[1420.28,"queen all the kings put their Queens on "],[1422.96,"the floor we "],[1424.68,"will everybody's a queen nowadays e like "],[1427.36,"I mean that's just you slay Queen right "],[1429.04,"that's that's what's going on nowadays "],[1431.16,"everybody's a queen this passage here is "],[1433.88,"actually a reference to Isaiah chter 47 "],[1436.76,"turn to Isaiah chter 47 "],[1439.32,"verse number "],[1441.76,"5-9 listen to what the prophet says to "],[1446.8,"Babylon Isaiah 47 starting in verse "],[1449.4,"number five sit in silence and go into "],[1452.56,"darkness oh daughter of the calans who "],[1454.6,"are the calans "],[1456.8,"Babylonians for you will no longer be "],[1458.8,"called The Lady of Kingdoms I was angry "],[1461.04,"with my people I have profan my "],[1463.28,"inheritance and given them to your hand "],[1465.76,"you showed them no mercy on the elderly "],[1468.76,"you laid your yoke very "],[1470.88,"heavily and you said listen to what "],[1473.76,"Babylon said I shall be a lady forever "],[1476.64,"so that you did not take these things to "],[1478.96,"Heart nor remember the latter end of "],[1481.16,"them therefore hear this now you who are "],[1483.68,"given to Pleasures who dwell securely "],[1486.4,"who say in your heart listen to what "],[1488,"they say I am did you catch that who say "],[1491.84,"in their heart I am and there is no one "],[1494,"else like me I am that's the Old "],[1496.4,"Testament name for God they're saying "],[1499.96,"I'm God I'm in god mode and then they "],[1503.84,"say I shall not sit as a widow nor shall "],[1506.04,"I lose no shall I know the loss of "],[1509.04,"children but these two things shall come "],[1511.24,"upon you being a widow and losing "],[1513.6,"children they shall come upon you in "],[1515.88,"their fullness because of the multitude "],[1517.56,"of your sorceries the great abundance of "],[1519,"your enchantments so these are defiant "],[1522.56,"boast made here in Isaiah and then "],[1525.24,"reiterated in Revelation 18 I will never "],[1528.16,"be a widow and I will never know sorrow "],[1532.6,"I won't lose any children so when would "],[1535.04,"that "],[1535.96,"happen losing a husband losing children "],[1540.04,"well in the ancient times it was the men "],[1542.44,"the husbands the sons that went out to "],[1544.12,"war and a woman a wife who boasts I'll "],[1547.2,"never be a widow I'll never mourn the "],[1549.32,"loss of a child this means Babylon is "],[1551.68,"boasting I'm all "],[1553.6,"powerful I could never be defeated and "],[1556.44,"my armies and my men they're "],[1560.64,"indestructible pride comes before "],[1564.44,"destruction the hottie spirit before the "],[1566.68,"fall says Proverbs you know pride is "],[1569.96,"considered one of the worst "],[1571.64,"sins really worse worse than sexual "],[1575.92,"perversion worse than "],[1578.16,"murder "],[1580.24,"why because we're all Sinners we are all "],[1584.72,"in grave danger of the wrath of God now "],[1588,"God God is offering a way to save us "],[1591.16,"he's offering help the penalty we owe "],[1593.92,"for our sins is death which is why you "],[1596.56,"and I and everyone you know is going to "],[1598.08,"die one day we all die because of our "],[1600.68,"sin Paul says the wages of sin is death "],[1605.32,"but the gift of God is eternal life "],[1609.44,"through Jesus Christ Our Lord and Christ "],[1612.88,"died for our sins and if we repent of "],[1616.76,"them if we humble ourselves and we "],[1619.28,"confess our sins he will forgive us and "],[1621.88,"he will cleanse us and we will inherit "],[1625.16,"eternal life but Pride Keeps Us trapped "],[1628.28,"in our sins and on this path to judgment "],[1631.48,"because we say I'm not a "],[1634.12,"sinner why why would God punish me I'm a "],[1637.44,"good person and you might be very you "],[1639.96,"very well might be good at some things "],[1641.8,"you may be you know good at school or "],[1643.8,"you work hard and you've accomplished "],[1645.72,"something you know hey I'm good at "],[1646.8,"sports and I'm good at Art and I'm good "],[1648.28,"at music and I'm good at programming and "],[1650.56,"maybe you're good at your job and maybe "],[1652.08,"you've saved some money and you're a "],[1653.44,"good citizen and maybe you don't break "],[1654.76,"the law and you're nice to people and "],[1656.56,"you don't let and you you're not rude "],[1659.88,"look at all my good deeds how can you "],[1662.16,"say that I'm a sinner and I deserve "],[1665,"wrath well God says there's none "],[1667.96,"righteous no not "],[1670.56,"one God is the standard of righteousness "],[1675,"not you and if you think that you are "],[1678.32,"the standard of righteousness then you "],[1680.36,"are claiming god "],[1683.56,"mode do justly love Mercy walk "],[1688.36,"humbly pride is the spirit of Babylon it "],[1691.64,"is the lies the demons tell you that "],[1694.24,"you're good man you you don't need to "],[1696.04,"change anything you don't need a savior "],[1698.36,"there's nothing wrong with you and "],[1700.6,"that's what's so damning about Pride God "],[1703.6,"gives the "],[1705.24,"grace to the humble but the the proud "],[1709.72,"won't ever ask for it like Babylon "],[1713,"people refuse to admit their "],[1715.56,"sin so the three sins here self- "],[1719.28,"glorification luxurious living and "],[1722,"what's the third one Pride these are the "],[1724.8,"besetting sins of "],[1727,"Babylon is it not fair to say they are "],[1732.16,"observable prevalent characteristics of "],[1734.84,"our "],[1736.36,"society anyone "],[1739.64,"if America grows more rich and "],[1742.96,"successful and powerful and will we have "],[1746.32,"the personal discipline to remain just "],[1749.88,"merciful and humble or would the "],[1752.92,"physical riches only fuel the "],[1755.48,"self-gratification the carnal hedonistic "],[1758.24,"Lifestyles and the "],[1762.04,"arrogance how are we supposed to come "],[1764.16,"out of "],[1765.28,"this if we're citizens of "],[1768.8,"this country which seems so "],[1771.24,"Babylonian how do how do we he says come "],[1773.6,"out of it my people how how we don't "],[1775.68,"move to "],[1776.6,"Canada telling you right now I ain't "],[1779.8,"better "],[1782.4,"there well fortunately we have an "],[1785.12,"example found in scripture from one of "],[1788.48,"the people most responsible for building "],[1791.44,"Babylon he gives us the example of how "],[1794,"to live in it but come out of it turn to "],[1797.52,"Daniel chapter 4 and let me review with "],[1801.12,"you the testimony of King Nebuchadnezzar "],[1805.6,"did you know that a gentile King "],[1809.12,"actually is author of some of our "],[1813.56,"Bible this chapter is written by King "],[1817.72,"Nebuchadnezzar of the evil empire of "],[1820.96,"Babylon um for the sake of time I'm "],[1823.72,"going to summarize part of the chapter "],[1826,"so what's going on here is King "],[1827.2,"Nebuchadnezzar he has a dream and he is "],[1829,"shown an image of a great tree that "],[1831.48,"reaches to the heavens it fills the "],[1834.2,"Earth it's full of delicious fruits and "],[1837.72,"all the animals live under this tree and "],[1841.24,"live in the branches and it sustains "],[1844.6,"everyone but then picking it up at verse "],[1847.2,"number 13 what does it say "],[1850.36,"Nebuchadnezzar I saw in the vision in my "],[1853.12,"head while I was on my bed and a watcher "],[1855.64,"a holy one comes down from heaven and he "],[1857.44,"cried aloud saying chop down the tree "],[1861.16,"cut off its branches strip its leaves "],[1864,"and Scatter its fruit let the Beast get "],[1866.04,"out from under it and all the birds from "],[1867.4,"its branches nevertheless leave the "],[1869.88,"stump and the roots in the earth bound "],[1872.8,"with a band of iron and bronze in the "],[1875.6,"tender grass of the field let it be wet "],[1877.76,"with the Dew of Heaven now listen to "],[1879.84,"this watch the pronouns and let him gaze "],[1884,"with the beast on the grass of the field "],[1886.4,"and let his heart be changed from that "],[1888.96,"of a man and let him be given the heart "],[1892.08,"of a beast and let seven times which "],[1894.88,"would be seven years pass over "],[1897.52,"him this decision is the the decree of "],[1899.96,"the Watchers verse 17 sentenced by the "],[1902.48,"holy ones in order that the living may "],[1904.96,"know that the most high rules the "],[1907.36,"kingdom of men gives it to whom he will "],[1910,"sets over it the lowest of "],[1912.72,"men wow and then the Prophet Daniel "],[1916.4,"gives him the interpretation of this "],[1918.36,"dream verse number 20 Daniel says the "],[1921.36,"tree you saw which grew strong the "],[1923.4,"heights of Heaven could be seen by the "],[1925.4,"whole earth whose leaves were lovely and "],[1927.2,"the fruit abundant and there was all the "],[1929.72,"food for all and the beasts of the field "],[1932.28,"dwelt and the branches of the birds the "],[1933.68,"Kingdom of Heaven had home that's you oh "],[1936.64,"King "],[1937.84,"Nebuchadnezzar who have grown and become "],[1940.6,"strong for your greatness is groan and "],[1942.4,"reach the heavens and your Dominion to "],[1944.28,"the ends of the Earth in as much as the "],[1946.52,"king saw a watcher coming down from "],[1949.04,"heaven and saying chop the tree down and "],[1950.68,"destroy it but leave the stump and the "],[1952.16,"roots in the earth bound with a band of "],[1954.2,"iron and bronze in the tender grass of "],[1955.96,"the field let it be wet for the de of "],[1957.32,"heaven and let them gra graze with the "],[1959.24,"Beast of the field till seven times pass "],[1961.36,"over it this is the interpretation oh "],[1963.48,"King this is what's decreed by the most "],[1965.52,"high which comes upon my Lord the king "],[1968.52,"they shall drive you from men your "],[1971,"dwelling shall be with the beasts of the "],[1972.48,"field and they shall make you eat grass "],[1974.88,"like oxen they shall wet with the Dew of "],[1977.32,"Heaven seven "],[1979.28,"times shall pass over you till you know "],[1983.76,"the most high rules in the Kingdom of "],[1986.8,"men and gives it to whomever he "],[1989.52,"chooses so he says uh in as much as you "],[1992.76,"they gave the command to Le the stump "],[1994.84,"and the roots your kingdom shall "],[1996.8,"assuredly be assured to you after you "],[1999.72,"know that the heaven rules therefore oh "],[2002.72,"King let let my advice be acceptable to "],[2004.84,"you so then Daniel tells him here here's "],[2006.4,"what you should do based on the "],[2007.84,"information break off your sin by being "],[2009.84,"righteous in your iniquity by showing "],[2011.8,"Mercy to the poor so do justly love "],[2017.36,"mercy and humble perhaps there may be a "],[2020.84,"lengthening of your "],[2023.12,"prosperity and then it says here that uh "],[2026.6,"Nebuchadnezzar for 12 months think he "],[2028.52,"behaved himself it shook him up a little "],[2030.24,"bit but then look at verse number "],[2033.72,"28 at the end of the 12 months verse 29 "],[2037.8,"he was walking in his Royal Palace to "],[2039.44,"Babylon and the King spoke "],[2041.48,"saying is this not great Babylon that I "],[2046.28,"have built for a royal dwelling by my "],[2050,"mighty power and the honor of my majesty "],[2053.28,"and while the word was still in the "],[2054.56,"king's mouth a voice from Heaven King "],[2056.28,"Nebuchadnezzar to you it is spoken the "],[2058.92,"kingdom has departed from you and you "],[2061.32,"shall they shall drive you out from men "],[2063.8,"and your dwelling will be with the "],[2064.96,"beasts of the field and you shall make "],[2066.68,"you eat the grass like an oxen and seven "],[2069.64,"times will pass over to you until you "],[2072,"know that the most high rules in the "],[2074.84,"Kingdom of man and gives it to whoever "],[2076.68,"he "],[2078.36,"chooses that very hour was fulfilled "],[2080.8,"Nebuchadnezzar was driven out from men "],[2082.44,"and ate grass like an ox and his body "],[2084.96,"was wet with the Dew of the heavens till "],[2086.52,"his hair grew had grown like Eagle's "],[2088.64,"feathers and his nails like Bird's "],[2093.56,"Claws and at the end of the time neb I "],[2096.08,"Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to "],[2097.96,"Heaven my understanding returned to me "],[2100.76,"and I blessed the most high and praised "],[2103.28,"and honored him who lives forever for "],[2105.2,"his Dominion is an everlasting dominion "],[2107.96,"and his kingdom is from generation to "],[2109.96,"generation and all the inhabitants of "],[2111.76,"the Earth are reputed as nothing he does "],[2114.48,"according to his will in the armies of "],[2116.76,"heaven and among the inhabitants of the "],[2118.4,"earth and no one can restrain his hand "],[2120.6,"or say what have you done at the same "],[2123.36,"time my reason returned to me and for "],[2125.64,"the glory of my kingdom my honor my "],[2127.72,"Splendor returned to me my counselors "],[2129.92,"and Nobles restored me I was restored to "],[2133.04,"my kingdom with Excellence Majesty added "],[2135.68,"to me and now I "],[2138.12,"Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and "],[2140.76,"honor who the king of Heaven all of "],[2145.72,"whose works are true his ways are just "],[2148.96,"and those who walk in Pride he's able to "],[2151.88,"put "],[2153.52,"down do you understand what happened "],[2156.2,"here the king who built Babylon fully "],[2159.96,"embraced the self- glorification and the "],[2162.28,"pride that success and riches offer and "],[2165.6,"Nebuchadnezzar was in god "],[2168,"mode so God gave him a mental health "],[2171.52,"crisis and Nebuchadnezzar thought he was "],[2173.84,"a "],[2174.92,"cow how interesting because the same "],[2177.32,"thing happens today people think they're "],[2179.6,"cats and they think they're creatures "],[2181.12,"and Men identify as women and women "],[2183.48,"identify as men just like Nebuchadnezzar "],[2185.28,"the reason has left them and that's a "],[2187.96,"sign of "],[2189,"judgment and all this will continue "],[2192,"until "],[2193.24,"when until people will "],[2195.88,"say God is in control he is the maker of "],[2199.8,"heaven and Earth his ways are just he's "],[2203.28,"all "],[2204.2,"powerful this is how we can live in "],[2207.64,"Babylon but yet come out of it so we "],[2210.72,"don't share in our sins or receive her "],[2212.92,"plagues do "],[2215.08,"justly love Mercy "],[2218.36,"walk "],[2219.8,"humbly maybe somebody wants to start "],[2223.12,"walking humbly today let's bow in prayer "],[2226,"every head bowed and every eye closed "],[2227.68,"and if there's someone here today who's "],[2229.36,"never repented of their sins never "],[2232.8,"admitted I I am a sinner and I need "],[2235.88,"saving I need Jesus you just you just "],[2239.04,"pray it you just pray in your heart you "],[2240.92,"say dear Lord Jesus please forgive me "],[2243.36,"please forgive me I do not want to be "],[2246.44,"destroyed by "],[2248.4,"worshiping self and glorifying self and "],[2252.32,"just using all these riches to consume "],[2255.72,"upon myself Lord help me be broken of my "],[2260.12,"pride help me know that you are God that "],[2263.48,"you are Lord that you got plans and "],[2265.72,"purposes and help me to be "],[2268.76,"obedient Jesus died for your sins he "],[2272.16,"died to set you free it's offered

the"],["465.199","places or rooms or maybe condos within"],["467.68","the city have our names on them because"],["470.88","Jesus made them for us and when we were"],["473.199","added to the kingdom we talk about often"],["475.919","around here building the kingdom of God"],["477.759","how do we do that well when we say that"],["480.8","we mean reaching people with the with"],["484.319","the gospel

of God they become a child of God"],["504.4","and then they're part of the household"],["505.919","of God so then God Jesus prepares a room"],["509.759","a place for them i told you last week uh"],["513.599","when we bought our our new home in 2007"],["516.88","that was actually the second house we"],["518.32","ever bought the first house we ever"],["519.68","bought Illiana and I uh was

(Pastor Rob McNutt)","date":"2025-04-27","transcript":[["21.359","My first introduction into the world of"],["24.48","sports came when I was four years old."],["28.32","We had moved uh to Nebraska Bible"],["30.56","Institute. My dad bought a trailer and"],["32.64","we moved right into a trailer court and"],["35.6","it was late August and kids were outside"],["38.32","playing baseball. Also, I went out to"],["40.719","play and to make new friends. I'd never"],["43.68","played a sport before that. This was not"],["46.559","an adult supervised event. There was no"],["49.28","parents, no coaches around, just a bunch"],["51.84","of kids up in a cow field with a bat and"],["54.079","a ball. And four years old, I wandered"],["57.28","over there and I got incorporated into"],["59.52","the game. The big kids let me play. So,"],["62.8","as you can imagine, I was completely"],["64.799","lost what the point was to the game. And"],["68.24","so they had to teach me. This is how"],["69.28","they taught me how to play baseball. All"],["70.32","right, kid. Get over here. Get in line."],["72.56","Here's your You're in line here. And you"],["74.88","get a turn to go up to bat and you get"],["77.439","to take two"],["79.32","swings. And so I got up there and I"],["82.159","swung and I missed and I swung late and"],["85.119","the ball was already by. I was pitiful."],["88.08","I'm four, you know. So I'm four. And uh"],["90.56","so then the big kid Danny says, \"All"],["93.759","right, there you go. You're done. Now"],["95.759","I'll take your third swing for you.\" So"],["98.159","Danny gets the bat and he takes the"],["101.2","pitch and he cranks it into the outfield"],["103.119","and I got to run the bases. So Danny was"],["106.96","basically the MVP, the coach and the"],["108.72","umpire all rolled up in one. He was the"],["110.72","oldest kid in the yard with two younger"],["113.759","brothers. So it was his game. It was his"],["116","world. We were just living in it. So"],["118.96","sure enough, he hit into the outfield"],["120.479","and I got to run the bases. So I didn't"],["122.96","really know what I was doing."],["124.159","Nevertheless, I was out there playing"],["126.6","baseball. I kept going out in the yard"],["129.119","to play sports with the big kids. And as"],["131.12","I grew, I got to understand the games"],["133.52","better. I figured out the rules. And"],["136.239","then one day, I actually got up for my"],["138.52","two pitches. And lo and behold, I"],["141.92","actually hit one for myself and I got to"],["143.68","run the bases. Probably got out because"],["145.44","it was probably a little dribbler, but"],["146.8","whatever, you know. So, for me, that's"],["149.04","been my entire life. basically joining"],["151.04","into something that I have no clue what"],["153.04","I'm doing and just figuring it out on"],["154.959","the fly. See, back in the day, there was"],["157.04","no such thing as YouTube instructional"],["159.239","videos. And when you went into a new"],["161.519","situation, you were just expected to"],["163.36","look around at what everyone was doing"],["165.28","and jump in and do the same thing. Hey,"],["168.239","we're going to go out to work on the"],["170.56","farm, right, kid? get up in that hay mau"],["173.04","and that and we're going to throw bales"],["174.319","of hay at you and we want you to build"],["176","tears and just look at the pattern and"],["178.8","do it and uh you know happen make it"],["182.72","happen and so sure enough they just"],["184.48","start throwing bails ahead you got to"],["186.08","figure it out first time ever preached a"],["187.76","sermon I was candidating to be a youth"],["189.76","pastor at the people's church never"],["191.599","wrote a sermon never preached a day in"],["193.28","my life and I was auditioning for the"],["195.8","job so I was like okay well I guess I'll"],["198.56","just step up here and take my swing"],["200.56","preach a sermon"],["201.76","I was probably a mess, but they gave me"],["204.319","the job anyways. Not sure how that"],["205.92","worked out. This has been my life. I got"],["208.959","married. No clue what I was doing. Just"],["210.72","had to figure it out. Six weeks later,"],["213.36","says I'm pregnant. Okay, so now I got to"],["215.04","figure out being a husband and a dad."],["218.879","Now, the challenge with doing things"],["220.56","this way is"],["223.319","what? I struck out a lot. Made a lot of"],["227","mistakes. Not always sure what I'm"],["229.04","doing. trial and error, lots of failure,"],["231.92","uh a lot of doing it wrong, trying to"],["234.159","figure it out. But here's the concern."],["236.319","What What if I don't? What if I don't"],["239.36","figure it out? Some things are too"],["241.2","important to fail at how to be a good"],["244.239","husband. How to be a good dad wasn't"],["246.879","easy. Could have cost me a great deal to"],["249.92","have struck out on that. Some people"],["252.08","don't figure it out. Some people don't"],["253.28","figure out how to work with others, how"],["255.84","to cope with stress. Many people develop"],["258.32","some maladaptive coping mechanisms, some"],["260.959","bad habits that don't help. They end up"],["263.12","actually hurting themselves, maybe"],["264.8","ruining their lives. So, for a time,"],["267.919","that's exactly what was happening with"],["269.56","me. I jumped into a bunch of stuff and I"],["272.72","was trying to figure it out on my own,"],["274","college, relationships, life, future,"],["276.84","career, and I realized I'm just whiffing"],["280.639","away up here. Just strike it out all"],["282.72","over the place. I was fouryear-old me"],["285.199","all over again, playing the game of"],["287.12","life, swinging and missing. But the"],["290.08","difference this time"],["292.04","was it didn't have to be that way. I had"],["295.52","a lot of information available, but I"],["298.16","was just choosing to ignore it. Matter"],["300.32","of fact, I had someone who once again"],["303.84","would pinch hit for me, who would hit a"],["306.88","home run on my behalf. I just needed to"],["309.039","step back and let him take a swing."],["313.28","This isn't just me I'm talking about."],["315.759","This is all of us. There is distinct"],["319.96","information. There is special revelation"],["323.36","given to us that assures us blessings,"],["326.8","assures us success and prosperity,"],["330","health and happiness, privilege and"],["332.72","protection. If you listen carefully"],["334.8","today, I'm going to tell you what it is."],["338.68","Revelation chapter 22."],["342.32","the last chapter in the last book of the"],["346.24","Bible. And we're going to finish our"],["348.4","study in Revelation today. What a"],["350.88","miracle this will"],["353","be. But we're in verse number six."],["355.919","Revelation 22:6. Then he said to me,"],["358.56","this is an angel speaking to John. These"],["360.479","words are faithful and true. The Lord"],["362.16","God of the holy prophets sent his angel"],["364.639","to show his servant the things which"],["366.479","must shortly take place. Behold, I am"],["369.919","coming quickly. Blessed is he who keeps"],["371.84","the words of the prophecy of this book."],["374.479","Now I, John, saw and heard these things."],["377.84","And when I heard and saw, I fell down to"],["380.08","worship before the feet of the angel who"],["381.6","had showed me these things. Then he said"],["383.759","to me, \"See that you don't do that. For"],["385.919","I am your fellow servant, and your"],["387.919","brethren, the prophets, and of those who"],["390.639","keep the words of the book, worship"],["392.919","God.\" And he said to me, \"Do not seal up"],["396.16","the words of the prophecy of this book,"],["398","for the time is at hand. He who is"],["400.28","unjust, let him be unjust still. He who"],["402.96","is filthy, let him be filthy si still."],["405.44","He who is righteous, let him be"],["406.8","righteous still. He who is holy, let him"],["409.36","be holy still. Behold, I come quickly,"],["413.199","and my reward is with me to give to"],["415.6","everyone according to his work. I'm the"],["417.84","alpha and omega, the beginning and the"],["420.319","end, the first and the last. Blessed are"],["423.36","those who do his commands that they may"],["427.039","have the right to the tree of life and"],["429.28","may enter through the gates into the"],["431.199","city, but outside are the dogs and the"],["434","sorcerers, sexually immoral, the"],["435.52","murderers, the idolattors, and whoever"],["437.12","loves and practices a lie. I, Jesus,"],["440.479","have sent my angel to testify to you of"],["443.759","the things in the churches. I am the"],["446.08","root and the offspring of David, the"],["449.36","bright and morning star. And the spirit"],["451.84","and the bride say, \"Come.\" And let him"],["454.639","who hears say, \"Come.\" And let him who"],["457.52","thirst come. Whoever desires, let him"],["460.319","take the water of life freely. For I"],["462.96","testify to everyone who hears the word"],["465.12","of the prophecy of this book. If anyone"],["467.199","adds to these things, God will add to"],["469.12","him the plagues that are written in this"],["470.479","book. If anyone takes away from the"],["472.24","words of this book of this prophecy, God"],["474.72","shall take away his part in the book of"],["477.44","in the book of life from the holy city"],["479.68","and from the things which are written in"],["481.68","this book. He who testifies to these"],["484.8","things says surely I come quickly. Amen."],["489.039","Even so, come Lord Jesus. And then the"],["491.52","benediction, the grace of the Lord Jesus"],["493.199","Christ be with you all. Amen."],["498.4","John says in verse number eight, I John"],["500.8","saw and heard these things. So that the"],["503.28","question is what"],["506.039","things? Everything that we have studied"],["508.639","for the last year. We're right back"],["511.52","where we started. Revelation 1, the"],["514.959","first chapter, the revelation of Jesus"],["517.44","Christ that God gave him to show his"],["519.519","servants things which must shortly take"],["521.519","place. And he sent and signified it by"],["523.919","his angel to his servant John who bore"],["526.959","witness to the word of God to the"],["528.88","testimony of Jesus to all the things he"],["531.12","saw. Blessed is he who hear reads and"],["534.56","those who hear the words of this"],["536.24","prophecy and keep those things which are"],["538.959","written in it for the time is near. The"],["542.959","message to the seven"],["545.56","churches, these things, the scene at the"],["549.68","throne room, the"],["552.12","seven seal judgments, the seven"],["554.8","trumpets, the various entities that we"],["557.6","saw, the two witnesses, the 144,000"],["560","sealed, the the beast, the dragon, the"],["562.32","false prophet, the harlot riding the"],["564.24","beast, the seven final bull judgments,"],["566.72","the return of Jesus, the battle of"],["568.88","Armageddon, the millennial kingdom, the"],["570.8","great white throne judgment, the new"],["572.72","heaven and the new earth. These are the"],["574.959","things that John has seen and heard. The"],["579.44","point of studying the whole book is to"],["582.64","learn all the details to know and"],["585.2","understand the information but"],["588.12","also to gain the blessing spoken of at"],["591.839","the beginning of the book. Revelation"],["594.279","1:3, blessed is he who reads and who"],["597.279","hears the words of the prophecy and"],["599.279","keeps the things that are written. And"],["601.519","then again at the end of the book, the"],["603.68","last chapter, blessed is he, chapter"],["606.6","22:7, blessed is he who keeps the words"],["608.88","of the prophecy, reads the words of the"],["611.12","prophecy and keeps them. Chapter"],["613.16","1. Chapter 22, same thing. And then"],["617.2","again in chapter 22:12, he says, \"I come"],["620.16","quickly and my reward is with me to give"],["622.959","to those according to their works.\" And"],["625.04","again chapter 22:14, blessed are those"],["628.16","who do his commandments that they have"],["630.16","the right to the tree of life and may"],["632.079","enter through the gate to the city. So I"],["634.079","think ch verse 14 clears up any"],["636.48","confusion as to what John means by"],["638.72","keeping the words. He says"],["642.6","who do blessed is he who does the"],["647.88","commandments. That's the challenging"],["649.959","part. The doing. The doing, obeying is"],["653.44","the proof that you believe the word."],["655.6","When God gives commands, instructions,"],["658.32","directives, how we respond is the"],["661.2","evidence, is the proof that we really do"],["663.92","believe him. I found out the hard way"],["666.64","that not keeping, not doing the"],["668.64","commandments just resulted in me"],["671.12","striking out in life. Then I determined,"],["674.48","let's actually, I don't try doing, try"],["678.56","keeping the commandments. Let's see what"],["680.24","happens if I actually do things God's"],["682.8","way. If I exercise just a modicum of"],["685.24","discipline, make an effort, put into"],["688","practice all this stuff that I was"],["690.36","taught. So I started implementing the"],["694.959","main things I implemented"],["698.2","prayer, regular church attendance,"],["701.36","giving a percentage of my earnings from"],["703.04","Red"],["704.279","Lobster. worked at Red Lobster, took my"],["707.519","ties, gave it to Gave it to God, serving"],["711.56","others, and then the hardest of"],["714.92","all, practicing"],["717.88","self-discipline,"],["719.64","self-control. All the things I was"],["721.519","instructed to do for my formative years,"],["723.279","all the things I resisted doing, I"],["725.12","repented of my disobedience, rebellious"],["727.12","attitudes, and I said, \"God, I'll do"],["728.639","things your way, and let's see what"],["730.639","happens.\" What happened was my life"],["733.6","changed for the better in everything I"],["736.959","was involved in. I earned the best"],["739.04","grades I'd ever earned in my life. I had"],["742.32","the most impactful soccer season,"],["745.2","finished my college sports days, winning"],["748.12","awards. I made the best money at Red"],["751.16","Lobster and paid my school bill. And I"],["754.16","had enough money left over, which came"],["756.16","in real handy because I started dating"],["757.68","this young lady. And apparently I had"],["759.44","illustrated enough maturity that she"],["760.72","took me serious enough to eventually"],["762","marry"],["763.16","me. What a blessing. Maybe not for her,"],["766.24","but for me it was a"],["768.76","blessing. So what I experienced was an"],["772.48","amazing turnaround. It was so obvious. I"],["774.959","could not deny it. Keeping God's word"],["778.079","brought me lifechanging blessings. Now"],["780.959","I'd heard that my whole life, but I"],["783.04","never actually put it into"],["785.399","practice. Committing my way to the Lord."],["787.92","Proverbs 3:5 and 6 says, you know this"],["791.44","one, trust in the Lord with all your"],["794.48","heart. Lean not on your own"],["796.16","understandings. In all your ways"],["798.079","acknowledge them, and he will make he"],["800","will direct your"],["801.399","paths. Do not be wise in your own eyes."],["804.639","Fear the Lord. Depart from evil. It'll"],["806.959","be health to your flesh, strength to"],["809.76","your bones. Honor the Lord with your"],["812.079","your possessions and with the first"],["813.519","fruits of your increase so that your"],["816.079","barns will be filled with plenty and"],["817.92","your vats will overflow with new wine. I"],["820.639","knew those verses. I memorized them in a"],["822.48","wana, but I wasn't keeping them. But"],["824.8","once I did, my life"],["827.32","changed. Now, there are and there have"],["830","been times along the way in areas of my"],["832.079","life I deviated from keeping God's word."],["835.279","Disobedience and sin I got involved in"],["838.88","and I paid for it. The pain and the near"],["842.68","destruction I almost experienced serve"],["845.6","to remind me the blessings are there for"],["847.839","those who keep the words of life. But"],["850.639","the pain and destruction is also waiting"],["853.279","if I choose to rebel. On the one hand,"],["856.72","the blessings motivate me to trust in"],["858.8","the Lord. On the other hand, the peer"],["860.959","the the pain and the fear of failure"],["862.88","provokes me to obey. I've experienced"],["866.76","both. I know which one I prefer. I've"],["870.079","had plenty of experience with failure"],["871.6","and rejection, being poor and weak,"],["874","being in a place of despair and"],["875.6","confusion. I've stood at the plate with"],["877.839","two strikes and came to the realization"],["880.399","I got no chance of hitting this ball. I"],["882.88","can't do this on my own. But God said,"],["885.04","if you let me, I'll I'll pinch it for"],["888.079","you. and let me take your last"],["891.399","swing.

This past Thursday, we had a"],["939.76","special congregational meeting that I"],["942.16","wanted to share with you all because"],["944.24","only 50 people showed up for the"],["945.839","congregational meeting, which means a"],["947.12","lot of you didn't find out what was"],["948.56","going on. So, we gave a financial"],["950.32","report. Uh, so far in 2025, we have put"],["956.6","$200,000 back into our emergency uh"],["959.839","savings fund, special account sitting"],["962.16","there.
