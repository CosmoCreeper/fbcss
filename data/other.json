other Ministries why specifically are "],["1047.919","people pouring that out on this church "],["1049.679","well I think it's because we as a church "],["1052.52","are generous at redistributing "],["1055.72","it we had a request come to us from one "],["1058.96","of our missionaries that we support and "],["1062.039","they had this big project they asked for "],["1064.44","a gift at the end of the year over and "],["1065.88","above they said Can Can we can you guys "],["1068.679","help "],["1069.6","us how much is this "],["1072.72","$25,000 so well take that to the elders "],["1076.039","to the elders and uh we sat around "],["1078.52","talked about it and the elders decided "],["1082.4","God has been too generous with us to not "],["1085.32","give back that's the second time this "],["1087.72","year we've done that given a $25,000 "],["1090.12","gift to missionaries things outside of "],["1092.679","this church and those gifts are over and "],["1095.039","above what's budgeted the 110,000 "],["1097.76","120,000 that is budgeted in for next "],["1101.159","year when we announced that Keith and "],["1103.28","Judy were collecting

"],["86.34","to the gospel and anyone who claimed to "],["88.74","believe in Jesus would routinely be "],["90.72","rounded up and imprisoned or killed "],["92.46","missionaries would often come to

ought to pray for them "],["122.82","I didn't know any Chinese people or "],["125.759","missionaries but of all the missionary "],["128.88","cards in the Box I remember that one for

"],["151.739","wayside and even the box of prayer cards "],["155.04","eventually disappeared by Junior High "],["158.04","there was no longer a thing and I never "],["160.68","thought any more about

"],["174.54","keynote speaker was this Chinese man who "],["177.78","had been a missionary and planted "],["179.519","churches all over China and he was "],["182.04","telling all the stories of persecution "],["184.5","and trials and arrests and near-death "],["187.56","experiences but he also told us about "],["189.9","the explosive growth of the underground "],["192.36","church and despite all the persecution "],["194.819","and death the number of Christians in "],["196.98","China was innumerable "],["199.319","and at that conference the Holy Spirit "],["201.659","prompted my memory and

"],["214.319","generically for the church in China "],["217.86","it was exactly the time that that man "],["220.44","was on the mission field and all the "],["223.14","amazing work of the holy spirit

"],["233.7","and the Holy Spirit told me at that "],["235.26","conference this is who you are praying "],["237.72","for Rob "],["239.099","it was an aha moments for my faith and "],["243.299","understanding of the power of God and "],["246.36","the working of Prayer "],["248.94","you realize our God who we pray to is "],["253.22","transcended "],["254.9","omnipresent and

even try to "],["270.84","imagine it but in that conference I got "],["272.88","just a brief glimpse of how connected "],["275.28","things are things spoken of in one side "],["278.34","of the world

rusted I "],["43.19","learned to ride it and I was very happy "],["46.05","to ride it around with the big kids "],["47.879","because little kids had tricycles that "],["50.64","were slow and lame and you couldn't go "],["53.19","anyplace big kids rode bicycles and when "],["56.19","you had a bike you could go anywheres we "],["59.13","lived in the town of Truro Nova Scotia "],["60.66","my sister and I would ride our bikes a "],["63.57","couple of blocks to swimming lessons and "],["65.7","we would take the rider down to the "],["67.5","store and get a treat and when you had a "],["69.72","bike you had freedom was proof that you "],["72.54","were all grown up now you could take "],["74.19","care of yourself because you when she "],["76.229","went on a ride parrots kinda had to let "],["77.58","you go they didn't really know where you "],["78.57","were you were just riding all around the "],["80.009","community somewheres on your bike "],["81.96","so I never really thought too much about "],["84.57","the fact that my bike was a hand-me-down "],["86.64","girl's bike because if it wasn't for "],["88.71","that hand-me-down bike I wouldn't have "],["90.15","had any bike at all I did remember that "],["93.51","dad gave it a facelift he got a can of "],["95.159","black spray paint and he sprayed the "],["97.38","frame and was like oh I was like a "],["98.52","brand-new bike now Wow "],["100.14","I was good my grandmother had a neighbor "],["103.17","whose son was a year older than me and "],["105.869","once a year I would receive a couple of "],["107.58","bags of clothes that the kid had grown "],["111.18","out of and gave my grandmother and she "],["112.92","gave it to me and I remember being "],["114.689","always it's so excited to see what new "],["117.54","clothes I had got didn't really care "],["120.39","that they were hand-me-downs they were "],["122.34","new to me and I remember very "],["124.59","specifically one time this was when the "],["128.94","loire shirts and corduroys were in I "],["131.75","remember some of you don't have any clue "],["134.13","what a velour shirt is and some of you "],["135.6","were laughing because you're visualizing "],["137.459","me in a wide colorful or certain with "],["139.44","corduroys on right and that was good "],["141.51","because there was a whole bunch in that "],["142.89","bag and that was really cool so "],["147.37","some point as a kid I figured out that "],["149.62","we did not have a lot to work with I "],["152.92","didn't have a clue how much my dad "],["155.17","officially earned but it wasn't too "],["157.959","tough to figure out that it wasn't a "],["159.19","whole lot sometimes I was frustrated "],["161.47","when I knew I was gonna be told no we "],["163.9","can't afford that but all of my needs "],["166.269","were met and I was having a lot of fun "],["168.67","ride around on my little bicycle where "],["171.099","my corduroys so you know I wasn't too "],["174.25","vexed by what we didn't have looking "],["176.349","back and talking to my father and he "],["178","would explain to me now you know what "],["179.95","they were being paid and I think Wow not "],["182.319","a bit of wonder we lived the way we did "],["184.18","because we were poor but it doesn't make "],["187.69","me feel shame actually it kind of gives "],["190.15","me a sense of pride when I think of my "],["193.39","upbringing and I think of my stories one "],["195.7","day Ilyana was telling the boys stories "],["198.97","about when she was a little girl and "],["200.519","Eliana's mom has four sisters and since "],["203.47","she was the oldest and only "],["205.09","granddaughter she was you know the "],["209.049","chosen one she was the little dolly that "],["212.26","they all spoiled and they would buy her "],["215.709","clothes and she got the the newest trans "],["218.62","living in New York City having all the "],["220.72","latest fashions these these young "],["222.72","20-something women would buy her and "],["225.19","dress her up and she looked really cool "],["228.04","and then juxtaposed to her telling her "],["230.44","story about that I told the boys when I "],["233.92","was a little guy my favorite shirt was a "],["236.799","t-shirt that said tough stuff "],["239.109","and I loved to wear it because it made "],["241.329","me feel tough and I would wear it every "],["244.389","day and I would wear it with my shorts "],["246.91","and my rubber boots and I would go "],["249.4","outside and play every day in my tough "],["252.13","stuffed shirt in my rubber boots and "],["255.75","boys would look at me and they look at "],["260.2","their mother and then they just start "],["262.33","laughing hysterically at the picture "],["265.24","that we just drew in our two stories "],["268.24","here's this trendy city girl looking too "],["270.82","cute and then right beside that is this "],["273.46","little dirty ragamuffin boy with his "],["276.46","belly popping out of his too small pammi "],["279.969","down tough stuff sir "],["281.26","his rubber boots and it's comical but I "],["283.81","always tell my stories not with the "],["286.15","sense of embarrassment but rather with a "],["287.65","sense of pride I'm proud of where I come "],["290.8","from I grew up poor "],["292.78","I didn't always like it but it did "],["294.97","instill in me a sense of appreciation "],["297.31","and gratitude there's this prophecy in "],["301.15","2nd Timothy chapter 3 and you all just "],["304.12","said oh well the new book we're studying "],["306.4","is 2nd Timothy no this is a topical "],["309.25","sermon I have not decided where we're "],["311.56","going next I have an idea but I know "],["313.99","it's crazy pastor Robb never does "],["315.4","topical but today we're doing topical "],["317.86","for Thanksgiving but here's a vivid "],["320.44","description in 2nd Timothy chapter 3 "],["323.16","verse number 1 and you many you know "],["325.87","this passage because I've quoted it many "],["327.34","times before Paul says but realize this "],["329.83","in the last days difficult times will "],["332.71","come for men will be lovers of self "],["335.14","lovers of money boastful arrogant "],["337.57","revilers disobedient to parents

negative "],["364.38","description that's negative right so "],["367.81","doesn't sound like people are getting "],["369.61","better or advancing it doesn't sound "],["372.1","like and improving or superior culture "],["375.19","does it now sounds like society is going "],["377.71","to be degrading and I don't want to "],["380.62","cover all of it today I just want to "],["382.6","zoom in on one specific description they "],["387.1","will be ungrateful coming into the "],["391.57","Thanksgiving season I thought it would "],["393.37","be good for us to talk about "],["394.8","thankfulness and what it is and what "],["397.93","it's not and before I forget I just "],["400.06","wanted to report to the church that we "],["401.71","had over 243 shoeboxes delivered that is "],["406.42","twice as much as we did last year and "],["408.67","krystal thrown the gauntlet down to say "],["410.59","we can do more Church and well there you "],["412.45","go crystal well done "],["413.92","Faith Bible Church "],["415.72","so I want to talk about what "],["418.34","Thanksgiving is and what it is not the "],["420.92","opposite of being thankful is I'm "],["422.81","grateful "],["423.62","thankless unappreciative ungracious who "],["426.32","typically do we visualize when we think "],["428.24","of ungrateful people why are we thinking "],["431.57","of we think of rich kids right right "],["432.95","rich kids because they have a lot and "],["434.81","and the rich kid doesn't have to accept "],["436.76","the hand-me-down used bicycle or the "],["438.83","used clothes because he gets the new "],["440.9","stop the best stop he's got so much he "],["443.39","doesn't understand the value of anything "],["445.1","if you have only one pair of shoes "],["446.93","you're quite upset if you get them "],["448.67","wrecked or dirty but you tend to take "],["452.09","care of it if that's all you have but if "],["453.74","you have a bunch it doesn't matter if "],["455.24","you lose a wreck something because you "],["457.22","got plenty rich people are ungrateful "],["458.72","and poor people are so much more "],["460.46","grateful or so we assume but you know I "],["463.4","have met a lot of poor people who are "],["466.28","very ungrateful as well I've seen some "],["469.16","of the poorest people homeless people "],["470.51","complain about a free breakfast that you "],["472.82","made them and I like this breakfast why "],["474.62","can't we have this and I've seen people "],["476.84","go to care net to get free diapers and "],["479.18","then complain that that wasn't the brand "],["480.83","that they wanted this brand does not "],["482.84","satisfy them so I've seen poor people "],["485.83","receive new coats and boots for winter "],["489.14","and then just completely trash them "],["490.76","within two weeks likewise I've heard "],["493.22","people who have a great deal of "],["494.45","abundance say I'm so grateful and I'm so "],["496.82","thankful I've seen well-off people happy "],["499.04","to get a used item at a yard sale or "],["501.83","find something at a thrift store and be "],["504.08","so very pleased that they found this "],["505.49","great bargain so it's not accurate to "],["508.7","say people with abundance are ungrateful "],["511.01","and people would need our grateful "],["512.63","thankfulness is not a byproduct

about ladies in the "],["577.31","nursery right that would be a great "],["579.29","education on what human nature is "],["581.15","actually like you got a little dolly and "],["584.09","she's got her

"],["620.27","human nature is like there's an attitude "],["622.31","called "],["623.03","greed lust Envy and they're present in "],["627.53","the life of all rich or poor was it my "],["632.87","poor

"],["644.15","fact it is a choice that we have to make "],["647.39","to be thankful leviticus 22 in the law "],["649.76","when you offer a sacrifice of "],["651.8","Thanksgiving to the Lord

risk information and early "],["85.95","warning messages must be delivered that "],["87.78","makes sense and then response capability "],["90.21","systems should be in place to respond to "],["93.06","events I think we would all agree that "],["95.429","an early warning system is a good idea "],["98.99","something that can warn us is going to "],["102.24","help us avoid disaster and

Judah in Jeremiah chapter 43 "],["158.39","had the greatest early warning system of "],["161.3","all they had a prophet telling them "],["163.4","exactly what was going to happen what "],["166.61","was coming up in the future "],["168.2","they had risk knowledge they had a "],["171.77","warning system jeremiah acted as a means "],["174.8","of communication when he delivered the "],["176.75","warning to the leadership of the people "],["178.34","but here's where the system would break "],["180.23","down in step number four response "],["182.71","capability the challenge with the early "],["185.81","warning system is will people respond "],["188.54","appropriately based on the risk warning "],["192.35","and the dissemination of the message "],["193.79","what would the response be the other day "],["197.54","we were cooking something in the smoke "],["199.73","detector went off and my response to "],["201.92","that was to get a chair get up on it and "],["205.19","push the reset button right that was my "],["208.01","response to the warning and we were "],["210.2","sitting there a couple weeks back and we "],["212.81","got all sudden this beeping on our "],["214.31","phones and we looked at our phones and "],["215.6","it was a early warning system talking "],["217.43","about tornado you know high risk of "],["219.44","tornados coming through the area and to "],["221.78","which we went and shrugged her shoulders "],["223.73","and went back to watching our program so "],["227.45","our response was to shut it off and "],["229.459","ignore it now to our defense we knew the "],["232.91","house wasn't burning down a it was just "],["235.31","the chicken was getting a little bit "],["237.19","Cajun a little bit extra crispy there "],["240.23","and we you know pertaining to the "],["243.68","tornado what ought you do when a tornado "],["245.45","is coming stay home right stay inside so "],["248.42","we were already there I feel like we "],["250.28","responded appropriately if the house was "],["252.709","actually on fire and our response was to "],["255.41","turn the smoke detector off that would "],["257.269","be foolish and if we said you know hey "],["259.43","let's drive around and find the tornado "],["260.78","take pictures of it let's be tornado "],["262.55","hunters like that would be you know "],["264.8","dangerous and crazy so let's see what "],["267.59","the folks respond to the prophetic early "],["270.29","warning system here "],["272.18","in Jeremiah 43 and we're going to pick "],["274.85","it up in verse number 8 and then we're "],["276.38","gonna jump down a little bit into 44 "],["278.09","this morning but verse number 8 of "],["279.8","Jeremiah 43 says the word of the

at the entrance of "],["295.069","Pharaoh's Palace into Fannie's in the "],["297.589","sight of some of the Jews and say to "],["300.319","them thus says the Lord of hosts the God "],["302.209","of

"],["312.589","have hidden and he will spread his "],["314.779","canopy over them and he will also come "],["317.689","and strike the land of Egypt "],["319.309","those who are meant for death will be "],["321.11","given over to death and those for "],["322.819","captivity and those for the sword to the "],["325.369","sword and it shall be and I shall set "],["327.889","fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt "],["330.739","and he will burn them and take them "],["333.229","captive so he will wrap himself with the "],["336.259","land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps "],["338.839","himself with his garments and he will "],["340.729","depart from there safely "],["342.889","he will also shatter the awe bliss of "],["345.499","the Heliopolis which is in the land of "],["347.719","Egypt and the temples of the God of "],["350.479","Egypt he will burn with fire okay so "],["353.779","there's the warning the prophecy set "],["356.449","some stones you ever notice the Old "],["359.149","Testament Israel's always setting up "],["360.529","some stones why do they do that they set "],["364.639","them up to remember right as a "],["367.129","remembrance stones tend to stand the "],["370.669","test of time don't they use up some "],["372.529","stones they tend to be there for a long "],["374.479","time to come so much so the concept is "],["377.089","an expression that we use set in stone "],["381.739","right but policy set in stone "],["384.319","it means it's never going to change the "],["386.419","set in paper paper you know you can "],["388.909","shred it pretty easily would you can "],["391.219","light on fire you know metal does better "],["394.479","can last while you know things that "],["396.829","happen to metal here's a little inside "],["399.019","joke for you all from the McNab "],["401.179","household back in 2016 Tony totaled my "],["404.989","truck by skidding out in the rain and "],["407.209","hitting a traffic light pole on the "],["409.549","corner of Chancellor's running pay "],["411.019","growth still a little salty about it but "],["413.36","you know in doing so the truck bent a "],["417.139","metal access panel cover on the "],["420.19","whole to its side that open panel is our "],["424.99","memorial of that accidents and since "],["427.42","then we've been keeping our eye on it to "],["429.43","see how long that panel is gonna stay "],["431.17","been open so we're going on three years "],["433.57","now so you know not saying anything "],["436.15","about the county but it's last time we "],["438.25","checked it's still been open and there's "],["441.97","a country song that says we left our "],["443.83","mark on this town it's left our mark on "],["445.84","us and that's Tony's memorial that's his "],["448.81","mark that he left on peg wrote we we "],["452.08","think of it every time we see it bent "],["454.09","that Bank cover open metal last right "],["457.09","but eventually metal will even rust but "],["459.88","stone stone has staying power so all the "],["464.2","Jews in Egypt they see Jeremiah setting "],["466.93","up these stones and every time they go "],["469.87","by that Terrace and they look at those "],["471.43","stones they remember that prophecy and "],["474.01","if and when Nebuchadnezzar shows up and "],["477.1","sets up his throne there there will be "],["478.9","no denying the fact the message from God "],["481.93","where they were warned it was set in "],["485.08","stone no that's very interesting what if "],["488.29","it happen who knows there's a "],["493.39","inscription on a clay cylinder on "],["495.61","display in the British Museum with the "],["498.22","assigned museum number three three zero "],["500.05","four one

all of their "],["544.96","records all of their whatever they "],["547.18","wanted to save and then they would put "],["549.01","the clay tablets in the hot Sun and they "],["551.68","would break bake and then the "],["553.69","information "],["554.29","would then be set in stone and never "],["558.639","good Nezzer had posted his name in brick "],["561.459","all over that ancient city of Babylon

the Bible but a lot of "],["597.549","science proves that the Bible is very "],["600.189","accurate archeology is a science events "],["604.869","stated in Scripture that had been "],["607.209","written in stone and discovered by "],["609.069","scientists over and over again prove the "],["612.759","Bible to be true so the prophecy of "],["615.369","Jeremiah the warning he gave

"],["635.499","places we see that at the beginning of "],["637.809","chapter 44 where it lists the the Jews "],["640.569","in the land of Egypt and then even lists "],["642.369","the cities of McDole and Tiffany's "],["644.769","Memphis and Path Ross and often we read "],["648.16","these stories we need to take the time "],["649.629","to dig out a an atlas a Bible Atlas and "],["652.929","go through the maps and find out where "],["655.48","these places are located and often "],["657.579","you'll find that they're still there "],["658.629","today or when we study people's names we "],["661.48","should take some time to dig into who "],["662.98","these people were in history because "],["665.079","these names of people and places "],["668.309","likewise prove the biblical accounts are "],["671.139","accurate historical facts often when I'm "],["675.609","telling you stories about where I grew "],["677.949","up "],["678.159","I will even tell you about the names of "],["680.499","places and the names of people that I "],["683.139","grew up with and probably most of you "],["684.939","are never going to venture up the 95 all "],["688.089","way to Houlton Maine and cross over into "],["689.92","Carlton County New Brunswick and travel "],["692.019","up the st.

talk "],["707.829","about what year it was or what season it "],["709.839","was and all of these stories all of this "],["712.99","brings the story to life in your mind "],["715.6","and if you really were so motivated you "],["717.939","could just fact check it all couldn't "],["719.62","you you can get out your phone and go to "],["720.999","Google Maps and say let's follow the 95 "],["722.8","I know look it really does go all the "],["724.36","way up to the Canadian border and look "],["726.22","those names of those little towns are "],["727.569","right there here on my map in my hand "],["730.329","and it speaks to the authenticity if I "],["735.069","told you I was from Narnia or "],["738.85","Gondor or never Neverland you'd be "],["742.839","skeptical about any other detail I told "],["745.24","you about my upbringing wouldn't be like "],["747.279","oh well he knew orcs what what's wrong "],["749.199","with you see the accuracy on the facts "],["752.11","is evidence - the authenticity of the "],["754.48","message the accuracy of the facts is "],["758.079","evidence - the authenticity of the "],["760.12","message historical records of Jerusalem "],["762.839","falling right history records that that "],["765.79","that happened around 590 BC and then "],["768.309","these recordings of Egypt being "],["770.499","conquered by Nebuchadnezzar they're "],["772.12","written in the annals of history and all "],["774.1","these things that Jeremiah the Prophet "],["775.54","foretold would happen before they "],["778.149","happened all these things were warned - "],["782.019","the people were warned about as an "],["783.879","emergency warning system Jeremiah is "],["787.139","impeccably accurate see I'm belaboring "],["790.899","this point because it has an essential "],["793.269","application for all of us the fact that "],["795.999","the Bible prophecies given in advance of "],["798.639","the events are proven to be historic "],["801.329","story accurate ought to strengthen our "],["804.699","faith when you understand that that "],["807.55","these events we're told before they "],["810.37","happen and they've been proven

"],["1540.27","they just ignored and rejected God's "],["1543.12","revelations so it comes as no surprise "],["1546.36","to see people in our time embracing the "],["1549.24","darkness and calling the

"],["104.8","turn over there we'll get in the story "],["106.09","in a minute now remember that at this "],["108.19","time in history David is king by divine "],["111.97","decree the prophet Samuel

"],["182.53","gonna seem very shocking and harsh to us "],["185.2","this morning but people forget that "],["187.48","where our laws came from what produced "],["190.15","our rights and freedoms and how we got "],["191.95","to where we are today it all stems out "],["194.59","of things that happen way back then so "],["197.08","in our system we get to disagree with "],["199.239","our leadership and we can politic for a "],["200.86","leader we want and that would be okay "],["202.39","however the lies in the hatred that our "],["205.54","system manufactures I would say that "],["207.55","that

that's a little "],["281.2","background as we get into a second "],["282.88","samuel chapter xxi action we're going to "],["285.55","see here is some rebellion verse number "],["288.31","one a

"],["364.71","it was the military men from the other "],["366.599","tribes but Judah David's home tribe "],["369.36","remains loyal and that's part of the "],["371.46","dynamic within the nation the

Ryan and Randy showed "],["46.7","up a little bit late with baby Penelope "],["48.83","and when Ryan stepped around the corner "],["51.26","held up the baby car seats it changed "],["54.199","the whole mood of the room everyone "],["56.9","stopped all the conversations and we all "],["59.269","just took a moment to admire the baby "],["61.91","how small and how cute and how precious "],["66.59","she is and the proud new parents bask in "],["70.159","the observations because that's exactly "],["72.05","how they feel Joe and Terry we're "],["74.9","sitting in the lobby last Sunday

"],["113.54","captures our imagination it's a scene "],["116.15","that every person from every nation from "],["118.43","every period of time can relate to "],["120.38","whether you're rich or poor

like "],["157.26","all right my job's done let's see what "],["159.24","else is next you know that was me I had "],["162.9","to be very old-school with the birth of "],["165.27","my first son Robbie he was emergency "],["167.58","c-section so I couldn't go into the "],["170.1","delivery room I had to wait out in the "],["171.39","hall and that was the good old days "],["172.92","right guys who you remembered like "],["174.09","standing in the hall and just pacing "],["175.77","some of you remember those days now you "],["177.54","get to go in and be a part of it but he "],["179.82","was kind of breached with the cord "],["182.04","wrapped around his neck and it was kind "],["183.48","of scared he's - oh we almost didn't get "],["185.46","him out now Ricky he was a planned "],["186.75","c-section so I got to go in for that "],["188.22","procedure and I'll never forget that he "],["190.41","was he was sideways and he wouldn't turn "],["192.6","just kind of head this way and feet this "],["195.33","way apparently all the McNutt children "],["197.91","were just too big for Ileana to actually "],["199.65","birth them naturally so we were just "],["201.24","causing problems Ricky Robbie was over "],["203.79","eight pounds Ricky was nine six "],["205.68","you know just big I'll never forget they "],["209.97","cut Eliana open and they took what "],["211.95","looked like a big ice cube scoop that "],["215.7","you'd see at a hotel ice machine and "],["219.12","they stuck it in her belly here and they "],["221.04","popped his head out this way and just "],["222.99","come up comes Ricky you know it's a "],["225.18","straight out of this incision it was "],["226.53","wild like aliens man just boom my role "],["233.43","is very limited in the birth of my sons "],["235.05","but I can relate to Joseph trying to get "],["237.21","his wife to a safe place to deliver "],["239.1","these babies trying to protect and "],["240.63","provide all the while feeling very very "],["242.88","helpless through the whole thing how "],["244.74","much more can all relate to the physical "],["248.31","and emotional experience as one goes "],["250.68","through when they give birth all can "],["252.87","think about Mary in that moment without "],["254.55","a doctor without a midwife without a "],["256.32","nurse not even her mom for goodness sake "],["258.27","just a awkward husband that's all she "],["261.63","had in a barn sounds traumatic and yet "],["265.17","when we read this simple description of "],["267.09","Luke chapter 2 verse number seven when "],["269.61","we read this simple verse we always "],["271.89","interpret it as a beautiful loving scene "],["274.82","and she gave birth to her firstborn son "],["277.77","that's it so easy wrapped him in cloths "],["281.01","and laid him in a manger because there "],["283.26","was no room for them in the end it's "],["286.29","such a "],["286.719","it's such a we always visualize "],["288.219","visualize it as this loving scene so "],["291.039","much so it it's depiction is now iconic "],["293.529","isn't it we put the scene up and put it "],["295.839","on our our banners to parents just "],["300.069","standing there in awe and wonder because "],["303.219","after all of the stress and the labor "],["305.319","when it's all over "],["307.029","that is how parents feel isn't it we "],["309.549","feel in awe and wonder that's what we "],["315.699","all feel when we see this newborn for "],["317.349","the first time so we can relate to this "],["318.909","scene but when you add to the fact that "],["322.329","it's not just Mary son this is the son "],["326.979","of God that adds an extra aw to it "],["330.61","doesn't it look at what it said here in "],["332.709","Luke chapter 1 verse 26 126 of Luke now "],["339.879","the sixth month the angel Gabriel was "],["342.039","sent from God to the city of Galilee "],["344.469","called Nazareth to a virgin engaged to a "],["346.599","man who was named Joseph descendant of "],["348.849","David and the Virgin's name was Mary "],["351.029","coming in he said to her greetings "],["353.649","favored one the Lord is with you but she "],["355.539","was perplexed by this statement here's "],["357.969","an angel Wow "],["359.019","kept partner and what kind of salutation "],["361.389","this was and the angel said do not be "],["362.949","afraid Mary for you have found favor "],["365.019","with God behold you will conceive in "],["367.809","your womb and bear a son and you shall "],["369.969","call his name Jesus he will be great and "],["373.389","will be called the son of the Most High "],["375.729","and the Lord God will give him the "],["377.86","throne of his father David and he will "],["380.529","reign over the house of Jacob forever "],["382.089","his kingdom will have no end "],["384.999","Mary said to the angel how can this be "],["387.61","since I am a virgin the angel said the "],["390.039","Holy Spirit will come upon you and the "],["391.809","power the most high will overshadow you "],["393.459","and for that reason the Holy Child will "],["396.699","be called the son of God the Son of God "],["401.229","so there's an aspect of this story that "],["403.659","we can relate to but then there's this "],["405.969","other aspect that we have nothing like "],["408.369","this has ever been happened ever "],["410.05","it's uncompounded what does this mean "],["417.069","for God does it mean for God the son of "],["420.43","God ponder that for a moment God the "],["422.74","Creator the one who is transcended "],["426.34","outside of time in space the one who is "],["429.49","beyond our physical realm in reality is "],["432.64","going to become one of us and not just "],["436.48","materialized as a man in his prime but "],["439.93","he's going to come as a frail helpless "],["442.69","baby and trust his life to the care of "],["446.02","his creation knowing how limited and "],["450.25","finite how weak and susceptible the "],["452.62","human body is much less the baby that "],["455.14","can't even feed himself that's how God "],["457.39","came to us in that lowly form not really "],["462.43","much of a God not not very impressive or "],["465.31","powerful one might initially think but "],["468.13","when you think and it is an act of "],["471.28","incredible power and strength to take on "],["474.34","the weakest helpless form and know that "],["477.58","you're still going to be protected "],["479.52","knowing that the plan is still going to "],["481.84","work that that is the ultimate show of "],["484.42","power to strip away everything and then "],["488.65","still be in control at the same time "],["490.8","what better way to prove that you are "],["493.15","eminent within your creation and still "],["495.25","transcended outside of it what better "],["497.44","way to show that you are omnipresent to "],["500.05","be helpless babe and still Creator God "],["502.36","holding everything together at the same "],["504.07","time what better way to show you were "],["507.01","all-powerful when you know that your "],["510.19","adversary the devil wants to destroy you "],["512.17","and you make yourself completely "],["513.7","vulnerable and he still can't get to you "],["516.27","the devil still couldn't get in the "],["519.07","upper hand even when Jesus was a baby he "],["521.74","couldn't capitalize on that so many "],["524.14","layers of miraculous going on here we "],["526.69","could never completely understand what "],["529.03","this means for God to be man all we can "],["534.34","do is what Mary did in Luke chapter 2 "],["538.06","verse 19 where it simply said but Mary "],["541.42","treasured all of these things pondering "],["545.38","them in her hearts pondering what what "],["549.79","does that mean "],["550.66","I posed that question to "],["553.6","the church Thursday afternoon I sent you "],["555.759","an email and I said I'm curious to hear "],["557.649","what you think she was pondering

so you went back and you did a "],["603.819","history lesson and you said well Mary "],["605.38","got the message from the angel and then "],["607.06","she went and visited her cousin "],["609.19","Elizabeth and then the Shepherd's "],["610.87","testimony and the even new prophecy so "],["613.63","all of these things encompassed all of "],["615.279","that you made that observation some of "],["616.87","you zoomed in on the action words the "],["618.939","verbs and you defined them Mary "],["620.23","treasured and she pondered and treasured "],["623.68","is this is this

"],["546.649","were fulfilled in Jesus lifetime Old "],["549.019","Testament prophecies amazing Christmas "],["551.99","the coming of Jesus was worth the wait "],["555.579","only one problem what's the problem "],["560.019","specifically what's the problem with "],["561.889","this angel's message first number 31 it "],["565.399","says you will conceive in your womb and "],["568.16","bear a child you call his name Jesus got "],["569.72","that right he will be great verse 32 the "],["572.779","son of the Most High and the Lord God "],["574.16","will give him the throne of his father "],["575.48","David he will reign over the house of "],["577.22","Jacob forever his kingdom will have no "],["579.019","end what's the problem hasn't happened "],["584.389","yet has it that still hasn't happened "],["586.67","now some folks will say well he in a "],["589.309","spiritual realm it has happened mark 16 "],["592.91","verse number 19 so then the Lord had "],["594.589","spoken to them he was received up into "],["596.029","heaven and sat down at the right hand of "],["598.129","God so there's no greater throne than "],["600.019","the throne of heaven obviously that is "],["602.869","an eternal throne yes but that's not "],["605.209","what the prophecies called for Micah "],["608.269","chapter 4 and up verse number 7 says the "],["610.249","Lord will reign over them from Mount "],["611.929","Zion forever see we take scripture very "],["617.749","literally the Lord promised David's "],["621.11","throne in Israel in the land in "],["623.689","Jerusalem in Zion the Messiah would "],["625.819","reign that's what the angel foretold "],["628.639","that has not happens Jesus has never "],["632.149","ruled on an earthly throne so there's "],["635.209","two conclusions one can cop with one the "],["639.379","angel lied and it's not going to happen "],["641.749","or it still has to come and we have to "],["648.019","keep waiting as we've already stated "],["652.339","Jesus came and fulfilled over 300 "],["654.74","prophecies in his lifetime the biggest "],["656.509","one being he was crucified he was buried "],["659.629","and he and he rose again and which is "],["663.35","the whole point of his first coming so "],["665.389","it's a proven fact that Jesus did come "],["667.879","even if you don't believe in Jesus "],["670.07","who he was the facts are still the facts "],["672.5","Jesus was born and fulfilled prophecy "],["674.39","and God didn't lie on that point if you "],["676.79","believe in Jesus if you believe the "],["678.23","Bible the only conclusion you can come "],["679.79","to is the prophecy is still unfinished "],["682.85","it's just uncomplete and that we can all "],["685.79","agree on but incomplete is not the same "],["688.94","as wrong is it due to the fact that it "],["691.55","took over an estimated four thousand "],["694.01","years since the prophecy was made the "],["695.42","eve till Jesus came it took over two "],["698.03","thousand years since the promises were "],["699.56","made to Abraham till Jesus came what "],["702.2","that indicates to us is the fact that "],["704.12","waiting a long time for a fulfilled "],["706.58","prophecy is not uncommon in Scripture "],["710.26","just because it takes a long time "],["712.58","doesn't prove that God's not going to do "],["714.56","it or God has changed his mind or he's "],["716.99","failed no no God transcends time and his "],["721.34","appointed times are only known by him "],["724.19","and they'll only be done when he deems "],["726.83","the time has come "],["728.8","delay is not derailments which means we "],["733.85","have to do what all you people of God we "],["738.08","have to do the same thing that the "],["739.25","people of God all down through the "],["740.48","millennia have had to do we have to "],["742.39","waits for Christmas and not get tired of "],["746.96","waiting so we're all still waiting for "],["749.33","another Christmas another time when "],["750.89","Christ will be sent when he's coming "],["753.65","back again now when he came the first "],["756.47","time even though there were all these "],["758.15","prophecies you know most people missed "],["759.68","it didn't they wasn't a grand "],["762.17","celebration on earth when he came the "],["765.05","first time it was a poor couple all "],["767.69","alone a hundred miles away from home in "],["770.48","a place where animals were kept that's "],["772.76","how Jesus came the only people that knew "],["774.68","about it were some shepherds that got "],["776.6","the news from some angels so they went "],["779.36","to visit Jesus Mary and Joseph and that "],["781.52","was it everyone else missed it didn't "],["786.17","they "],["786.47","and nobody really understood how and why "],["789.74","he came in that manner until after his "],["792.65","crucifixion and resurrection after the "],["795.95","prophecies were fulfilled then people "],["797.78","got it uh which was okay it was God's "],["801.65","intention for Jesus to come in that "],["803.3","manner "],["803.81","why didn't he want why didn't God want "],["806.15","everyone to know the first time two "],["809.779","reasons first reasons for jesus safety "],["813.16","because you remember as the story "],["815.12","unfolds in matthew chapter 2 we learned "],["816.86","that the wise men who saw the star and "],["819.29","knew that was the sign and showed up "],["821.12","into jerusalem saying hey where's the "],["823.1","where's the where's the king that was "],["824.48","born that didn't work out so well for "],["827.21","the kids did it because hair got all "],["829.7","irate and he went over there to "],["830.99","bethlehem and killed all the children "],["832.22","and he was trying to protect his power "],["835.029","and he saw he saw the the newborn king "],["837.98","as a threat and so once we saw that we "],["841.279","realized the general population missing "],["843.74","the arrival that was okay probably a "],["847.46","good thing the number two reason why God "],["850.4","didn't want everyone to know is because "],["851.75","Jesus wasn't coming to rule was he he "],["855.2","didn't come to earth to rule it wasn't "],["857.27","it's time for that he was coming to "],["858.62","serve he if they made him a king the "],["862.07","first time he would have been able to do "],["863.93","what he came to do which was to lay down "],["865.61","his life to sacrifice himself for the "],["867.83","sin of the whole world so it was "],["869.27","perfectly okay for people to miss his "],["871.13","first coming and then believe on it "],["873.14","after the fact which is what we've all "],["874.97","done right we now believe on it after "],["877.13","the fact now that is not the case when "],["881.39","he returns it's not okay for people to "],["884.51","miss his coming again and believe after "],["887.48","the fact because he's not coming back as "],["890.089","infant lowly infant holy in a lowly "],["893.15","cattle stall no he's coming back to "],["895.01","fulfill prophecies as the angel has "],["897.5","spoken here that he will be great and "],["899.75","he'll be called the son of the Most High "],["901.1","and the Lord God will give him the "],["902.81","throne of David and he will reign over "],["904.4","the house of Jacob and his kingdom will "],["906.44","have no end "],["908.23","that's what how he's coming back to rule "],["910.97","the earth and when he does nobody's "],["914.51","gonna miss this one says in Matthew "],["916.61","chapter 24 and then the sign of the Son "],["920.42","of Man will appear in the sky and all "],["922.339","the tribes of the earth will mourn while "],["925.16","he morning and be scared because they're "],["927.62","going to see the Son of man coming in "],["929.029","the clouds

"],["935.959","winds and from "],["937.1","the ends of the sky to the other when he "],["940.04","comes back to rain what does that mean "],["942.08","for all the people who think they're in "],["943.49","control who want to continue to keep "],["945.32","their control it will mean is that those "],["947.87","people who don't trust in Jesus and "],["950.05","think that their religions are okay "],["952.25","they're in for a rude awakening our "],["953.96","thing okay this is gonna sound really "],["958.07","weird but I'm gonna point it out anyways "],["962.8","have you noticed all the plots of movies "],["966.17","nowadays that deal with some alien "],["968.24","taking over the earth or either some "],["971.99","chosen superhero mankind has to fight "],["974.77","against them and all the movie plots the "],["977.93","alien taking over is bad and destructive "],["980.54","but the hero prevents it and they save "],["982.91","mankind and they saved the earth and you "],["986.15","know once you get to be my age you "],["987.41","realize you've seen the same movie a "],["988.82","thousand times some of you know what I'm "],["991.07","talking about right the same plot the "],["992.66","same story's told over and over and over "],["994.46","you know marble and the Transformers "],["997.1","they keep telling the same story well so "],["1000.49","why'd it's science fiction yeah I know "],["1001.75","big deal right I mean why they can't "],["1006.46","come up with some new ideas is a little "],["1007.69","bit odd but that's how it is but the "],["1009.88","other thing you notice when you study "],["1011.77","prophecy and you take God's Word "],["1013.27","literally when you believe in Jesus when "],["1015.31","you're looking for his coming literal "],["1017.74","Messiah who's going to overthrow the "],["1019.39","corrupt rulers of the world and destroy "],["1021.07","all who oppose him and and take over and "],["1023.92","rebuild

"],["1031.87","place where it stands against God's laws "],["1034.06","and against God's standard of truth the "],["1036.13","other thing you notice is all of these "],["1039.04","movies are telling

to talk about today basically "],["628.01","someone asked jesus himself what is the "],["631.01","most important thing it's red letters so "],["634.13","we have confirmation that it's Jesus "],["636.17","speaking right we all know whether oh "],["639.07","that was added after the original text "],["642.23","was written but the translators put it "],["644.54","in red letters for us so we

people listen yeah those "],["656.48","of you don't you can look it up later "],["657.74","i'm dating myself but this is Jesus "],["660.62","talking so when he have Hutton Pete "],["662.18","speaks

"],["670.94","I'm dating myself moving on Jesus answer "],["673.13","the question of what is most important "],["675.17","with love love for God and for our "],["677.54","neighbors so when people ask questions "],["679.25","like what is the meaning of life it's "],["682.13","not "],["682.88","42 as the hitchhiker's guide to the "],["684.92","galaxy states what's the point why are "],["687.08","you here what is this thing what is the "],["689.45","thing what is the most important thing "],["690.8","in our lives I think we as Christians "],["693.16","need to have love be the first thing "],["695.66","that pops into our mind and out of our "],["697.37","mouth in order to answer that question "],["698.72","love God and love our neighbors that's "],["701.6","the most important thing that's what "],["702.98","Jesus said so that ought to pop into our "],["705.14","minds when we asked questions that are "],["706.76","similar so what is this love that you "],["708.56","speak of you've heard pastor Robb talk "],["710.63","about the different forms of love in the "],["712.25","Greek there's eros where we get our "],["714.77","romantic one I mean we're kind of the "],["717.38","society today teaches valentine's Day is "],["719.6","all about roses and cards and hearts and "],["722.75","flowers and diamonds and all other stuff "],["725.18","but is that really the love that we're "],["727.46","talking about here I think we all know "],["729.11","it's not this is the love that the world "],["732.05","wants us to focus on though whenever you "],["733.94","see movies or TV shows or hear anything "],["736.79","that has to do with relationships "],["737.87","between people you hear the term love "],["740.48","used but what you see in the imagery "],["742.94","that's put before you and in the plot "],["744.95","line is sexual activity in lust that's "],["747.47","what you see that's what the world wants "],["749.24","you to believe love is because if you "],["751.73","have an unban of what love is you can't "],["756.26","translate the original scripture that we "],["758.42","put up here which is love your love God "],["760.37","and love your neighbor because when you "],["762.47","think about God you think about romantic "],["764.15","love ooh right no one wants to think "],["766.91","about that that's not how we are "],["768.59","supposed to be thinking about God but "],["770.12","Satan is deceiving us he's turning our "],["773.42","society and he has for years and years "],["775.49","and years for time

and love is one of the central "],["787.16","themes that Satan has tried to take "],["789.71","control of and use for his purposes for "],["792.92","the since the beginning of time we've "],["794.57","been lied to that's not the love that "],["796.28","Jesus was talking about Satan would "],["798.08","happily have us believe that this is the "],["800.12","definition of love because when we hear "],["801.74","Jesus say love God and then our "],["803.45","definition of love is that which is "],["804.95","provided by Hollywood it just doesn't "],["806.78","translate how can you love God if you "],["809.12","have a faulty definition of what love is "],["810.91","people start to stray from the truth "],["813.23","when they don't understand they're very "],["815.21","heart of a war "],["816.18","that is being used while eros isn't "],["819.3","specifically called out in Scripture it "],["820.86","is referred to in the Song of Solomon "],["822.24","but for today's purposes it's important "],["825.21","for us to just recognize that this is "],["826.77","not the love that has talked about when "],["829.08","jesus said love God and love your "],["831.42","neighbor there's also story a love "],["833.25","that's the family love you see the the "],["835.17","mother and father kissing the child "],["836.61","there there's no mention of store gay "],["839.67","love

formed that's what a lot of "],["866.73","people translate that love to be this "],["869.279","form of love is actually mentioned in "],["871.2","Scripture and when it's talking about "],["873.089","filet filet o love in Scripture it's "],["875.88","talking about the love between brothers "],["877.8","and sisters of Christ so that though is "],["880.98","not the type of love that

whatever you want to call him was "],["891.48","agape love it's the unconditional love "],["896.209","we've probably talked about agape love a "],["898.83","few hundred times but to refresh

"],["1002.54","would call a definition in my book less "],["1004.79","is is followed by like it is like "],["1007.22","something then it is giving us a "],["1009.11","definition or a defining

explain what I mean this week I've "],["89.97","been studying the word power throughout "],["92.58","the New Testament and I felt that there "],["94.5","was something elusive about the way the "],["96.81","New Testament used this work that there "],["99.27","was something more that I needed to look "],["101.19","into so I did and I found four important "],["105.24","ways that the New Testament used power "],["108.39","and that these go beyond what would be "],["112.979","normally used for the word power "],["114.84","basically power means the ability to do "],["118.11","something that resides in some one so "],["122.22","when we talk about power normally we "],["124.619","might say something like it's not in my "],["127.44","power to do that so like dick nebula "],["130.83","might say it's not in my power to make "],["133.98","that church building back there get "],["136.23","finished so stop asking me know "],["141.6","right is it's not in his power he can't "],["144.49","himself finish that building right and "],["148.06","as humans we really don't have much "],["150.76","power and other times we talk about "],["154.42","power in in reference to might like we "],["158.2","have all sorts of might in the most "],["160.93","general way so God is all-powerful and "],["164.77","he's mighty enough to do anything he has "],["168.52","all the power but when we take those "],["172.63","general references out of our pool of "],["175.42","verses about power we're left with some "],["178","specific aspects of power specific "],["181.24","things that we might think as odd to "],["183.67","have power and power working in "],["185.65","interesting places so there are four "],["189.43","interesting aspects of the word power in "],["191.89","the New Testament that I found and they "],["194.05","are first power shown in miracles second "],["198.19","power through the Holy Spirit third "],["200.67","gospel power and finally power at work "],["204.7","in us the first interesting aspect of "],["209.41","power in the New Testament is power "],["211.84","shown in miracles at the beginning of "],["215.11","the New Testament Jesus steps on the "],["217.57","scene and he has the strength to do "],["221.67","supernatural stuff he heals the "],["224.65","terminally ill he makes the plying the "],["227.23","blind people able to see he casts out "],["230.14","demons this is power in action power at "],["234.79","work not powering a general or anything "],["240.85","like frail human power but this is power "],["243.61","like no one has ever seen before now "],["247.12","Matthew tells us about people's reaction "],["249.76","to Jesus's power in Matthew 1453 he says "],["254.35","coming to his hometown he began teaching "],["257.14","the people in their synagogues and they "],["259.39","were amazed where did this man get this "],["262.27","wisdom and these miraculous powers the "],["265.9","question where did this man get the "],["268.96","ability to do these things this is "],["272.74","something being "],["274.24","what is natural no man has the ability "],["276.55","to do anything like this and that's "],["279.22","exactly why Jesus performed miracles "],["282.99","Jesus proved to the world that he was "],["286.18","supernatural through the miracles that "],["289.24","he did where did this man get these "],["291.849","Wizards wisdom and these miraculous "],["294.49","powers he got them from himself because "],["298.539","he was God he had the ability within "],["301.96","himself to heal the sick to give the "],["304.99","blind sight and they cast out demons "],["308.19","Jesus had miraculous power he brought "],["312.069","the idea the guy generally has all power "],["315.46","and he threw it right in people's faces "],["319.74","God not only has supernatural power but "],["323.229","his son Jesus is using that power to "],["326.8","take what is it broke and to fix it "],["330.81","that's pretty amazing stuff now the next "],["334.3","big aspect of power in the New Testament "],["336.52","is power through the Holy Spirit Jesus "],["340.99","as we've already seen he has miraculous "],["344.139","power the ability to do amazing things "],["346.62","he tells his disciples this but you will "],["350.919","receive power when the Holy Spirit comes "],["353.59","upon you and you will be my witnesses in "],["356.11","Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria "],["358.84","and to the ends of the earth the "],["362.169","disciples received this power and they "],["365.469","were able to perform miracles like Jesus "],["368.139","did now obviously the disciples were "],["370.75","just men like you and I or women not "],["374.86","like me but like you some of you so they "],["378.4","did not have the power in themselves to "],["381.61","do the miraculous the disciples had no "],["385.75","divine nature that gave them the power "],["387.819","to do anything that power came from the "],["391.599","Spirit of God the Holy Spirit of God "],["394.889","gave them the power of God to do things "],["399.58","that only God could and the spirits "],["403.089","power in the disciples like Jesus's "],["406","miracles showed the world that "],["408.08","something supernatural was happening in "],["410.96","them those miracles proved that God's "],["413.87","power was at work in the disciples they "],["417.379","proved that the message that these guys "],["419.479","preached about God's Son dying for their "],["422.75","sins and rising again the miracles "],["426.5","proved that that message was from God "],["429.86","himself now the next use of power in the "],["433.4","New Testament is really interesting to "],["435.71","me it's where a few questions started "],["438.139","upon in Romans 116 Paul says for I am "],["443.3","not ashamed of the gospel because it is "],["445.34","the power of God that brings salvation "],["447.86","to everyone who believes first to the "],["450.77","Jew then to the Gentile so Paul is "],["454.43","saying here that the gospel is the power "],["457.759","of God basically the gospel is power "],["463.719","just reading the definition of power "],["466.219","into that verse how can the gospel have "],["469.4","the ability to bring salvation how can "],["473.21","the gospel itself be the power of God "],["477.669","now Paul says something similar in first "],["480.44","Corinthians 118 about gospel power he "],["483.05","says for the message of the Cross is "],["485.839","foolishness to those who are perishing "],["487.789","but to us who are being saved it is the "],["490.909","power of God according to Paul the "],["495.169","message of the Cross that Christ came "],["498.319","down to earth and died for our sins that "],["502.729","is the power of God but that still "],["507.259","doesn't answer how the gospel itself has "],["510.05","power and what that power even means is "],["513.589","in the gospel just a message isn't it "],["517.07","just a story a powerful story "],["520.449","nonetheless but it seems like still a "],["523.399","story reading through some of these "],["525.74","passages it makes it seem like God's "],["527.93","supernatural power sits behind the "],["530.57","message of the gospel in some way I mean "],["534.38","listen to some of these passages in "],["535.97","first Corinthians Paul tells the "],["537.86","Corinthians how he shared the gospel "],["539.959","with them he says "],["541.74","my message in my preaching were not with "],["543.87","wise and persuasive words but with a "],["545.73","demonstration of the spirit's power so "],["548.46","that your faith may not rest on human "],["550.44","wisdom but on God's power Paul's message "],["554.94","and his preaching was not with human "],["557.7","wisdom but with a demonstration of the "],["560.37","spirit's power now right there it sounds "],["563.88","to me like Paul is saying that his "],["566.43","preaching gave the Corinthians a taste "],["568.86","of God's power so that they could put "],["572.22","their belief in God's power instead of "],["575.58","just wise words from Paul so the "],["579.69","inherent power of the gospel was the "],["583.68","foundation of their faith now later on "],["587.1","Paul hits the same point again he says "],["588.96","for the kingdom of God is not a matter "],["591.3","of talk but of power the kingdom of God "],["595.86","is about preaching words with power not "],["599.7","preaching persuasively so apparently "],["603.33","there's some power within the gospel "],["605.76","itself that is the basis for our faith "],["609.09","in second Corinthians Paul puts it this "],["611.94","way we have this treasure the gospel in "],["615.2","jars of clay and there he's talking "],["617.43","about Christians to show that this all "],["620.61","surpassing power is from God and not "],["623.97","from us so this gospel we contain it as "],["629.46","only jars of clay so people can see that "],["633.42","this gospel power is from God and not "],["636.09","from us the Gospels ability to "],["640.17","accomplish is not from us it's from God "],["643.13","we're just simple clay vessels that are "],["645.93","normal boring breakable jars but "],["649.86","contained inside of us is this all "],["652.34","surpassing power from God called the "],["655.77","gospel and when people look at us they "],["659.07","see wow this guy's just a normal boring "],["663.5","breakable container for something "],["666.27","amazing inside and as I was reading "],["670.71","through these uses of power in the New "],["672.45","Testament I could not help but be in "],["675.47","treat by this power and something so "],["678.86","special that it's worth grounding our "],["681.41","faith on it's something that when people "],["684.05","get a taste of it they know that it is "],["687.5","God just like the miracles of Jesus that "],["689.93","proved that he was God were the miracles "],["692.18","the disciples did through the Holy "],["693.98","Spirit that proved that their message "],["696.29","was from God the gospel has power in "],["700.07","itself to prove that it is from God and "],["703.25","not from then so what is this power that "],["706.94","we're supposed to base our faith on that "],["710","is within the gospel I think one final "],["715.07","aspect of the word power in the New "],["717.2","Testament really brought things together "],["719.92","and it reveals a lot to us Paul "],["723.29","concludes the book of Ephesians this way "],["725.74","he says now to him who is able to do "],["729.23","immeasurably more than all we ask or "],["731.66","imagine according to his power that is "],["734.66","at work in us okay so here Paul states "],["738.44","that God's power that could do way more "],["741.89","than anything that we could ask or "],["744.8","imagine that that's inside of us not "],["748.13","only that but it's at work in us so "],["751.79","there is power inside of us from God to "],["755","do way more than we could ever ask power "],["759.64","inside of us now i'm just a normal human "],["762.92","being I don't feel like there's some "],["765.23","above normal power inside of me I'm not "],["769.55","doing what Jesus or the disciples did "],["771.68","I'm not healing the sick I'm not "],["774.44","bringing blind men to site not casting "],["777.56","demons out and if it's not power in that "],["781.31","sense in what power do we have this "],["784.73","power or in what sense do we have this "],["788.45","power inside of us now here's another "],["792.05","interesting verse we constantly pray for "],["795.5","you that our God may make you worthy of "],["797.78","his calling and that by his power he may "],["800.93","bring to fruition your every desire for "],["803.48","goodness and your everyday prompted by "],["805.73","faith so Paul prays for "],["808.94","us believers then we would by God's "],["812.66","power within us bring about every desire "],["816.02","and every good deed faith prompts that "],["820.78","God's power will give us the ability to "],["825.8","do good things so God's power is working "],["829.91","in us to help us do good things that we "],["833.38","could only think about on our own he's "],["836.96","the one giving us the ability to do them "],["839.8","and I think one last verse about power "],["843.29","really brought things together for me "],["845.51","and it's odd because Paul describes not "],["847.85","what gospel power looks like but the "],["850.88","opposite he talks about what godliness "],["853.79","without power looks like so in first and "],["857.57","in second Timothy 3 2 through 5 Paul "],["860.33","says of those who claim to be Christian "],["862.85","but don't look like it that they will be "],["865.85","lovers of themselves lovers of money "],["868.36","boastful proud abusive disobedient to "],["872.48","their parents dot dot dot he just keeps "],["875.45","going every bad behavior you can imagine "],["878.26","and then he comes and puts in this big "],["882.74","dash and he explains that people who "],["884.9","claim to be Christians and are doing "],["887.18","these disobedient things that they have "],["889.67","a form of godliness but denying its "],["893.03","power now this is just the opposite of "],["896.27","the last verse that we just studied in "],["899.27","the last verse guys power and abled "],["902.33","Christians to do good and in this worse "],["908.38","people are claiming to be Christians but "],["910.64","they're not doing good so they are "],["914.089","missing the power the ability to do what "],["917.72","is good the ability to do the things "],["921.05","that God wants them to do they have a "],["924.589","form of godliness so in the dark they "],["927.8","might have a silhouette of godliness but "],["930.47","when the light comes on it looks nothing "],["933.53","like it then denying God's power to "],["937.67","change their lives they deny power to "],["941.54","give them the strength "],["942.8","to do what God calls is good and right "],["947","there i think that the Gospels power "],["949.07","makes sense right there that's something "],["952.01","that we can hold on to that the gospel "],["955.01","gives us the ability to do what is good "],["957.23","when we only have the power to do what "],["960.68","is wrong the gospel gives us a taste of "],["963.62","God's power because the gospel gives us "],["966.98","the power to change something that we "],["970.519","cannot do on our own and it is this "],["973.43","power the godliness depends on it is "],["976.7","this power that is essential to people "],["979.399","coming to faith in Christ then power "],["982.49","something miraculous something that "],["984.74","proves that God is behind this message "],["987.98","the power to change is the power of the "],["991.82","gospel that we put our faith we put our "],["995.45","faith in the power of God so we talked "],["999.589","about the uselessness of devices without "],["1002.14","power in the beginning I think now we "],["1004.99","can see how useless the crosses without "],["1008.709","God's power and how useless the churches "],["1012.19","without God's power take the cross it's "],["1016.66","just sitting there it's wood on a wall "],["1020.02","in a certain shape has no practical "],["1023.14","purpose except well I guess the Romans "],["1025.9","invented it to kill people so it means "],["1029.429","nothing without power but the crosses "],["1033.91","power is that Jesus was crucified on it "],["1037.839","to free us from sin so that we could be "],["1041.47","made like God the power of this cross is "],["1044.77","not so that we could have a cool wall "],["1047.14","decoration in our churches the power of "],["1050.2","this cross is not so that we could be "],["1052.51","it's even not so that we could be saved "],["1054.7","from eternal damnation in hell the power "],["1058.3","of this cross is that we can be changed "],["1062.16","we can be made new instead of hiding in "],["1065.86","the darkness we can live in the light "],["1067.78","instead of cowering behind our fear we "],["1070.6","can act in confidence because we know "],["1073.24","that we are the children of God instead "],["1076.76","being slaves to our flesh we can be "],["1079.19","slaves to righteousness that is the "],["1083.24","power of the cross that's why the gospel "],["1086.21","is salvation to us because we don't have "],["1089.03","to stay this broken person that we are "],["1092.53","therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a "],["1095.6","new creature the old things have passed "],["1098.39","away behold new things have come it's "],["1103.16","true of the cross and it's true of the "],["1106.07","church we're just a bunch of people who "],["1108.86","get together on sunday mornings in talk "],["1111.17","and sing if there's no power we're just "],["1115.01","only a little club of people like to do "],["1117.71","stuff together if there's no power but i "],["1122.3","believe something greater is going on "],["1124.61","here i believe that the gospel is in "],["1127.25","this church and then the gospel is in "],["1129.83","the hearts of us people and that God is "],["1134.06","taking old things that he's making them "],["1137","new right here in our midst I believe "],["1140.81","that God's power is here at faith bible "],["1143.87","church well simple test right what has "],["1149.66","God made new here at faith bible church "],["1153.19","well let me start with me mark lindgren "],["1155.69","the one who posed the question that "],["1157.79","should be the first to try and answer it "],["1160.78","what his guide made knew about me well "],["1164.69","I've been here at faith bible church "],["1166.42","well to start with I was saved at a "],["1169.91","youth event that faith bible church "],["1173.36","youth group went on so i came to know "],["1177.2","the power of the gospel while I've been "],["1179.66","here and at that time i was a broken and "],["1183.68","jumbled mess i was severely depressed i "],["1188.59","had isolated myself from the love of my "],["1191.51","family and my friends I felt worthless "],["1195.58","valueless totally lost I tried to I had "],["1201.41","tried to be more popular I tried to be "],["1204.02","more funny I tried to feel like my life "],["1207.5","had meaning and all that gave me "],["1210.94","but then God stepped in he said to me "],["1215.48","that he wanted a relationship with me "],["1218.53","and that's powerful but God didn't stop "],["1222.53","there he didn't just start a "],["1224.84","relationship with me and leave me with a "],["1227.69","broken minded a despairing heart he "],["1231.05","changed me he empowered me to be free "],["1234.62","from the tangled web of lies in my head "],["1237.17","and the selfishness in my heart he built "],["1240.68","me a new foundation for his meaning and "],["1243.86","value in his love for me and he's just "],["1248.48","getting started there's way way more "],["1252.38","work to be done in my life and God has "],["1255.83","not done and I thank him so much for "],["1259.7","that so I'm going to pose the question "],["1264.2","to some others in here what has what "],["1268.85","changed his faith bible church brought "],["1270.65","in your life what is the gospel really "],["1273.29","here that's my question and i know that "],["1276.77","there is proof right in here and i "],["1279.68","believe that it's in you okay i feel "],["1284.18","like i can say the gods power and so

"],["1344.57","and see all of the same that God has "],["1347.659","killed in our hearts with that cross to "],["1351.799","see how far God's power has allowed us "],["1354.529","to come and then we
