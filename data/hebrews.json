"],["748.959","servant whoever desires to be first let "],["752.24","him be your slave just as the son of man "],["756.24","does not come to be served but to serve "],["759.519","and give his life as a ransom for many "],["762.199","and so many pastors forget that part "],["764.399","they get the title and the position and "],["765.88","next thing you know it goes to their "],["766.959","head and they begin demanding everyone "],["769.959","respect their Authority respect my "],["772.519","authority that's what they want once "],["775.68","that happens it's not going to end well "],["778.279","it never does does but here's the thing "],["781.48","those pastors "],["783.32","generally do not think they're doing "],["785.32","anything wrong they assume they're right "],["788.36","and they even have a good "],["789.88","conscience as it says here pray for us "],["793","for we are confident that we have a good "],["794.56","conscience and all things Desiring to "],["796.279","live "],["797.079","honorably lots of "],["799.279","actions that seem obviously wrong to "],["801.48","most people can be justified the person "],["803.279","by the person doing them because he's "],["805.839","confident that his motives are pure we "],["809.279","we we've seen this situation several "],["810.839","times you know and particularly one I "],["812.48","was thinking of Iana uh Pastor making "],["815.12","decisions that he was confident were "],["816.92","what was best for the ministries of the "],["818.32","church meanwhile the other leaders were "],["820.24","confident he was wrong and their ideas "],["822.12","were what was best so there was a big "],["823.959","disagreement and fighting which resulted "],["826","in bad feelings which resulted in "],["828.24","mistrust and resentment that hurt both "],["830.959","the pastor and the church members and "],["833","after four years the pastor could not "],["834.88","wait to get out of that church and many "],["836.759","of the members were happy to see him go "],["839.24","see you later buddy and that was sad "],["842.16","because he wasn't an evil guy he really "],["844.56","did love the Lord he wanted to preach "],["846.079","the gospel he wanted people to believe "],["847.48","in Jesus and the members too they "],["849.32","weren't evil people they believed in "],["851.079","Jesus they wanted to see people come and "],["853.16","trust in the Lord and they should have "],["855.399","worked very well together so why "],["858.079","couldn't "],["860","they because they're just "],["862.24","people have you noticed that people are "],["865.32","challenging to work "],["866.88","with I mean not here "],["869.24","I'm talking "],["870.36","about other places in "],["873.44","general and pastors are people too "],["877.92","imperfect flawed deficient people "],["881.639","therefore we need a lot of prayer Elon "],["885.44","and I work together every day what could "],["889.24","possibly go wrong "],["891.759","there pray for "],["894.32","us well Pastor Rob what what what should "],["897.199","we pray for you for "],["899.839","for okay for the

"],["911.16","like to sound whiny or like I'm "],["913.24","complaining however since I believe "],["915.959","prayer is effective and powerful and "],["918.56","since the passage tells you all to pray "],["921.079","for me and pray for the spiritual "],["922.92","leaders I think if we're going to take "],["925.639","it literally I need to give you some "],["927.959","things to pray about

"],["978.199","being good I it's never been a strong "],["980.399","suit for me so consequently I make a lot "],["982.24","of mistakes because I'm "],["985.68","in "],["987.36","inattentive I "],["990","impatient and I'm not intentional I can "],["993.079","be very thoughtless so that puts "],["996.12","pressure on all the people who work with "],["998.279","me to be extra thoughtful and attentive "],["1001","to make up for my deficiencies so need "],["1004.12","to pray for all those people Elana has "],["1006.12","to be extra attentive the staff they all "],["1009","have to all the

"],["1018.88","get dropped now I do work on it I I've "],["1022.279","got certain things that I do apply "],["1023.88","myself to to make an effort to be good "],["1026.16","at the job preaching would be one of "],["1028.28","them uh leadership development "],["1031.24","networking with skilled people so I can "],["1033.6","hand them jobs to do I don't have to "],["1035.199","think about it anymore

"],["336.319","what's going on here in verse number 10 "],["337.84","through 12 we have an altar which from "],["340.6","those who serve the Tabernacle have no "],["342.6","right to eat for the bodies of those "],["344.68","animals whose blood is brought into the "],["346.199","sanctuary by the high priest for sin are "],["348.16","burned outside the camp therefore Jesus "],["351.12","also that he might sanctify the people "],["353.44","with his own blood suffered outside the "],["356.12","gate so the audience when they heard "],["358.08","that detail of of the bodies of the "],["360.6","animals whose blood is brought into the "],["362.16","sanctuary by the high priest for sin are "],["364.12","burned outside the gate they would "],["365.8","immediately think about their most high "],["368.52","holy day the day of atonement this was "],["373.08","according to Leviticus chapter 16 where "],["376.319","Moses wrote the blood of the goat the "],["378.759","bull and the Goat for the sin offering "],["381.319","whose blood was brought into the most "],["382.88","holy place to make atonement must be "],["384.96","taken outside the camp their hides flesh "],["388.16","and intestines are are to be burned up "],["391.44","so the remains of this animal sacrifice "],["393.479","on the day of atonement had to be taken "],["395.199","outside the camp and burned up so when "],["397.72","the author mentions this detail here of "],["400.52","the custom arol of his audience would "],["402.68","immediately recognize oh he's talking "],["405.08","about the day of atonement oh that's our "],["408","most high holy day this was the day when "],["410.88","the sins of the entire nation for that "],["413.44","year were atoned for the high priest "],["416.12","would go into the holy of holies with "],["417.919","the blood of the sacrifice and perform "],["419.96","the annual rituals that meant the sins "],["422.12","of the nation were covered for that year "],["424.28","it wasn't just that simple though the "],["425.879","high priest had to wear do these "],["428.199","elaborate Washings and wear these "],["430.039","specific clothes and there was also the "],["432.28","choosing of the Two Goats the one to be "],["434.4","sacrificed for the sins and then the "],["436.8","other the scapegoat the H high priest "],["440.24","would lay hands on and tie a scarlet "],["442.479","cord on its horn symbolizing the sins of "],["445.08","the nation are being placed on this goat "],["447.4","and then that goat would be led out of "],["449","the C Into the Wilderness and the "],["451.24","nation's sins it was conveying that the "],["453.4","nation's sins had been removed from the "],["456.599","camp on that little goat now here's a "],["459.08","fun fact that goat once it was taken "],["461.759","away U Into the Wilderness they couldn't "],["464.159","have it wander back a few days later "],["466.599","because then that would be like oh the "],["467.639","sins are back that's not good so the "],["469.639","person who let it away would then kick "],["473","it over a a cliff and it would die out "],["475.879","there in the "],["476.72","wilderness uh kind of interesting that "],["479.039","when you you remember the people of "],["480.8","Jesus Hometown Nazareth when he claimed "],["483.44","to be the Messiah they wanted to throw "],["486.639","him off a cliff H the day of atonement "],["490.12","was full of actions with symbolic "],["493.039","meaning it was very important to the "],["495.639","Jews and then the author connects it to "],["499.52","the death of Christ and he reminds the "],["501.36","people the symbolic customs of the Old "],["503.68","Testament were fulfilled in the finished "],["506.479","work of Jesus the bodies of the animals "],["509.599","whose blood were brought into the "],["511.8","sanctuary they're burned outside the "],["513.8","camp therefore Jesus also that he might "],["517.24","sanctify the people with his own blood "],["519.519","suffered outside of the gate Jesus was "],["522.839","taken outside of the city of Jerusalem "],["526.12","and he was sacrificed crucified there "],["529.2","for our sins on the day of atonement Two "],["532.64","Goats one was sacrificed and the other "],["535.16","was taken outside of the camp to carry "],["537.56","the sins of the people away and Jesus "],["539.72","fulfilled both actions when he was taken "],["542.32","outside of the city outside of the camp "],["544.92","and sacrificed for the sins of the world "],["548.36","so the author concludes in verse 13 let "],["551.36","us go forth to him outside of the camp "],["555.279","bearing his reproach let's turn to Jesus "],["558.92","now let's go out to him people he now is "],["562.48","the sacrifice he is the altar from which "],["566.399","we eat and we have this altar "],["569.8","which those who serve in the Tabernacle "],["571.8","have no right to eat so those who serve "],["574.12","in the Tabernacle are the religious "],["575.959","leaders of Israel who were trusting in "],["578.2","the old covenants the Old

in all of the Old Testament right "],["294","the nation of Israel worshiping false "],["296.08","gods listening to false prophets that "],["298.639","led them to curse es and destruction and "],["302.4","this concern is repeated over and over "],["304.84","and over in many of the letters to the "],["307.16","churches in the New Testament we see an "],["309.759","example of Paul who said

an angel of Light "],["323.68","so it is no surprise that his servants "],["325.56","also disguise themselves as Servants of "],["327.16","righteousness their end will correspond "],["329.56","to their deeds and Peter the Apostle "],["332.72","Peter said but false prophets will also "],["335.36","arise among people just as there will be "],["337.96","false prophets among you who will "],["340.84","secretly bring in destructive heresies "],["343.639","even denying the master who brought them "],["345.68","bringing upon themselves Swift "],["347.919","destruction so the Apostle

why does it "],["362.08","matter people's religion just Live and "],["366.16","Let Live it's all benign in the end "],["368.44","isn't it can't we just agree to disagree "],["371.88","just be respectful everybody's opinions "],["374.4","can't we all just coexist right coexist "],["378.599","that's it you know just you know Gaza "],["380.96","and Israel everybody simply agree to "],["382.8","coexist it would all be "],["384.96","fine what's the problem with that level "],["387.919","of oversimplification "],["390.56","well the problem is those values of "],["393.599","coexisting of loving your neighbor are "],["398.44","the words of Jesus Christ and the people "],["400.96","who believe in Jesus Christ will aspire "],["403.4","to obey them but none of the other "],["405.8","religions believe in Jesus and his "],["407.639","teachings their teachings maybe say the "],["410.919","opposite see the reason why coexist can "],["413.56","even be a slogan here in the west is "],["416.12","because we have a Christian Heritage and "],["419.639","one of the core values of our Christian "],["421.68","Heritage is love your enemies and do "],["425.16","good to those who do evil to you to "],["428.24","forgive but other religions and cultures "],["430.639","don't necessarily play by those rules "],["432.759","love your neighbor is not something that "],["434.68","just comes naturally we have thousands "],["437.199","of years of human history to prove this "],["439.759","people go to war and to the victors go "],["442","the spoils the conquerers use their "],["444.36","resources that they gained through "],["445.919","conquering to build their empire use the "],["448.96","ensl and the captives to build their "],["451.24","cities and their

them so coexist is never a thing "],["463.479","unless someone is prepared to deny "],["466.36","themselves and care about the needs of "],["468.4","others and that's a command that we are "],["471.12","given in the Bible Philippians chapter 2 "],["473.479","let nothing be done through selfish "],["475.159","ambition or conceit but with loneliness "],["477.36","of Mind esteem others better than "],["479.919","yourself and let Le look out not only "],["482.919","for his own interest but the interest of "],["486.56","others these precepts biblical precepts "],["490.199","lead to peace and life but other beliefs "],["493.8","lead to war and destruction James tells "],["497.199","us where do Wars and fights come from "],["499.319","among you do they not come from your "],["500.639","desires for pleasure that war in your "],["503.599","members you lust and you do not have you "],["505.96","murder and covet and you cannot obtain "],["508.12","you fight and War "],["510.56","so some actions lead to blessings and "],["514.08","other actions lead to curses some paths "],["516.919","lead to light and other paths lead to "],["519.12","destruction it matters what path you're "],["522.88","on if a certain path is leading to "],["525.24","curses and destructions I just can't sit "],["527.24","here and say oh oh that's fine you know "],["529.279","that's all good all paths are good no "],["531.6","they're not and to pretend or wishfully "],["535.44","think it's all good is a myth so Paul "],["540.16","says in 2 Timothy chapter 4 the time is "],["542.959","coming when people will not endure sound "],["546.079","teaching but having itchy ears they will "],["548.8","accumulate for themselves teachers to "],["551.519","suit their own passions and will turn "],["554.36","away from listening to the truth and "],["556.76","wander off into myth why would people "],["559.92","want to believe in myths because "],["562","according to Paul what the myth is "],["565","teaching suits their own Passions "],["570.36","now some people will say uh Christianity "],["572.36","is a myth here's a good litness test for "],["575.72","that to tell which belief system is a "],["580.279","myth does it suit the leaders the "],["583.92","adherence "],["585.519","passions does Christianity suit your "],["589.76","passions what are the personal benefits "],["591.92","of following Jesus he says deny yourself "],["595.519","don't feed your lust abstain from "],["597.48","worldly pleasures serve give "],["599.959","sacrificially forgive turn the other "],["602.839","cheek love those who hate you suffer "],["605.32","persecution even die for the sake of the "],["608.8","Gospel now on the other hand what would "],["611.079","be the

could take whatever we want we could "],["622.64","sleep with whoever we want we could "],["624.32","punish and hurt people that stand in our "],["625.839","way we could abort our babies and "],["627.399","euthanize the elderly and get rid of all "],["628.92","the needy demanding people steal kill "],["631.32","and destroy the strong rule the weak "],["635.48","that's what secular humanism teaches "],["638.8","Darwin promotes do what you "],["642","will well what about answering to God "],["644.279","well that's a scary concept now let's "],["646.88","let's just eliminate god let's get rid "],["648.6","of accountability if we have if we are "],["651.72","the gods then we get to decide what's "],["654.12","right and wrong many people are secular "],["656.88","humanists they believe in humanity so "],["659.8","which is the myth and which is "],["662.6","truth well we use our litness tests Paul "],["665.399","exposes the motivation behinds people's "],["667.2","beliefs is in the myth "],["669.76","is they want it to suit their own "],["672.639","passions it suits their own passions to "],["675.12","believe that and they turn away from "],["676.44","truth and wander in the "],["677.88","midst so that's important that's a "],["681.2","useful sniff test it's one piece of "],["684.24","evidence we can use it's not the total "],["685.68","body of evidence of how to know "],["687.2","something's a false teaching but that is "],["688.8","a good tool in your toolbox so let's see "],["692.2","if that tool works here in Hebrews just "],["694.959","so happens the author has a specific "],["697.519","false Doctrine in mind what is it "],["699.959","Hebrews chapter 13 verse number n again "],["702.44","don't get carried away strange in "],["703.639","various doctrines

every "],["851.92","day many times in need and sometimes "],["855.8","it's been me I've been out there in need "],["859.16","back when I had a motorcycle I was on "],["861.12","leville road and the bike died and I was "],["863.639","like uh oh open up my gas tank and I was "],["865.68","out of gas I said come on are you "],["867.32","kidding me such a idiot no sooner I "],["870.8","thought that

to help people "],["889.839","he drove "],["890.88","off I wasn't the angel that day I was "],["893.6","the child of God in need and God used "],["896.519","that dude to help me out back in 2004 il "],["900.399","on and I went to Boston to preview this "],["902.72","Seminary Gordon Cromwell we didn't have "],["904.68","a lot of money but the school had people "],["907.36","who were willing to let us stay in their "],["909.12","home for free for the preview weekend so "],["911.6","we stayed with this nice couple who we "],["913.16","never met before they just opened up "],["914.839","their home to us while we were in Boston "],["917.399","there was this huge rain and all of the "],["920.04","septic systems had all backed up and we "],["922.24","were driving around in this parking lot "],["925.12","and the whole drainage was backed up and "],["928.12","uh the Water was so deep it caused a "],["929.959","mechanical failure to our van sucked "],["932.72","water up into the air intake valve and "],["934.839","blah blah blah I don't know what else "],["936.56","that means but we were just stuck and "],["939.199","broke down in Boston so I got a towed "],["942.24","and of course nobody could look at it "],["943.759","that day we had to stay an extra day in "],["945.68","Boston and this couple who uh we were "],["948.8","staying with said no you can't stay with "],["951.279","us we only signed up for two days get "],["954.24","out no of course they didn't say that "],["957.319","they were so kind and understanding and "],["959.36","they said as long as you need to stay "],["961.199","you can stay here with us and we stayed "],["963.079","an extra night and found out the next "],["964.92","day that the car was going to think a "],["966.639","few days to fix and Atlanta's like Rob "],["968.48","we need to get out of here the kids are "],["970.279","back home and we can't stay here any "],["972.279","longer so we had to rent a car and drive "],["973.959","back to Canada but that couple their "],["976.8","Hospitality was huge we were in a bad "],["980.68","spot but they helped us out their love "],["983.24","for strangers was lifesaving for us at "],["986.519","that time my point is life is hard and "],["990.88","chaos is inevitable for everyone and God "],["994.519","says these are opportunities to show "],["996.68","people love on my behalf even "],["1001.399","especially "],["1003","strangers strangers can be God's "],["1006.16","children so just like King Jesus needed "],["1009.24","some help the night he was born all the "],["1011.759","rest of God's children out there they're "],["1015","going to need some help at some time too "],["1017.16","so in light of that "],["1019.56","we had five different Ministries "],["1022.079","communicate with us some needs here at "],["1024.28","the end of the year missions organ "],["1026.559","missionary organizations that we already "],["1028.48","support we who are out there ministering "],["1031.16","to strangers they said to us we have "],["1033.6","these extra needs we really could use "],["1035.48","some help with and since God has been so "],["1038.28","generous with us Faith Bible Church and "],["1040.76","since it is within our power to help the "],["1043.319","elders on your behalf decided to break "],["1046.559","the budget and show some love "],["1049","and last month we did an extra "],["1051.64","$35,000 worth of missionary special "],["1054.48","donations to help show love and share "],["1057.559","the gospel and I won't tell you about "],["1060.72","all of them but I did want to share this "],["1062.84","one because it ties into this passage "],["1065.88","Hebrews chap "],["1067.44","13:3 remember the prisoners as if "],["1070.76","chained with them those who are "],["1073.36","mistreated since you yourself are in the "],["1076.559","body also so so one of the missionary "],["1080","organizations that we support that we "],["1081.84","gave an extra gift to Good News prison "],["1084.559","Ministries is a uh organization that we "],["1088.24","have on our books uh Patrick our new uh "],["1091.559","missionary director and I had lunch with "],["1094.679","President uh John Evans and John shared "],["1097.159","with us this need at Christmas time "],["1099.64","inmates who have families often get "],["1102.08","Christmas gifts sent to them but inmates "],["1104.24","who have been forgotten or abandoned by "],["1106.159","families and friends get nothing and "],["1108.52","often that makes them feel very alone "],["1110.24","and unloved abandoned and depressed and "],["1113.2","even hostile to fellow prisoners who did "],["1116.36","receive a gift but good news prison "],["1118.64","Ministries came up with an idea just "],["1120.919","like the shoe boxes that we send out "],["1123","through Samaritan's Purse they found "],["1125.159","that by giving an inmate a Christmas "],["1127.039","gift creates a wonderful opportunity to "],["1129.679","share the gospel with them and at a time "],["1132.64","when these people are feeling very "],["1133.84","unloved by having a gift give to them it "],["1137.52","touches their hearts to let them know "],["1138.96","that God has not forgotten them so "],["1140.96","Patrick and I were like wow that's cool "],["1143.28","and then John said but wait there's more "],["1145.96","we actually have a donor who is doing a "],["1148.76","matching program for every dollar you "],["1151.159","give he's going to match it so that way "],["1153.12","we can do twice as many gifts and since "],["1156.2","we are supposed to have love for "],["1158.159","strangers and since we are to remember "],["1161.08","prisoners as if chained with them we "],["1163.919","thought let's give to this so we're "],["1167.24","trying to be faithful "],["1168.799","to these commands and show the love and "],["1171.24","thank you for your generosity and the "],["1174.039","trust that you've given the leadership "],["1175.52","of this church that we have the "],["1177.159","opportunity and we have the resources at "],["1179.52","our disposal to do these things because "],["1181.72","none of us could give $35,000 by "],["1183.88","ourselves but collectively we are able "],["1186.28","to do so many great things "],["1189.559","together but love for strangers is not "],["1192.52","just the missionary's job now is "],["1195.08","it no it is all of our job to show Phil "],["1198.76","oxos those people are strangers to us "],["1203.84","but not to God they are his children his "],["1208.36","creation and often I think of that one "],["1211.88","evening it was raining and this lady was "],["1214.559","off on the side of the road trying to "],["1216.52","change her tire and she had kids in the "],["1218.24","car and I I pulled over and said here "],["1221.159","let me and it's not really that I like "],["1223.84","getting wet and dirty and changing tires "],["1226.48","one of the reasons why I did that is I "],["1229.039","think well if it was my wife stuck on "],["1232.039","the side of the road with a flat tire at "],["1233.96","night in the rain I really hope some "],["1236.32","good guy would keep her safe and help "],["1239.919","her out if it was your daughter if it "],["1243.36","was your son who didn't have a place to "],["1245.039","spend the night you'd be very grateful "],["1247.36","that someone took the time to give them "],["1249.52","a hand well they're all God's children "],["1253.36","and I'm telling you he really "],["1255.36","appreciates it when you show them some "],["1257.76","love and give them some "],["1260.559","philoxenos now there are some reasons "],["1262.52","why we don't one would be like I said "],["1265.28","earlier the need for safety we are "],["1267.679","afraid that someone could be a dangerous "],["1269.159","person someone could be crazy we could "],["1270.76","be pulled into someone's drama and end "],["1273.12","up getting hurt that would no doubt be a "],["1276.12","legitimate concern and a very real "],["1278.279","possibility we have an expression we say "],["1280.36","around here a lot hurt people hurt "],["1284.08","people meaning if someone is dealing "],["1286.24","with crisis in trauma there going to be "],["1288.84","explosive and reactionary I've used this "],["1291.84","analogy imagine someone has second "],["1294.08","degree burns all over their skin and you "],["1296.72","reach out to try to help them or Comfort "],["1299.279","them or hug them but very the very Act "],["1301.559","of touching them is painful so they Yelp "],["1304.48","in pain and every time you try to touch "],["1307.12","them it hurts them and that's what "],["1309.48","people who are hurting are like they're "],["1312.4","hyper sensitive because of the trauma "],["1314.96","the past offenses the stress they're "],["1317.6","experience experiencing it's hard for "],["1319.679","them to trust or even receive love they "],["1323.72","might hurt you while you're trying to "],["1326.24","help "],["1327.6","them we can't be scared of that Jesus "],["1331.44","tells us perfect love casts out fear to "],["1336.72","be obedient to this command to show love "],["1338.88","to strangers you're going to have to "],["1340.2","overcome fear another reason why we "],["1342.4","don't want to practice love for "],["1344.32","strangers is we haven't organized "],["1346.76","ourselves in such a way that we've made "],["1348.679","intentional time to do so we've already "],["1351.52","put so much on our plate it would be "],["1353.64","inconvenient

who we're listening to "],["193.159","today back when I was um coaching high "],["196.72","school basketball in Canada I would say "],["198.879","to the team we're going to come in at "],["202.84","6:30 in the morning and we're going to "],["205.04","practice at that early three times a "],["207.319","week and then you're going to stick "],["208.64","around after school and practice in the "],["210.84","afternoon four days a week so we can get "],["212.76","ready for the season and the kids would "],["215.68","say okay and they do exactly what I told "],["220.159","them to do nobody ever complained or "],["222.12","questioned they would just show up and "],["223.72","do it later on in life I was able to "],["227.239","coach at the college level and the "],["229.36","college team I said to the players at "],["231.08","the beginning of the year we're going to "],["232.56","have this pre-season conditioning time "],["234.799","where we're going to do all this running "],["236.72","to get in shape and then we're going to "],["238.68","have afternoon practice races as well "],["240.959","and you guys are going to come together "],["242.04","we're going to work on basketball skills "],["243.799","and one guy said uh coach what if we "],["247.84","don't it's like don't what what if we "],["251.84","don't do the "],["254.159","conditioning never had that happen "],["256.56","before never had that level a straight "],["260.04","up challenge I want to be on the team I "],["263.04","just don't want to do the things you're "],["264.28","saying the team's going to do what will "],["267.6","happen so what motivates you to do the "],["271","things you don't feel like doing but you "],["273.479","know you're ought to do them now the "],["276.16","interesting thing about the two teams "],["277.6","the high school team it was a Christian "],["279.28","School in our church I uh was the youth "],["281.96","pastor at the time I did the coaching "],["283.96","because I loved it it was a great way to "],["285.36","connect with the teenagers a way to "],["287.16","build relationships but I didn't have to "],["289.68","do the coaching it would not have "],["291.56","affected my position as youth pastor "],["293.639","they didn't hire me to be a coach that "],["295.72","was just my own initiative but the kids "],["297.72","they really did want to be on the te "],["299.6","team it was pretty much the only thing "],["301.16","to do in that little school most of the "],["303.4","high school boys in the school were "],["304.68","actually on the team cuz there's only "],["305.84","like 15 kids and 12 of them were on the "],["307.32","team the camaraderie the fun you know "],["309.759","the away games eating at McDonald's you "],["311.88","know just we w a lot of games everybody "],["314","wanted to be on it so I could say to "],["316.24","those kids if you miss practice if you "],["319.16","don't come to the morning practice you "],["320.8","won't be on the team and they would say "],["322.919","no I'll be there please don't kick me "],["325.28","off the "],["326.12","team college team was different wasn't a "],["329.16","big deal to be on the team there was "],["331.039","very little interest in sports in the "],["333.199","student body it was all I could do to "],["335.88","scr up 12 players who actually wanted to "],["339.319","be on the team so you didn't actually "],["341.44","have to be any good there was no Tri "],["343.759","outs there was no Cuts I just had extra "],["346.44","uniforms and I threw them on whoever "],["348.28","showed up to "],["349.96","practice and "],["352.56","uh that was the "],["354.68","deal but uh the thing with that team is "],["358.479","uh I coached Sports for the sports "],["362.039","department at the college and they in "],["364.919","exchange gave me "],["367.52","some housing I had an oncampus apartment "],["371.12","and I needed that housing otherwise we'd "],["372.72","have been like living in Northern "],["374.199","Virginia with my in-laws which we didn't "],["375.68","want to do or living in a van down by "],["379.28","the river so here was my challenge I "],["382.12","needed the team more than they needed me "],["385.12","and the young fellow who asked me the "],["386.479","question what if we don't coach he was "],["388.919","the best player on the team so I really "],["391.199","needed him to stick with it and this was "],["394.12","a leadership challenge how do I motivate "],["396.319","people to follow me especially when it's "],["398.199","things that they don't want to do so I "],["400.759","could have drawn a hard line you don't "],["402.68","condition you won't play but what if he "],["404.52","said fine whatever I don't care and I "],["406.039","don't want to play I could have lost the "],["408.039","whole team I could have lost the season "],["410.12","I could have lost my "],["411.44","housing so instead of taking a hard "],["414.12","stance you know no conditioning you "],["416.28","can't be on the team rather I spun the "],["418.56","big pitcher "],["419.919","well I says if we don't condition then "],["423.639","we will be in poor shape and we will get "],["427.039","beat by other teams who are in better "],["428.8","shape and we will be big losers and that "],["431.84","will stink and he said huh that's true "],["435.039","and so he conceded to participate in the "],["437.639","conditioning and I passed that "],["439.919","leadership challenge and it was a "],["442.24","question I never forgot what if we don't "],["446","because it is a good question so many "],["449.56","folks have done military service been in "],["452.24","the military you get an order and if you "],["455.479","said to your commanding officer uh sir "],["457.4","what if we don't what would "],["460.599","happen every military service member "],["463.199","takes an oath to obey orders from the "],["465.479","president of the United States and the "],["467.24","officers that are appointed over them "],["469.28","and This Promise is not merely a "],["470.759","formality rather it is the Cornerstone "],["473.28","of military discipline so what happens "],["476.039","if a service member fails to uphold the "],["478.24","oath and disobeys a direct order well "],["480.72","article 92 criminalizes the failure to "],["484.039","obey lawful orders or regulations "],["486.199","punishment can range from simple "],["488.36","reprimands to forfeiture of pay to "],["491.24","confinement up to two years or "],["493.759","dishonorable discharge so it's clearly "],["497.12","stated you can lose your rank you can "],["498.52","lose your pay you can be in prison you "],["499.919","can get dishonorably discharged in the "],["502.479","business World here's your assignment do "],["505.039","your job uh boss what if I don't well "],["507.639","that's simple you're fire "],["510.08","you get no "],["511.2","paycheck if you're leading the military "],["514","or in a work setting you have these "],["516.24","strong consequences to motivate people "],["518.76","to do as you say even teachers in school "],["521.36","you don't get this done you'll fail "],["523.44","you'll fail the class but

"],["1683.519","literally you can see these distinct "],["1685.48","changes between the various "],["1687.12","dispensations particular covenants in "],["1689.039","different ones so Mount Si versus

uh is defined as "],["1722.76","an assembly or called out ones the root "],["1726.08","meaning of church is not building it's "],["1729.919","what people now we say this is the "],["1732.519","church

"],["1740.88","you people are the "],["1742.76","church the body of Christ made up of all "],["1746.64","the Believers Jesus of course is the the "],["1750.039","head and we are all the body and uh "],["1753.399","since the day of Pentecost in Acts all "],["1756.6","the way until Jesus returns everybody "],["1759.72","who believes in Jesus is in the church "],["1763.64","so we regard the church uh in two ways "],["1767.72","the universal which I just described and "],["1770.88","then also we have the local so The "],["1773.44","Universal Church consists of everyone "],["1775.72","everywhere who has a personal "],["1777.24","relationship with Jesus at all times uh "],["1779.84","Paul summarized it this way we are all "],["1781.559","baptized by one Spirit into one body Jew "],["1784.84","Greek slave or free male or female we're "],["1787","all one in Christ and we've all been "],["1788.919","given one Spirit to drink this verse "],["1791.76","says that anyone who

"],["1802.24","Church that's what he's talking about "],["1804.279","here the assembly the church now the "],["1807.76","local church when you go through the "],["1810.799","Epistles uh like in Galatians where Paul "],["1813.519","says Paul an apostle all my brothers "],["1815.76","with me to the churches in galatia will "],["1819.48","hear what he's talking about is the the "],["1822.32","province of galatia there's many local "],["1825.12","churches localized Ministries scattered "],["1827.799","throughout that Province so you know "],["1830.399","like we have in our

church "],["1843.519","the universal church but as we meet "],["1846.399","together we are a local church a local "],["1849.64","Fellowship of Believers so the universal "],["1852.399","church is comprised of everyone "],["1853.72","belonging to Jesus members of The "],["1855.519","Universal Church should seek Fellowship "],["1857.919","to be edified in a local church where "],["1860.919","you're meeting with other brothers and "],["1862","sisters of Christ and that's what Jesus "],["1863.799","invites us to the church on "],["1866.36","Earth is all part of the kingdom of God "],["1869.919","it's all part of "],["1871.799","Zion so here Faith Bible Church we are "],["1875.48","attempting to build the kingdom of God "],["1878.559","the church here in St Mary's County

"],["1898.799","we've been working on you know probably "],["1901.159","you've never done this but uh some of "],["1904","you have ever jumped in the car and got "],["1906.36","on 95 north and drove all the way to the "],["1910.6","end of it about an hour and a half "],["1913.2","before you get to the Canadian border "],["1915.44","you look to your left and you see this "],["1917.559","big

"],["1926.72","Mountain Mount Kaden is the highest "],["1928.919","mountain in the state of Maine it's "],["1931.039","5,269 feet high there's no mountain in "],["1933.72","the state of Maryland

"],["1951.88","Mount kadad to this day still the "],["1954.08","biggest mountain I've ever climbed you "],["1956.24","start in you know in the woods drive "],["1958.279","your car up as far as you can go and "],["1959.799","then you get out and you start in the "],["1961.24","woods hiking just on a trail it's you "],["1963.399","can tell it we're going uphill it's it's "],["1965.12","gradual but then the path gets steeper "],["1968","and as it gets steeper you notice the "],["1969.76","top soil gets less and the plant life "],["1972","diminishes and the trees just get "],["1973.48","smaller and smaller and more sparse and "],["1976.08","the higher you go the rockier the trail "],["1978.6","gets by the end of it all you're doing "],["1980.559","is just climbing over huge rocks trying "],["1983","to get to that very high point and then "],["1986.12","you turn around you look behind you at "],["1989.36","everything in the forest is all in the "],["1991.799","distance and the great state of Maine is "],["1994.36","all stretched out beneath you and you "],["1996.6","feel great and small all at the same "],["2000.519","time great because you're standing up so "],["2002.88","high and looking over the world like "],["2005.2","you've never seen it before and small in "],["2008.2","comparison to the mountain and the "],["2010.519","landscape how vast it is it's definitely "],["2013.24","a huge accomplishment anybody ever climb "],["2014.799","a mountain it's kind of a huge "],["2016.08","accomplishment to get up there and look "],["2017.919","around now when I became a youth pastor "],["2020.559","at the People's Church in tro Nova "],["2022.039","Scotia I remembered how I felt as a "],["2023.639","teenager and Elana and I said well let's "],["2026.32","take the youth group uh to Maine to "],["2029.32","climb this mountain but the difference "],["2031.399","was is this was actually would take us "],["2032.76","three days because we had to drive 7even "],["2034.88","hours to get to Maine and we spent spent "],["2037.159","the night and then we get up in the "],["2038.48","morning and we climbed the mountain "],["2040.279","ascended and descended in one day and "],["2043.279","then we're totally exhausted and just "],["2045.72","passed out at a campsite so here's a fun "],["2048.48","thing this campsite uh you know they had "],["2051.119","showers and the shower would give you uh "],["2054.96","five minutes for a quarter you get hot "],["2057.24","water for five minutes so uh we got back "],["2059.879","to that campsite and I went up to Iana "],["2061.96","and I said I have this great gift for "],["2063.48","you and I gave her a dollars worth of "],["2065.32","quarters and she was like oh thank you "],["2067.359","so much she went in there and soaked as "],["2069.48","long as she could uh to recover from "],["2071.8","that mountain climbing and then we had "],["2073.079","to try the next day seven uh hours to "],["2075.96","get back home it was exhausting but we "],["2078.919","did it one time we did it so like many "],["2081.52","years later like maybe seven eight years "],["2083.119","later after we moved down here to "],["2084.24","Maryland we went back on one of our "],["2085.879","trips to Nova Scotia visiting our old "],["2088.079","church visiting our old friends and "],["2089.96","during

made some speeches most of the "],["49.199","on campus student body was there the "],["51.96","president The Faculty was an intendance "],["54.28","it was a full house and then after all "],["57.199","the formalities we the ball team was to "],["60.12","play a game against another College in "],["61.559","our conference and there I was in the "],["63.48","middle of it all on the team

well sums up my "],["108.759","entire college basketball career as "],["112.36","often as I went to the gym and I looked "],["114.04","at those retired numbers and thought "],["115.439","about that

"],["126.399","accomplish any athletic Feats that would "],["128.56","earn someone those honors nobody was "],["131.4","ever going to cheer or celebrate me due "],["135.84","to my lack of skill and

someone prays in their "],["366.96","heart at the end of a sermon and nobody "],["368.759","knows anything about "],["370.199","it or so you "],["373.479","think someday if you're interested I "],["376.72","would recommend you go watch the Terry "],["378.72","Fox story write that down the Terry Fox "],["381.88","story it's on YouTube you can see it "],["383.88","there for free I'm going to summarize "],["386.039","this true story for you Terry Fox was a "],["389.96","young Canadian fow who came down with "],["392.24","cancer in his late teens and lost his "],["395.52","leg like many young guys he was big in "],["399.199","the sports and losing his leg serly dis "],["401.68","severely disrupted his life activities "],["404","and his self-image he got this "],["405.96","prosthetic leg and he began to cope with "],["408.52","life but then he got this crazy idea at "],["411.319","the age of 22 any 22 year olds in here "],["413.72","today anybody 22 this morning all right "],["417.52","close oh Garrett 22 this is for you "],["420.16","Garrett at 22 years of age he decided "],["423.52","this would be crazy this would be "],["424.68","Garrett would do this actually he "],["426","decided to run across the country Coast "],["429.12","to Coast to raise money to find a cure "],["431.8","for cancer now as you all know the "],["434.96","country of Canada is two things huge "],["439.96","and cold right and running all the way "],["443.36","across it is nothing anyone has ever "],["445.319","wanted to do and the biggest challenge "],["447.24","of that goal is completing the run "],["448.919","before the winter because when the "],["450.759","winter comes you're dead just you're "],["453.319","going to die doing that but Terry "],["455.72","believed he could do it his plan was to "],["458.44","run 26 miles every day until he'd run "],["463.199","from east to west coast a marathon a day "],["467.919","that's what he set out to do on April "],["469.84","19th 1980 in Cape Spear St John's "],["473.72","Newland Terry stuck his prosthetic foot "],["477.039","in the Atlantic Ocean and and he set out "],["481.039","on his marathon of Hope now he was in "],["486.199","Newland and uh only his small team "],["489.52","witnessed him start because I mean it's "],["491.759","Newland and there's not a lot of people "],["493.879","there and nobody in Canada really cares "],["496.28","what's going on in Newland but uh you "],["498.919","know he was going to run through all 10 "],["501.28","provinces so he had to start with "],["502.479","Newland local news covered the story as "],["504.919","a human interest piece but for the most "],["506.759","part he ran through newf land without "],["508.72","anyone "],["509.8","even noticing but the funny thing "],["512.039","happened the further he got every day he "],["515.36","finished the more people heard about his "],["518.24","goal every Community he ran through "],["520.32","heard his story and so after a while in "],["524.2","the beginning people were skeptical but "],["526.56","they were paying attention and then he "],["529","ran through all the Maritime Provinces "],["531.2","Nova Scotia Prince Edward Island by the "],["533.399","time he got to New Brunswick this was "],["535.399","really starting to grow people were "],["538.12","really starting to figure this out he "],["539.92","came to our little town and our small "],["542.279","school uh he did a school assembly for "],["544.64","all of the kids and they all came out to "],["547.44","meet him and hear his vision and of "],["549.72","course our little town paper made it a "],["551.76","front page story and at 9 years old I "],["554.6","remember my sister telling me about the "],["556.959","guy that came to the school with one leg "],["559.12","who was running across Canada to raise "],["560.959","money to find a cure for cancer everyone "],["563.76","in our community was talking about Terry "],["565.64","Fox so the marathon of Hope started to "],["568.88","be come a thing "],["571.36","but what's the next Province after New "],["574.399","Brunswick mother Quebec he got to Quebec "],["578.16","the French Province and especially in "],["581.04","the 80s the quebeckers were big on the "],["585.04","idea of separating from the rest of "],["586.279","Canada and they just paid little "],["588.399","attention to what us anglophones us "],["590.92","English-speaking part of the country "],["592.76","were doing so Terry's running through "],["595.12","Quebec and no one knows what he's doing "],["598.12","and he gets no support support and this "],["599.76","is a very large Province by the way this "],["601.279","is one of the most wealthiest ones and "],["604","matter of fact not only did they not "],["605.44","support him they tried to run him off "],["606.56","the road people were like swerving into "],["608.399","him and forcing him into the ditches it "],["610.6","was very frustrating to grind out all "],["612.92","those miles and raise no support for his "],["615.519","efforts however once he got through "],["617.399","Quebec he got "],["618.72","into "],["620.32","Ontario four months now into his "],["622.68","Marathon he's been running for four "],["624.68","months he gets to Ontario and then that "],["627.12","hits the national media because everyone "],["628.76","cares about Ontario and everyone was "],["631.279","hearing about this young man who lost "],["632.56","his light to cancer instead of giving up "],["634.16","on life he was committing to this "],["636.44","Marathon to run across the nation on one "],["639.12","leg to raise money to find a cure for "],["640.8","cancer people begin to join him people "],["643.44","begin to run with him you know like "],["644.68","Forest gum right they all just started "],["646.24","to Goot there and run with him because "],["648.8","people with family members who were "],["650.68","fighting to survive cancer saw Terry and "],["653.24","his Marathon as he's running for my "],["655.8","loved ones he he's he's running to save "],["659.12","their lives and the whole nation watched "],["662.24","as he ran through the streets of Toronto "],["664.92","it was a big inspiration of course "],["667","everyone gave him a big parade at that "],["668.72","time he was like a superum being running "],["672.079","26 miles every "],["675.399","day but the thing about running on a "],["677.519","prosthetic leg when you're recovering "],["679.12","from cancer is it extracts a huge toll "],["681.959","on your "],["682.88","body and Halfway Around The Great Lakes "],["685.48","in Ontario Lake Superior Kevin after "],["689.399","running for 143 days logging "],["692.88","3,339 "],["694.44","miles his body gave out he never "],["697.839","completed the marathon the cancer "],["700.32","returned and he died raised $1.7 million "],["705.12","for cancer research but the cancer "],["708.36","killed "],["711.24","him however the thing about a martyr is "],["714.639","this they're very inspirational and "],["717.76","instead of letting that dream die "],["720","Canadians decided we need to finish "],["723.92","Terry's Marathon for him so one year "],["728.12","when he after he ended that race 300,000 "],["731.92","people did the one day Terry Fox run and "],["736.48","raise $3.5 million for cancer research "],["740.16","and they did it again the next year and "],["741.959","they did it again the next year and it "],["744.36","has been 43 years every year there's the "],["748.959","annual Terry Fox marathon of Hope which "],["752.04","has raised over "],["753.959","$850 million for cancer research in "],["758.04","Terry Fox's name and you're thinking wow "],["763.48","that's a really inspirational story "],["765.839","Pastor Rob I see why you got all teary "],["768.56","eyed and why Terry Fox is such a "],["771.079","national hero for you "],["773.279","Canadians what does that have to do with "],["775.48","us well just like Terry Fox's run "],["779.6","which started with very little interest "],["781.92","our marathon of Faith starts "],["785.079","seemingly very insignificant nobody "],["787.76","knows and who really cares and also just "],["791.519","like Terry's run our marathon of faith "],["794.079","is filled with times of excitement and "],["796.279","positivity front page coverage spiritual "],["798.639","victories but there are also times of "],["800.8","great discouragement where people are "],["802.92","literally trying to run you off the road "],["805.68","and destroy your faith and such is the "],["808.88","case for the folks in Hebrews 12 the "],["812.72","audience is in the middle of Quebec and "],["816.16","the people are trying to run them over "],["818.88","as they seek to believe in Jesus the "],["820.56","Messiah and follow his way

"],["468.84","non-biblical rules I Stripped Away the "],["471.419","legalism dare I say I promoted a spirit "],["473.88","of joy of fun into an otherwise cranky "],["478.62","contentious environment after all I was "],["481.38","Aaron's age and we were a lot alike look "],["484.44","our pastor who actually wears sports "],["486.24","clothes and do-rags and plays basketball "],["488.58","in the yard with the kids listens to "],["491.16","forbidden music "],["493.8","we went to did camps and work projects "],["496.68","with the teens and they wanted to do "],["498.78","these things they wanted to be a part of "],["500.4","it not out of obligation and the entire "],["502.8","attitude around the church "],["504.72","lightened up and once I got into the "],["507.539","pulpit and was preaching every Sunday I "],["509.46","wasn't bullying or badgering or guilting "],["511.86","the people it was more just explaining "],["513.599","the biblical principles and illustrating "],["515.339","them through stories and you know bit of "],["517.86","humor "],["519.36","so Ross's two is youngest fellas had a "],["523.32","completely different Church experience "],["524.82","that his four older children "],["526.86","but the biggest difference was really in "],["529.26","Ross himself "],["530.519","when his oldest he went to his oldest "],["532.92","son and he said what did I do wrong "],["536.58","and Andrew was honest with his dad he "],["538.92","says dial back the control let the "],["542.459","younger boys have some fun "],["544.68","so Ross listened and he changed his "],["549.839","parenting style the younger fellows came "],["552","up through the sports programs that we "],["553.62","built at the school and their High "],["554.88","School experience was full of good times "],["556.98","with friends in a community who cheered "],["559.56","for them as opposed to judging them for "],["561.899","everything "],["563.16","the first four struggle with their "],["564.899","relationship with God the last two boys "],["567.48","they became pastors "],["569.22","and they're serving the lord Faithfully "],["571.26","full time they are young men devoted to "],["574.2","the faith "],["576.12","a few months back I was watching the "],["578.58","live stream at my old church "],["581.339","sometimes I just do that I just go and "],["583.5","check out their website and see who I "],["586.44","can see and listen to Pastor Ken "],["588.779","Fillmore and it was Mother's Day and so "],["592.32","they were "],["593.339","having all the mothers come up front and "],["595.2","they were getting plants I thought this "],["596.82","is very interesting though I can see "],["598.5","actually see the people as they come up "],["600.12","and I Saw Linda go up and get a plant "],["602.519","and thought about Linda and Ross and all "],["605.04","that history and and then "],["607.26","I saw right behind her their youngest "],["609.6","daughter Amber she went up and she got a "],["612.779","plant and I thought wasn't that nice "],["614.22","because you know that was one of Ross's "],["616.68","prodigal children she made it back to "],["619.08","church and back to the faith "],["621.06","and then I saw on the Facebook friends "],["624.18","of mine uh first of August Ross was uh "],["627.959","78 years old and he passed on "],["630.66","and uh my thought was well you know "],["633.779","had a reunion with his son who died 30 "],["636.54","years ago "],["638.04","and so now that was kind of a nice "],["639.779","thought these people from my past they "],["642.18","they taught me many things and I want to "],["644.519","help you learn these lessons from this "],["647.7","time and these folks today we look at "],["650.579","first Samuel and we see children who are "],["654.72","raised in the same spiritual environment "],["657.019","but two completely different outcomes "],["660.48","two of these young fellows have no faith "],["662.459","at all but one "],["663.899","tremendous tremendous faith lots of us "],["667.32","can relate to it this because many here "],["669.779","have children who are all raised in the "],["672.3","same home but turned out very different "],["675.24","some practice faith and others rejected "],["678.779","and as parents one of those outcomes "],["680.519","would make us very sad but the other "],["682.019","would make us very proud "],["684.779","so we see here in first Samuel "],["687.72","chapter 3 "],["690.06","we get into the story of first Samuel "],["692.459","and uh "],["694.92","it says Samuel the boy Samuel ministered "],["697.98","to the Lord before Eli "],["700.14","and the word of the Lord was rare in "],["702.48","those days "],["703.8","there was no widespread revelation "],["707.16","now I just I had to stop right there "],["710.64","um because that really jumped out at me "],["712.74","and I had to ask the question I wonder "],["715.26","why "],["716.339","I wonder why the word of the Lord and "],["719.399","Revelation was so rare "],["721.92","well you think about it in this "],["723.779","historical setting this era of judges "],["728.88","the reoccurring theme was every man "],["731.76","did what seemed right in his own eyes "],["733.56","the high priest the nation's spiritual "],["735.899","leader at that time is Eli so we're "],["738.3","going to look at Eli for a minute the "],["740.279","last judge uh who'd been judging the "],["743.1","nation for 20 years in this timeline is "],["745.92","Samson you remember Samson the guy who "],["747.959","preferred to hang out in the Philistine "],["749.22","cities and drink and sleep with "],["750.779","prostitutes any battles that he won was "],["753.899","not the nation coming together unifying "],["756.3","under the word of the Lord spoken to "],["758.22","Samson no he he was just doing what "],["760.62","seemed best to himself in that moment "],["763.139","just like everyone else at that time and "],["765.06","Eli we're going to see he he was leading "],["767.22","the formal religious practices he was "],["769.86","maintaining the system and it appeared "],["773.82","to be good on the outside but what was "],["775.5","going on internally in his home was a "],["777.959","mess so we got to read that in first "],["780.12","Samuel chapter 2 verse 22. and this is "],["783.72","so we kind of get the context of what "],["786.36","we're going to learn in chapter three so "],["787.92","Eli it says verse chapter 2 verse 22 "],["790.74","he's very old and he heard everything "],["793.26","his sons did to all of Israel "],["796.2","how they lay with the women who assemble "],["799.079","at the door of the Tabernacle meeting "],["802.019","so he said to them why do you do such "],["804","things I hear of your evil dealings from "],["807.18","all the people no my sons it is not a "],["809.76","good report that I hear you make the "],["811.98","Lord's people transgress "],["813.899","if a man sins against another God will "],["816.36","judge him but if a man sins against the "],["818.82","Lord who will intercede for him "],["820.98","nevertheless they did not heed the voice "],["823.38","of their father because the Lord desired "],["827.399","to kill them "],["829.68","and the child Samuel grew in stature and "],["833.459","in favor both with the Lord and with men "],["836.339","so in contrast to evil to the sons of "],["839.459","Eli who are offending the people and the "],["841.86","Lord's going to punish them quite "],["843.06","severely Samuel this little guy is "],["845.399","growing up just like Eli's sons did but "],["849.12","he has favor with God and with men Eli's "],["853.5","sons who were serving as priests in the "],["855.18","temple in the Tabernacle they're using "],["857.399","their position of power for their "],["858.66","personal gain they're using their "],["860.16","influence to take advantage of people "],["861.54","they were into stealing manipulating and "],["864.24","uh even getting some of the women to "],["865.92","engage in these immoral activities they "],["868.74","do what seems right in their own eyes "],["870.54","but because they are priests and "],["873.36","supposed to be representatives of God "],["875.22","they're defiling and corrupting the "],["877.86","people's worship experience "],["880.5","well that's a reoccurring theme in the "],["882.3","Bible the religious leaders defiling and "],["884.399","corrupting the nation's religious "],["885.839","practices what an Insidious plan of the "],["889.74","devil the place and the event that is "],["892.56","supposed to help you gain freedom from "],["894.54","sins and bring you closer to God is "],["897","actually corrupted and has now become a "],["899.339","place where people are getting defiled "],["901.019","and offended thus driving them farther "],["904.079","from God "],["905.519","and that is something that still goes on "],["907.88","that never has changed people in here "],["911.639","have been spiritually abused manipulated "],["915.3","offended by religious institutions this "],["919.139","has wounded them deeply and made them "],["920.76","very skeptical of any religious "],["923.16","institution and as a pastor often I pay "],["926.04","for the sins of someone else's former "],["928.32","Pastor someone else's wrong doing some "],["931.38","other spiritual leaders horrible actions "],["933.36","and people project their hurt and "],["936.18","distrust onto me and onto US "],["939.06","just like when someone's divorced and "],["941.16","their next relationship they get into "],["942.72","often they're already defensive and "],["944.76","skeptical I'm not going to put up with "],["946.74","that behavior I I won't go through that "],["948.779","pain again so the moment the new "],["950.639","romantic interest does anything that "],["952.26","remotely resembles the previous spouse "],["954.06","they says Ah I said I'm out of here "],["956.76","no that makes sense because once you've "],["959.399","been wounded you're hypersensitive "],["962.1","the enemy of our souls he loves this "],["964.079","tactic the New Testament authors were "],["966","already warning the churches watch out "],["968.76","for wolves and sheep's clothing people "],["970.38","who will get into the church and into "],["972.12","the congregation and and use and abuse "],["974.519","the Sheep hurt and wound and destroyed "],["976.74","the church from within and so many "],["979.5","people have gone through this Eli the "],["982.74","high priest wasn't doing that but he was "],["986.04","allowing it to happen because he was "],["987.66","letting his sons away with it Israel's "],["991.26","leadership Sampson Eli both not "],["994.44","listening to the laws of God "],["997.86","so here's the thing about God's speaking "],["1001.279","and widespread Revelation as we see in "],["1004.759","chapter 3 verse 1 where it says the word "],["1006.5","of Lord was rare and there was no "],["1008.42","widespread revelation "],["1012.019","it's not happening "],["1014.54","because nobody's listening "],["1017.72","remember the verse I quoted last week "],["1020.42","from Second Chronicles chapter 16 where "],["1022.639","it says the eyes of the Lord run to and "],["1025.28","fro over the whole earth to show himself "],["1028.4","strong on behalf of the heart who is "],["1030.98","loyal to him "],["1033.079","let us marry that Revelation that God "],["1036.199","says he's always looking let's marry "],["1038.179","that with this other verse that tells us "],["1040.28","something about God's nature Malachi "],["1042.62","chapter 3 verse 6 God says I am the Lord "],["1045.799","I change not and this is what "],["1050.059","theologians call the immutable nature "],["1053.059","the unchanging nature of God it's "],["1055.64","important that fact that God is "],["1057.679","unchanging because it assures us that "],["1059.66","God's not going to change his mind and "],["1061.4","contradict himself the things that he "],["1063.62","has spoken the promises he made the "],["1065.96","covenants he's established 3000 years "],["1068.059","ago those are still in effect today God "],["1071.24","doesn't change and so since God doesn't "],["1073.58","change and God says his eyes are always "],["1076.4","looking "],["1077.72","was he doing that in the period of the "],["1080.059","judges "],["1081.559","well yes "],["1083.9","so what's he seeing "],["1086.12","he's seeing everyone doing what seems "],["1087.98","right in their own eyes no one with a "],["1090.679","heart devoted to him "],["1093.919","question is he still looking now "],["1096.5","well if he's unchangeable then the "],["1098.059","answer is yes "],["1100.58","does he "],["1101.96","still want to prove himself strong "],["1104.66","yes so what does he see when he looks at "],["1108.2","us "],["1109.46","what would it take for some widespread "],["1113.059","revelation "],["1114.2","what would it take to be supernaturally "],["1116.72","empowered in God to show his strength "],["1119.48","here with us "],["1121.4","I suppose it would take us being "],["1125.36","willing to live righteously and think "],["1127.58","and act in a manner that when God looks "],["1129.74","at us what he sees is like yeah yeah "],["1131.66","those folks in Saint Mary's County that "],["1134.38","they could be a place there there's a "],["1137.12","people there's a church that I could "],["1138.919","illustrate my power in "],["1141.44","one of the things it would look like "],["1143.84","would be people "],["1145.7","well not doing what seems right in their "],["1147.2","own eyes "],["1148.1","it would be people not merely focused on "],["1150.32","their own needs but "],["1151.88","their own wants and desires but rather "],["1153.5","they would be people concerned with the "],["1156.02","needs of others "],["1157.7","caring about

"],["1495.799","so Samuel went and lie down in his place "],["1499.039","now the Lord came and stood and called "],["1501.44","as the other times Samuel Samuel Samuel "],["1505.1","answered "],["1506.6","speak your servant hears "],["1510.559","the Lord said to Samuel "],["1512.419","behold I will do something in Israel at "],["1515.72","which both ears of everyone who hears it "],["1518.36","will tingle in that day I will perform "],["1520.64","against Eli all that I've spoken "],["1522.5","concerning his house from beginning to "],["1524.179","end for I have told him that I will "],["1526.76","judge his house forever for the iniquity "],["1528.559","which he knows because his sons made "],["1530.96","themselves vile and he did not restrain "],["1533.24","them "],["1534.32","and therefore I have sworn to the house "],["1536.299","of Eli that the iniquity Eli's house "],["1538.34","shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or "],["1540.38","offering forever "],["1543.2","Sammy laid down until morning "],["1545.36","open the doors of the house of the Lord "],["1547.039","Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision "],["1549.62","he like called the Samuel and said "],["1551.179","Samuel my son he said here I am "],["1553.76","he said what is the word that the Lord "],["1555.5","spoke to you please do not hide it from "],["1557.179","me God do to you and more so if you hide "],["1560.48","anything from me of all the things that "],["1562.46","he said to you see he already knew "],["1564.559","because the previous he had a Prophet "],["1566.96","come to him and tell him there was going "],["1568.1","to be bad things coming because of his "],["1569.36","sons "],["1570.08","so he expects it's going to be bad "],["1572.539","yeah Verse 18 Samuel told him everything "],["1574.76","and he hid nothing from him and he said "],["1576.559","it is the Lord "],["1577.82","let him do what seems good to him "],["1581.24","so Samuel grew and the Lord was with him "],["1583.76","and let none of his words fall to the "],["1585.799","ground and all Israel from Dan to "],["1588.26","Bathsheba knew that Samuel had been "],["1591.38","established as a

"],["1600.14","the word of Samuel came to all Israel "],["1605.24","so what is very interesting In this "],["1607.46","passage is the Lord is speaking to this "],["1609.62","little child Samuel "],["1611.179","now even though Eli "],["1614.179","is doing a horrible job managing his "],["1616.22","grown sons he does deserve I think a "],["1619.22","little bit of credit here for "],["1620.24","recognizing when God is speaking and "],["1622.46","understanding how to properly "],["1624.46","acknowledge it this little fella Samuel "],["1627.74","God's calling him he doesn't

"],["1046.64","binge watching reels on social media for "],["1049.64","happy evening "],["1051.32","another part of why David is called a "],["1053.059","man after God's Own Heart is because he

"],["1095.48","Saul's like all right well the Lord be "],["1097.58","with you good luck kid "],["1099.5","David was fully aware that God was in "],["1101.6","control of his life and he had faith "],["1104.12","that he would be delivered out of this "],["1106.22","impending danger how else would you "],["1107.9","venture into a potentially fatal "],["1109.82","situation with such calm and

it pleased God "],["1125.6","and God rewards him "],["1128.24","and that's why all these wonderful "],["1129.86","things God does for him so at this point "],["1132.559","in the book of Hebrews that's what's "],["1135.26","been going on that's what the author's "],["1137.059","been trying to convince us to live by "],["1138.799","faith in the Son of God after all we too "],["1141.74","are going to

"],["282.74","Samson chooses to disobey God and break "],["285.72","the Nazarite vow now we believe "],["288","according to what the Bible tells us "],["289.74","that God has plans and purposes for

that he has a "],["305.82","plan for your life we ought to find out "],["308.639","what his will is but so often people run "],["311.46","around trying to to please themself they "],["313.86","just

"],["324.78","you cheat you steal to get what you want "],["326.22","and it leads to bitterness Envy fighting "],["329.58","and even Wars but God has a better way "],["333.539","God has better things

we're going to see this especially "],["346.02","with Samson "],["347.22","God can have a plan and a vision but he "],["349.62","doesn't force it upon you he gives us "],["352.259","Free Will and we must choose to trust "],["355.44","him and follow him which requires a "],["358.38","letting go of Pride and a yielding our "],["360.78","free will to his "],["363.72","so we see the Samson's calling

"],["430.8","Egyptian records they were not just an "],["432.9","invading Army but with them was women "],["435.36","and children so it was a wholesale "],["438.24","migration event thus we could tell

"],["734.22","the woman bore a son called his name "],["736.32","Samson the child grew and the Lord "],["739.26","blessed him "],["740.76","all right so let's get into Samson's "],["742.98","action Chapter 14 verse 1. "],["745.8","Samson went down to timna saw a woman in "],["748.98","timna of the daughters of the "],["750.48","Philistines so he went up and told his "],["752.64","father and his mother he said I have "],["754.079","seen a woman in timna of the daughters "],["756.779","of the Philistines now therefore get her "],["758.579","for me as a wife "],["760.68","his father and mother said is there no "],["763.019","woman amongst the daughters of our "],["764.76","Brethren or amongst all my people that "],["767.1","you might go and get a wife from the "],["769.26","uncircumcised Philistines Sansa said to "],["771.66","his father get her for me she pleases me "],["774.36","well "],["775.92","but his father mother did not know that "],["779.16","it was "],["780.24","of the Lord "],["782.1","that the Lord was seeking an occasion to "],["784.92","move against the Philistines for at "],["788.1","that time the Philistines had dominion "],["790.2","over Israel Saul Sampson went down to "],["792.24","timna with his father and his mother and "],["793.98","came to the vineyard of timna now to his "],["796.079","surprise a young lion came roaring out "],["798.36","against them and the spirit of the Lord "],["800.339","came mightily upon him and he tore the "],["802.2","line apart as one would tore apart a "],["804.42","young goat though he had nothing in his "],["806.76","hand "],["807.42","but he didn't tell his father and his "],["808.86","mother what he'd done "],["810.779","then he went down and he talked to the "],["812.279","woman he please she pleased Samson well "],["814.139","after some time he returned to her "],["816.3","returned along "],["818.22","side to see the carcass of the lion and "],["820.8","behold the swarm of bees and honey were "],["823.139","in the carcass of the lion so he took it "],["824.94","in his hand and he went along eating "],["826.5","when he came to his father's mother he "],["828.66","gave some to them and they ate also but "],["831.12","he didn't tell them that he'd taken the "],["833.16","honey out of the carcass of the Lion "],["835.98","so right away we see Samson has some "],["839.639","character flaws he breaks the law of God "],["842.779","Israel was not to intermarry with "],["845.16","foreign Nations because those people had "],["847.44","false gods and it would cause the nation "],["849","of Israel to fall away from the Lord "],["850.26","their God which is exactly what it has "],["852.66","caused the oppression in the first place "],["854.1","because of their Disobedience against

"],["875.88","often the case Even in our foolishness "],["878.579","and Disobedience God can be at work he "],["882.36","says in verse number four "],["884.699","his father and his mother did not know "],["886.62","that it was of the Lord that he was the "],["889.92","Lord he was seeking an occasion to move "],["892.5","against the Philistines "],["894.66","now we have the first display of "],["897.12","Samson's super human strength that the "],["899.94","Lord had given him in verse five and six "],["902.22","with the law income roaring out these "],["904.68","Asiatic lions that used to inhabit this "],["907.68","region were estimated to be 350 to 450 "],["911.94","pounds they know this because they have "],["914.04","some in captivity that didn't go extinct "],["915.839","and that's what they grow to 350 450 "],["918.66","pounds three to four feet in height went "],["920.94","on all fours so they're just on all four "],["923.22","standing up here to you and uh the Kings "],["926.699","back in that time they loved to capture "],["928.8","these lions and keep them around to kind "],["930.36","of flex on everybody and show look how "],["932.1","powerful we are we get these powerful "],["933.54","beasts and they would even use them for "],["935.22","execution as we saw in the story of "],["938.16","Daniel and the Lion's Den where they "],["940.139","were throwing the uh the convicted "],["942.42","criminals to the Lions to destroy them "],["945.72","and that was a very effective way to "],["947.519","kill prisoners no man unarmed by himself "],["950.279","could fight a lion and win Sam said "],["952.92","easily tears it in two with his bare "],["956.1","hands "],["957.18","so Samson's traveling back and forth "],["959.22","according this Philistine girl on one of "],["961.92","his trips he's checking in on this lion "],["963.54","car because ah I killed a lion over here "],["965.16","let's go over and check this out and he "],["967.019","sees that bees have made a hive and "],["970.079","honey in the carcass not Honey in the "],["972.66","Rock Mike honey in the carcass maybe no "],["974.76","I'll leave that alone "],["976.019","and so he gets some out and he eats it "],["978.36","and that was a "],["979.8","violation of his Nazarite bow because he "],["982.38","touched an unclean thing "],["984.54","anyways he goes down to the Philistine "],["986.399","region they're having a big Feast with "],["988.62","his new in-laws they're celebrating his "],["990.18","wedding it's a seven-day feast and "],["992.1","there's 30 Philistine fellows there and "],["994.74","you know he decides hey I got 30 guys "],["996.66","here let me mess with them let me strike "],["1000.079","up a wager with them verse 12 chapter "],["1002.959","14. "],["1004.639","Samson said to them let me pose a riddle "],["1006.92","to you and if you can correctly solve "],["1008.48","and explain it to me within seven days "],["1010.339","of the feast I'll give you 30 Linens of "],["1013.22","garments and 30 changes of clothes but "],["1015.5","if you cannot explain it to me then you "],["1017.42","will give me 30 lens of garments 30 "],["1019.399","changes to close it's gonna restock the "],["1022.16","Wardrobe "],["1023.199","and they said to him well pose your "],["1025.52","riddle that we may hear it so he says to "],["1026.9","them out of the eater came something to "],["1028.699","eat "],["1029.54","out of the strong came something sweet "],["1033.199","now there for three days they could not "],["1035.6","explain the riddle but it came to pass "],["1037.699","on the seventh day they came to Samson's "],["1039.98","wife "],["1041","entice your husband that he'll explain "],["1042.919","the riddle to us or else we will burn "],["1045.5","you and your father's house with fire "],["1048.38","what else would you burn with I don't "],["1049.88","know but we'll burn it with fire have "],["1051.38","you invited us in order to take what is "],["1054.02","ours is that not so "],["1057.2","Samson's wife wept on him and said you "],["1060.08","only hate me you "],["1063.86","sons of my people but you have not "],["1065.419","expect "],["1068.299","well I would explain it to you oh he "],["1070.82","needs marriage counseling right there "],["1072.02","right like "],["1073.16","this is not going well "],["1077.179","now she wept for seven days while the "],["1080.6","feastings last that's just so awkward "],["1082.4","isn't it right having this big party for "],["1084.5","seven days and she's just in the room "],["1086","crying the whole time messing up the "],["1088.76","whole vibe "],["1090.08","so finally he explains the riddle to her "],["1094.66","and then she explains the riddle to the "],["1097.64","sons of her people "],["1098.9","so the men of the city said to him on "],["1101.419","the seventh day when the sun went down "],["1103.82","what is sweeter than honey "],["1106.039","what is stronger than a lion "],["1108.14","and he said "],["1109.52","if you're not plowed with my heifer I "],["1111.26","would not have solved you wouldn't "],["1112.28","solved my riddle "],["1113.9","and I'm never gonna touch that I'm just "],["1115.7","going to leave that alone "],["1117.559","it's just some Hebrew idiom that I'm not "],["1119.6","going to get into "],["1121.28","Spirit of the Lord came upon Him "],["1123.26","mightily and he went down to Ashkelon "],["1126.62","killed 30 of their man took their "],["1129.26","apparel gave the changes of clothing to "],["1131.96","those who had explained the riddle so he "],["1134.24","was anger and aroused he went back to "],["1136.58","his father's house "],["1138.5","that Samson's wife was given to His "],["1140.6","companion who had been his best man "],["1143.539","so we observe how brutal the Philistines "],["1145.76","are they'd soon to burn their own "],["1147.02","countryman's house down then lose their "],["1149.6","wager but we also see Samson as equally "],["1152.179","as vindictive he goes to a Philistine "],["1154.22","City kills 30 dudes to get their clothes "],["1156.26","to cover his payment and this begins a "],["1159.86","back and forth between Samson and the "],["1161.9","Philistines San Diego expanded and angry "],["1164.36","and then retaliates the Philistines "],["1167.66","control over the region is threatened by "],["1169.52","this guy so he's on their Most Wanted "],["1171.679","lift and they try to take him out "],["1174.799","now I should point out as we look into "],["1176.9","Samson's battles with the Philistines "],["1178.52","never once do we see him as a military "],["1180.919","leader he never once tries to Rally the "],["1184.34","nation of Israel to defeat the "],["1185.66","Philistines he's not trying to help or "],["1188.059","serve his people he never once asked God "],["1190.94","for help everything he does with his "],["1193.28","great power is purely for himself "],["1196.76","and this is probably a good time to "],["1198.62","point out that despite what Spider-Man "],["1201.559","teaches us "],["1203.36","with great power comes great "],["1204.86","responsibility "],["1206.539","Samson does not feel any need to live "],["1210.5","responsibly he seems to feel like he's "],["1213.679","Above the Law of God "],["1215.419","and about the average person's concerns "],["1218.12","of suffering consequences for actions he "],["1221","only uses his power to entertain himself "],["1223.76","after he kills the 30 men he goes back "],["1226.58","to Israel why he's away his "],["1228.74","father-in-law gives his wife to his best "],["1231.26","man and that of course offends Samson "],["1233.539","once again chapter 15 verse 3 which "],["1236.179","probably tells you that his best man was "],["1237.74","a Philistine but anyway Samson uh "],["1240.26","chapter 15 verse 3 finds out that uh his "],["1243.919","wife has been given away and that makes "],["1245.48","him mad and he says this time I shall be "],["1247.94","blameless regarding the Philistines if I "],["1249.799","harm them 15 4 Samson went out and he "],["1252.86","caught 300 foxes took torches turned the "],["1255.86","Fox's tail to tail put the torch between "],["1257.72","the pair of the Tails set the torch on

it's Justified verse six "],["1289.46","they said who's done this and the answer "],["1291.5","that was Samson the son-in-law of the "],["1293.84","Tim Knight because he gave his wife "],["1296.96","and giving her to took his wife and gave "],["1299.12","it to another companion so the "],["1300.799","Philistines came up and burned her and "],["1303.32","her father's house with fire "],["1306.26","so there you go burn them all to death "],["1308.96","the whole trying to get revenge "],["1311.84","mentality this philosophy always leads "],["1315.559","to destruction violence

when "],["89.04","ahood was dead children of Israel again "],["91.38","did evil in the sight of the Lord so "],["93","Lord sowed them in the hand of jabing "],["94.56","king of Canaan who reigned in

freshman year in "],["110.7","college introduction to the Old "],["111.96","Testament introduction New Testament we "],["113.579","would do a three-word summary of every "],["115.74","book in the

"],["124.2","Lord the Lord Souls him into the hand of "],["125.939","some enemy today it's jabin uh king of "],["128.88","Canaan and then we see Cicero who's the "],["131.52","commander of his army "],["133.5","and the children of Israel then cried "],["135.599","out to the Lord because David has 900 "],["138","Chariots of iron 20 years he harshly "],["140.4","oppresses the children of Israel so "],["141.78","there's this the cycle and then God "],["144.66","speaks to Deborah Deborah A prophetess "],["147.78","the wife of love "],["151.099","the was judging Israel at the time and "],["154.5","she would sit under the palm tree of "],["156.9","Deborah between Rama and Bethel in the "],["159.84","mountain of Ephraim and the children of "],["161.58","Israel came to her for

"],["203.58","really start with Deborah the prophetess "],["205.019","the prophetess is no different than a "],["206.879","prophet the word of the Lord comes to "],["208.379","Deborah God speaks to and through "],["210.48","Deborah and because of this Deborah is a "],["214.14","judge which is the top position of "],["217.2","leadership in the land she is elevated "],["219.239","to this position I think because God "],["221.76","speaks through her now Deborah is the "],["224.76","only female judge in all of Israel's "],["228.299","history so let's put the entire story in "],["231.36","the proper historical context there was "],["233.76","roughly three to four hundred years of "],["235.799","Old Testament history that is called the "],["237.9","time of the judges Deborah's "],["240.12","administration's vote in the middle of "],["241.56","that about 200 years after Joshua who "],["244.98","was given the leadership from Moses "],["246.92","Joshua they conquered the land and then "],["249.84","we go through this Jewish sin cycle for "],["252.12","200 years now we have Deborah and it's "],["254.939","about another 120 years before Samuel "],["257.88","the prophet priest and judge who Begins "],["260.639","the the king era the era of the Kings of "],["264.12","Israel but so that's where we are now "],["266.52","under Joshua "],["268.32","we have a United Nation everyone's "],["272.34","living together in one big Camp everyone "],["274.74","is literally close to the Tabernacle and "],["277.5","thus close to God in their hearts and in "],["279.9","their minds so think about the uh older "],["283.44","small towns that you might drive through "],["285.6","in America the old downtown areas the "],["289.08","most striking buildings in these areas "],["291","is always the "],["292.8","the old churches right they're built "],["294.96","right on the Main Street at the center "],["296.759","of town and usually they were very high "],["299.52","some of the highest buildings and this "],["301.68","communicates something about the people "],["303.419","back then when they built them and the "],["305.88","way their Community uh had the way they "],["308.4","had oriented their lives "],["310.44","what does it say "],["312.419","it says at the center of our community "],["314.04","what our lives revolve around is our "],["317.52","house of worship we want they everybody "],["320.16","wanted to be within walking distance of "],["322.62","their Church much of their Community "],["324.3","Life happened at the church times of "],["326.4","worship you know during the week you "],["328.199","know your Sunday services but then other "],["330.06","services and then other important family "],["332.46","events all your marriages uh your "],["334.68","receptions your special programs your "],["336.479","holiday traditions and of course your "],["339.3","funerals "],["340.56","all of these important Milestones that "],["342.9","one reaches would be hosted at the "],["344.759","church so if you're sitting in a church "],["348","with your entire family and your "],["350.46","extended community and it's where you're "],["352.44","learning your morals and dogmas together "],["354.18","you have a very United culture "],["357.479","the power of the closeness to your house "],["359.639","of worship and the interaction within "],["361.8","your community creates interdependence "],["363.72","and accountability one to another but "],["367.32","think about "],["368.699","American history and the culture as "],["371.28","communities grew people transitioned out "],["373.74","of the downtowns into the suburbs and "],["376.86","these developments were neighborhoods "],["378.72","that you access by your cars in the "],["381.78","Greek car automobile Revolution right so "],["384.539","uh people who lived in these "],["386.4","neighborhoods but they drove out of them "],["388.259","to go to work to go to school buses "],["391.08","picked up the kids and then to go "],["393.12","shopping there were strip malls built "],["395.46","near the communities but not directly in "],["397.74","the housing developments churches "],["399.539","likewise were built in proximity to the "],["401.699","neighborhoods but no longer at the "],["403.68","center "],["404.699","that these people in these communities "],["406.199","don't have the same uh "],["408.419","sense of accountability interdependence "],["410.46","there everybody's much more independent "],["412.02","they have their cars and the freedom of "],["415.139","the open road and they get in their cars "],["417.479","and they head to the highway and then "],["419.34","they decide oh where do I want to go "],["421.08","today "],["421.86","well we could go to church we'd go to "],["423.6","the mall we could go to the beach or we "],["425.34","could go to the movies there's no church "],["427.74","in our community that the people are all "],["429.72","expecting to see me at I don't depend on "],["432.18","these neighbors to support my business "],["433.62","or teach my kids or provide me services "],["436.639","and all are living very independent "],["440.18","lives that's exactly what happened to "],["443.28","Israel once the tribes got their "],["445.68","portions of land once they broke camp "],["447.96","and moved away from the Tabernacle and "],["450","spread out there's this newfound freedom "],["452.94","and Independence you have to go to the "],["455.639","Tabernacle a couple times a year for the "],["457.5","festivals but on the day-to-day God is "],["461.22","out of sight and thus "],["463.68","out of Minds so what happens well the "],["466.979","people who followed Joshua they made "],["468.78","their pledges to serve the Lord and they "],["471.66","did fine but 40 years later you have a "],["474.599","new generation who doesn't know Joshua "],["477.06","they didn't see the walls of Jericho "],["478.38","come tumbling down they didn't "],["479.759","experience all the great victories they "],["481.56","just heard about it it's stories just "],["483.84","like we tell these stories now uh in our "],["486.599","Bible studies and to our children uh "],["489.24","that's what they had they recited the "],["490.979","law of Moses just like we do to one "],["492.84","another but aside from your personal "],["495.78","commitment level what exactly do I do to "],["500.52","make you believe and really be faithful "],["502.74","to the Lord our God "],["505.56","what can I do if you don't show up for a "],["507.72","month or two what can I do if someone "],["509.46","decides to stop attending church "],["511.02","altogether "],["512.039","what can I do if other things become a "],["514.919","higher priority to you or just sleeping "],["517.08","in on Sunday feels like what you want to "],["518.7","do in all honesty "],["521.58","not much at all right we don't we don't "],["523.8","have a Paddy Wagon where we drive around "],["525.6","and throw you all in it "],["528","not much to do I can't personally do "],["529.98","anything about what you decide to do all "],["532.86","I really have authority over is my own "],["536.279","house and that's what Joshua charged the "],["539.04","people with when they broke camp and "],["541.08","went out he said choose this day who "],["543","you'll serve whether it's the gods of "],["545.459","the ammonites across the river or the "],["546.959","gods of these people you got to choose "],["548.94","but as for me at my house we will "],["551.339","serve the Lord and this is the "],["554.7","individual responsibility of each and "],["556.8","every person all have to decide for "],["559.56","themselves if they will be faithful to "],["561.42","the Lord you have to look at your own "],["563.399","heart and you have to govern yourself "],["566.339","but bear in mind ideas have consequences "],["570.72","if you choose to walk away if you choose "],["573.839","to disengage and detach there are "],["576.54","consequences because everyone influences "],["580.14","someone you being here your faithfulness "],["583.44","and commitment can influence someone "],["585.24","else to be here word of mouth is still "],["588.18","the best means of promoting Faith Bible "],["590.519","Church sorry Hannah I know the website's "],["592.68","good but uh are the signs really cool "],["595.26","but still it is the relationships that "],["597.959","we have with people that influence "],["600","people to come you telling someone I "],["602.76","attend this church and why and what God "],["605.16","has done to you God will use that to "],["607.8","speak to someone especially where "],["609.48","they're in some hardships that when "],["612.24","they're going through a dark time they "],["614.22","they will think about God and they will "],["615.839","think about your church because you "],["617.82","testified that it was an important "],["619.56","source of peace and hope in your life "],["622.38","in a dark world we are a light on a hill "],["627.56","shining for folks in need and we have "],["631.38","been able to throw some light on some "],["633.48","real shady subjects haven't we here at "],["636.899","Faith Bible Church we have

"],["657","well "],["658.5","there's one less light "],["660.48","and the people you would have influenced "],["662.1","well they're not coming and then if "],["663.72","seven eight or nine people make the same "],["665.339","choice we just got dimmer and dimmer and "],["668.339","what is the impact "],["670.44","the darkness grows in the absence of "],["672.42","Lights "],["673.44","and every year things in our land get a "],["677.579","little darker and a little darker until "],["679.98","you have what Israel is experiencing "],["682.32","they do evil in the sight of the Lord

"],["1526.76","and they reported to Cicero that Barack "],["1529.34","the son of a bin no aim was gone up to "],["1532.88","Mount Tabor so Cicero gathered together "],["1535.7","all of his chariots 900 Chariots of iron "],["1538.039","and all the people who were with him "],["1539.48","from Harrow Chef hey going to the river "],["1543.44","kishan then Deborah said to Barrick up "],["1547.1","for

"],["1657.919","show you the man you're seeking and went "],["1660.02","in into her tent and their lives are "],["1662.299","dead with the peg in his Temple "],["1665.98","crazy end of that story huh Deborah "],["1669.26","prophesies that a woman would get the "],["1670.94","glory not Barack and we think we're we "],["1673.46","assume I must be talking about herself "],["1675.08","but no she's talking about JL before we "],["1678.14","get into that fun detail let's observe "],["1681.08","the battle so one of the details here is "],["1683.059","there's only two tribes mentioned in the "],["1684.5","battle there's "],["1685.58","who Zebulon and Napoli and they are not "],["1689.9","the big strong tribes of Judah and "],["1692.059","Ephraim now these are the little minor "],["1694.279","Northern tribes and only two of them "],["1696.32","even though the entire nation is being "],["1697.58","oppressed by the Canaanites only two "],["1699.32","tribes are rallied to fight this battle "],["1701.539","and I think this coincides with the "],["1704.299","theme God uses the weak to conquer the "],["1708.32","strong "],["1709.159","cicera's Advantage is his chariots "],["1711.62","they're fast and they're deadly on the "],["1713.9","open but maybe not as effective on a "],["1716.48","different terrain so Barack starts on "],["1719.12","the Mount Tabor so he's where High "],["1722.36","Ground that's always best to have isn't "],["1724.64","it it's harder to battle uphill easier "],["1727.34","to descend and attack down as opposed to "],["1730.1","trying to race uphill but sister out is "],["1733.22","arrogance he doesn't matter he thinks "],["1734.779","he's tough he rushes to confront him the "],["1737.96","text doesn't give us a lot of details "],["1739.4","but I assume the terrain is what "],["1741.5","immobilizes the Chariots you know you "],["1743.36","have 900 chariots and let's say you got "],["1745.46","200 or two soldiers per Chariot that "],["1748.4","means you're gonna have like what 1800 "],["1749.84","men and you're running around in these "],["1752","things slashing everybody out but if the "],["1754.039","Chariots have lost their speed and "],["1755.779","Mobility due to the Mountainside and "],["1757.4","also the River Tree because he said that "],["1758.96","this is going to be at a river "],["1760.7","how many men does Barack have "],["1763.34","he's got ten thousand right so he's got "],["1765.26","them outnumbered so now ciceros his guys "],["1767.96","Panic they're getting destroyed and "],["1769.88","Cicero he abandons his troop he leaves "],["1772.279","his Chariot and he flees by foot which "],["1774.2","makes no sense at all to do because "],["1775.7","obviously chariots are faster than "],["1777.2","running on foot unless your chariot has "],["1779.419","been immobilized and sister realizes "],["1782","he's going to be overrun before he can "],["1784.039","get his Chariot up and

he wants to make you "],["577.14","to be "],["578.339","all right let's summarize the story of "],["580.08","Gideon verse 16. "],["583.92","the Lord said to him surely I will be "],["587.1","with you and you shall defeat the "],["589.2","midianites as one man "],["592.68","now this is very important "],["594.6","what do You observe "],["598.44","the angel of the Lord says "],["601.56","I will be with you "],["604.019","so "],["605.279","that made my ears perk up and I'm "],["607.019","thinking this could be another "],["608.24","pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus Christ "],["610.8","the Old Testament we learned about this "],["613.26","before the term angel of the Lord can "],["615.779","simply be a Angelic

it says the angel of the "],["630.54","Lord appeared to him "],["632.519","getting replied if the Lord's with me "],["634.44","where where has he been "],["636.36","and then verse 14 "],["638.459",". look what it says the Lord turned to "],["640.98","him and said go in this might of yours "],["644.279","and you shall save Israel from the hand "],["646.98","of the midnights have I not sent you and "],["650.459","verse 16 the Lord said to him surely I "],["653.04","will be with you and you'll defeat the "],["655.019","midianites as one person "],["657","so instead of the Angel of the Lord "],["658.68","saying God is sending you God will be "],["661.68","with you he declares "],["664.2","I'm sending you and I will be with you "],["667.5","now notice Gideon's response in verse "],["669.54","17. he said if you now I have found "],["673.38","favor in your sight then show me a sign "],["676.38","that it is you who talk with me "],["680.64","it is you who talk with me what does "],["683.1","that imply "],["685.14","Gideon perceives that who he's talking "],["687.72","to is more than just some guy "],["691.14","and then Gideon asked him for a sign "],["693.06","interesting who else has Gideon heard of "],["696.12","who gives signs "],["699.12","like he said in verse 13 if the Lord's "],["701.64","with us where are the Lord's Miracles "],["703.44","this is a very Jewish

"],["719.7","wonders and Miracle after Miracle after "],["722.579","Miracle the Jews always look for the "],["726.12","signs and Paul even stated that the Jews "],["728.88","seek a sign he says and

that the truth "],["739.68","some people want signs other people want "],["741.959","like the Greeks explanations and "],["744.54","rationale but Paul says we stick with "],["748.5","the facts of the

"],["760.019","is a very deep Long elaborate rationale "],["762.54","behind why Christ was crucified and Mr "],["765.42","Neville is going to talk about that "],["766.68","today a little bit we could

"],["807.899","of signs in this story but his request "],["810.48","is not a lack of faith it's not seen as "],["813.24","that actually it seems to me that Gideon "],["815.339","is quick to perceive that this could "],["817.32","very well be the Lord he said verse 17 "],["820.38","if now I have found favor in your sight "],["822.6","then show me a sign that I know it is "],["824.88","you whose

"],["835.26","back so Gideon went Ian prepared a young "],["837.36","goat leavened bread he thought of flower "],["840.42","the meat he put in a basket "],["842.639","and he brought in a pot and he brought "],["845.04","it out to him under the tree and "],["847.26","presented it to him "],["850.019","observe that this offering of food is "],["853.86","giving in a time of scarcity people "],["857.16","barely have anything they can scrape "],["858.6","together to eat and yet Gideon brings an "],["860.76","offering that is a sacrifice for him to "],["863.459","give "],["864.24","and I want you to think about that for a "],["866.279","moment "],["867.959","often when people are asking God to "],["870.3","prove himself to them what they ask for "],["873.24","is "],["874.92","for God to give them something "],["877.8","God do this for me and then I will trust "],["881.04","you "],["882.18","is that really a sincere request God if "],["885.779","you're real send me some money if

would he do it "],["906.48","for me "],["907.44","he wouldn't listen to any other "],["909.06","reasoning that was the sign he required "],["913.26","in order to put his faith in Jesus "],["915.66","but that's not what faith is now is it "],["920.04","because faith is the evidence of things "],["923.16","hoped for the knowledge of things not "],["926.699","seen and I tried to tell him that God "],["928.74","would give him eternal life in the hope "],["930.36","of the Resurrection from the dead but "],["931.68","that wasn't what he wanted "],["933.36","listen to me now "],["935.399","God has great things that he will give "],["937.74","you but he's not a genie that grants "],["941.399","Wishes the point of faith is to trust "],["944.94","the Creator "],["946.92","that he knows what's best and asking God "],["949.92","to prove himself to you by giving you "],["952.199","what you want is manipulation and God's "],["956.16","not interested in entering into a "],["958.26","dysfunctional manipulative relationship "],["960.66","with you that is Satan's gain not God's "],["963.36","remember Satan's tempting offer that he "],["966.24","made to

"],["978.54","strings attached but God doesn't offer "],["981.18","that he says believe in me trust me "],["984.24","follow me Gideon gives an offering to "],["987.779","God "],["989.22","and then God gives him a sign "],["991.32","what was the sign "],["993.42","well "],["994.5","says here "],["996.24","brings it out verse 20 the angel of the "],["998.519","Lord said to him take the meat and the "],["1000.259","11 bread and lay them on the Rock pour "],["1002.54","out the broth and he did so and the "],["1004.04","angel of the Lord put out the end of the "],["1005.36","staff that was in his hand and touched "],["1007.639","the meat and the unleavened bread and "],["1009.5","fire rose up from the Rock and consume "],["1011.3","the meat and the unleavened bread and "],["1012.74","the angel

a bit "],["1027.26","of a waste right these are hungry people "],["1028.699","they don't have a lot of food to eat and "],["1030.02","then they give you some food and then "],["1031.04","you just light it on fire why would he "],["1032.299","do that well that's because he's showing "],["1034.52","Gideon that he is God "],["1037.52","he you have to consider Gideon's "],["1039.86","Heritage for a moment you have to think "],["1041.66","about what we know and what is taught in "],["1044.12","the laws of Moses the Hebrew word for "],["1046.339","burnt offering actually literally means "],["1048.74","to ascend literally to go up and smoke "],["1051.38","the smoke from the sacrifice ascends to "],["1054.26","God Leviticus 1 9 says as a soothing "],["1056.96","Aroma to the Lord technically any "],["1059.9","offering burned over an altar is a burnt "],["1061.94","offering but in the more specific terms "],["1064.16","a burnt offering was the complete "],["1065.78","destruction of the animal in an effort "],["1068","to renew the relationship between holy "],["1070.039","God and sinful man "],["1071.72","with the development of the law God gave "],["1074.12","the Israelites Specific Instructions as "],["1075.74","to what types of burnt offerings they "],["1077.179","and what they symbolized all the temple "],["1079.76","sacrifices were consumed on the altar "],["1082.1","burnt up and the smoke Rises to Heaven a "],["1085.28","person could give a burnt offering at "],["1086.539","any time it was a sacrifice of General "],["1089.9","atonement and acknowledgment of the sin "],["1092.299","nature and the request of a renewed "],["1094.94","relationship with God that's what it "],["1096.38","meant if the angel of the

fire and this sign "],["1110.78","means that God is renewing his "],["1113","relationship with Gideon because that's "],["1114.919","what the bird offerings meant and this "],["1117.26","is the first step from going from "],["1119.78","weakness to strength a sacrifice is made "],["1123.5","that restores the relationship between "],["1126.14","the frail dying person and the almighty "],["1128.84","Eternal God and that's what Gideon's "],["1131.66","sacrifice was "],["1133.46","now what was exactly what specifically "],["1135.44","was he offering there says "],["1138.86","what do you say "],["1141.2","a young goat "],["1143.12","is that familiar a goat do you use goats "],["1145.7","for sacrifices when we talk about the uh "],["1148.7","the sacrifices in the Passover in Exodus "],["1151.4","we always say uh "],["1153.679","a sheep right a lamb but "],["1156.86","let's read closer Exodus chapter 12 says "],["1160.76","now the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in "],["1162.679","the land of Egypt speak to the "],["1163.76","congregation of Israel saying one tenth "],["1165.38","of the month they shall each take a lamb "],["1167.96","to themselves according to

the "],["1178.28","goats right so that is consistent with "],["1183.26","the sign that we see in Exodus Numbers "],["1185.72","Chapter 7 read that entire chapter it "],["1189.08","records the people bringing offerings to "],["1190.88","the Lord and what there is to bring and "],["1192.679","over and over again it repeats that a "],["1194.96","male goat is offered as a sin offering a "],["1197.419","male goat for the sin offering now what "],["1200.72","is our sin offering "],["1202.28","what is the sacrifice that restores "],["1204.1","relationship between us and almighty God "],["1206.96","Eternal God it is of course the Lamb of "],["1209.84","God Jesus Christ once again quoting Paul "],["1213.039","we preach Christ crucified "],["1217.58","now see if I was a Prosperity Gospel "],["1220.22","preacher if I was a grifter "],["1222.5","oh to get your money I would have said "],["1224.419","you bring a sacrifice to God and he will "],["1228.02","bless you and the

"],["1249.26","given here it's an atonement sacrifice "],["1251.78","and the scripture there is pointing us "],["1254.6","to "],["1255.62","Jesus the atonement for our sins "],["1259.4","next thing God tells Gideon to do "],["1262.4","after he does this sacrifice "],["1264.82","verse 25. "],["1267.919","now it came to pass the same night the "],["1269.78","Lord said to him take your father's "],["1271.4","young bold and take end the second bowl "],["1273.86","of the seventh year old and tear down "],["1276.02","the altar of Baal that your father has "],["1278.539","and cut down the wooden image that is "],["1281.059","beside it and build an altar to the Lord "],["1283.28","your

"],["1292.76","cut down that's kind of fun right like "],["1295.22","he takes his dad's Idol chops it up and "],["1297.679","uses it as firewood to make a sacrifice "],["1299.84","to God so Gideon took 10 men from among "],["1302.84","the servants and did as the Lord said to "],["1305.36","him to do but because he's fearful to "],["1308.84","his father's household and the men of "],["1310.159","the city "],["1311.419","too much to do it in the day so he did "],["1314.36","it by night he's kind of scared to do "],["1317.419","this but he does it anyways in the just "],["1320.419","the cover of night "],["1322.1","and in doing so Gideon takes the second "],["1324.559","step towards becoming a mighty man of "],["1327.38","Valor Step One is receive Jesus the "],["1331.28","sacrifice for your sins and when your "],["1333.38","sins are atoned for it restores your "],["1335.96","relationship with God and step two "],["1339.2","tear down the false gods the

"],["1491.24","the weights "],["1492.86","that was encumbering me "],["1494.9","was when I was younger basketball not a "],["1498.679","sin but it was a weight coaching "],["1501.38","basketball the

"],["1509.659","slapped the label on me coach "],["1511.82","that's what I am I'm a coach life moved "],["1514.82","on and a couple other titles got a "],["1516.32","couple more labels stick on there

"],["284.82","who exactly are these enemies that need "],["287.28","drowning well let's start with the faith "],["289.32","of Moses and see what we can learn from "],["292.02","the Red Sea and then maybe we can find "],["294.66","some applications for you today so "],["297.24","Exodus chapter 14 "],["300.419","and we're going to look at this chapter "],["302.34","starting uh verse 1 through 12 then "],["305.04","we'll stop make some observations and "],["306.419","get to the rest of it so "],["310.44","the Lord spoke to Moses saying tell the "],["313.68","sons of Israel to turn back now this is "],["315.54","after they've come out of uh remember we "],["317.1","got them out of the land last week they "],["319.139","had the Passover and they were like get "],["321.6","out of here take your people and get out "],["323.46","of here is what Pharaoh said so now "],["325.259","they're they're traveling they're "],["326.4","leaving and they're they're getting out "],["328.08","of uh uh out of Egypt but then uh the "],["331.979","Lord says tell the Israel to turn back "],["333.72","to the camp at pith Hannah Roth "],["337.139","between Mig doll and the Sea and you "],["340.62","will

"],["360.18","Egyptians will know that I am the Lord "],["362.18","and they did so "],["364.86","when the king of Egypt was told that the "],["367.199","people who fled pharaoh and his servants "],["368.759","had a change of heart towards the people "],["370.62","and they said what is this that we have "],["372.9","done that we have let Israel go from "],["375.78","serving us so he made his

the Lord hardened the "],["386.22","heart of pharaoh king of Egypt and he "],["388.979","chased after the sons of Israel as the "],["390.9","sons of Israel were going out boldly "],["392.58","then the

"],["400.8","pith Hannah Roth in front of bail zafon "],["404.819","Esther Drew near the sons of Israel "],["406.74","looked and behold the Egyptians were "],["408.06","marching after them they became very "],["409.56","frightened so the sons of Israel cried "],["411.78","out to the Lord and they said to Moses "],["413.34","is it because there were no graves in "],["415.44","Egypt that you have

"],["430.86","okay so a couple of observations In this "],["433.08","passage I I really kind of thought this "],["437.1","was interesting where God said in verse "],["438.66","4 I will be honored

to face "],["484.259","a hard challenge so that he can show you "],["486.979","a great response verse number eight the "],["490.919","Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king "],["492.66","of Egypt and

"],["709.74","uh the armies of pharaoh coming down and "],["711.72","the children of Israel their response "],["713.399","they see the verse 10 the Egyptians "],["716.399","marching after them and they become "],["717.959","frightened "],["719.16","and they say to Moses it's because "],["721.2","there's no graves in Egypt as you've "],["722.7","taken us here to die in the wilderness

have died "],["757.019","they stayed in Egypt would they live "],["758.579","forever "],["759.899","no they would die eventually and do you "],["762.72","think they know that "],["765.72","probably

before the camp of Israel "],["911.88","moved and went behind them and the "],["913.56","pillar of cloud moved from before them "],["915.54","and stood behind them so that the camp "],["917.699","it came between the camp of is the "],["920.04","Egypts and the camp of Israel and there "],["922.5","was a cloud along with darkness and yet "],["924.12","it gave light at night "],["926.04","thus the one did not come near the other "],["928.32","all nights then Moses stretched out his "],["931.56","hand over the sea and the Lord swept the "],["933.12","sweet back by a strong East Wind all "],["935.579","night and turned the sea into dry land "],["937.5","so the waters were divided the sons of "],["940.38","Israel went through the midst of the sea "],["942.3","on dry land and the water was like a "],["944.94","wall on their right hand and on their "],["947.519","left then the Egyptians took up the "],["950.339","pursuit and all the pharaoh's horses and "],["952.74","chariots and

"],["960.36","the cloud and brought the Army Egyptians "],["962.579","into confusion he caused their chariot "],["964.62","wheels to swerve and they he made them "],["967.5","drive with difficulty so the Egyptians "],["969.6","said let's flee from Israel the Lord is "],["971.639","fighting against them against the "],["973.139","Egyptians and the Lord said to Moses "],["975.959","stretch out your

the sea and the Sea returned to its "],["985.62","normal state of Daybreak while the "],["987.12","Egyptians were fleeing right into it "],["988.98","then the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in "],["991.139","the midst of the sea the water returned "],["993.12","and covered the Chariots and the "],["994.32","horsemen and even Pharaoh's entire Army "],["996.54","that had gone into the sea after them "],["997.86","not even one of them remains but the "],["1000.86","sons of Israel walked on dry land "],["1003.019","through the midst of the Sea and the "],["1004.759","waters were like a

"],["1012.38","Egyptians dead on the seashore when God "],["1015.019","saw when the Israel saw the great power "],["1017.36","which the Lord had used against the "],["1018.68","Egyptians the people

to enjoy the passing pleasures "],["260.579","of sin considering their approach of "],["262.979","Christ greater riches than the treasures "],["266.1","of Egypt for he was looking for looking "],["269.04","to the reward by faith he left Egypt not "],["271.979","fearing the Wrath of the king for he "],["274.68","endured as seeing him who is unseen "],["279.78","so this passage "],["281.699","is referring to Exodus chapter 3 after "],["285.72","Moses meets God the phrase as seeing him "],["289.62","who is unseen well that's a reference to "],["292.86","when God when Moses first met God in the "],["296.46","burning bush right but before we get to "],["299.34","that encounter before we get into all "],["301.32","that and I don't know how long it's "],["302.46","going to study Moses but you know we'll "],["304.5","see I want to take a moment to look at "],["306.96","what happened to Moses life prior to the "],["309.78","burning bush and we actually have a "],["311.94","little bit about that in Acts chapter 7 "],["315.36","turn to Acts chapter 7. and this is a "],["319.62","part of the speech that sir that Stephen "],["322.56","gives right before the people stoned him "],["326.16","to death "],["327.36","quite a sermon "],["328.919","after you're done speaking the audience "],["331.139","Pelt you with stones until you're dead "],["333.6","on

that happens God's word "],["343.199","is very Politically Incorrect and when I "],["346.62","express his views uh sometimes people "],["350.46","get up and walk out and I find that kind "],["353.22","of distracting and like always like oh I "],["355.62","hit a nerve and I feel bad about that I "],["358.32","never want to offend anyone even if I'm "],["360.78","telling them the truth but often it "],["362.88","can't be helped Jesus is a rock of "],["366.36","offense "],["367.32","and the word of the Lord is always "],["369.84","offensive to people who do not want to "],["373.56","believe it so Stephen was the first "],["375.979","follower of Jesus to be put to death but "],["379.38","he wasn't the last "],["381.9","that's still going on today "],["384","it is a

even now we you're not "],["438.539","gonna hear about that stuff in "],["439.62","mainstream media but it's going on so I "],["443.039","guess I should be grateful people simply "],["444.66","leave mid-sermon as opposed to stoning "],["448.44","me "],["449.16","but listen to this portion of Stephen's "],["451.62","sermon before they hit him with rocks uh "],["454.68","7 verse 22 acts 7 verse 22 talking about "],["458.46","Moses he says Moses was educated in all "],["461.759","the learning of the Egyptians and he was "],["463.919","a man of power in words and deed but "],["467.639","when he was approaching the age of 40 it "],["470.22","entered his mind to visit his brother "],["471.9","and the sons of Israel and when he saw "],["474.419","one of them being treated unjustly he "],["476.699","defended him and took Vengeance for the "],["478.62","oppressed by striking down the Egyptian "],["482.28","and he supposed that his Brethren "],["484.74","understood that God was granting them "],["487.02","Deliverance through him "],["489.3","but they did not understand "],["491.699","well on the following day "],["494.099","he appeared to them as they were

yesterday do you "],["517.56","at that remark Moses fled and became an "],["520.919","alien in the land of Midian where he "],["523.5","became the father of two sons "],["525.839","after 40 years had passed an angel "],["528.6","appeared to him in the wilderness Mount "],["530.7","Sinai in the flame of the burning bush "],["536.459","you remember last week right "],["539.22","yeah "],["540.08","Moses was raised by his mother in a "],["543.42","Jewish home but once he was weaned he "],["546.54","went to live as Pharaoh's daughter's son "],["549.899","he became Pharaoh's grandson "],["554.04","so what age "],["556.019","did he transition from the slave home to "],["558.6","the Royal home "],["559.8","the Bible doesn't say "],["561.6","but it says after he was weaned now in "],["564.899","ancient times weaning was a kind of a "],["567.36","slower process than it is now we know "],["569.94","science today tells us that mother's "],["572.339","milk is an excellent natural source of "],["574.38","antibodies so three years was normal for "],["578.339","a child to be on the mother's milk "],["579.98","furthermore I suspect weaning includes "],["582.779","more than just breastfeeding but potty "],["586.019","training I suspect that would have been "],["588.54","the other part of the assignment right "],["589.8","the princess of Egypt is not going to "],["591.36","want to potty train a kid so "],["594.24","probably you know Moses mom had to deal "],["597","with that job uh what else what else do "],["599.519","you learn in those years how to feed "],["601.62","yourself put on your clothes right how "],["604.26","to talk lots to learn in the first "],["606.42","couple years of life it reminded me of a "],["609.54","similar thing that happened in first "],["611.459","Samuel you remember uh Samuel little "],["613.74","little baby Samuel Hannah had Samuel and "],["617.339","he was taken to live with Eli in the "],["619.56","temple once he was weaned uh and then "],["622.62","look at for looking for Samuel chapter "],["625.019","one "],["626.7","just to make this observation here to "],["628.5","you first Samuel chapter 21 "],["631.44","chapter 1 verse 21 "],["633.72","it says "],["636.24","then the man elkanaya went up with all "],["640.26","his household offer to the Lord the "],["642.54","early sacrifice and pay his vows so "],["644.459","that's Hannah's husband but Hannah did "],["647.76","not go up or she said to her husband I "],["649.92","will not go up until the child is weaned "],["652.38","then I will bring him up then he might "],["654.6","appear before the Lord and stay there "],["656.339","forever so we know he promised to give "],["658.74","Samuel over to the Lord so verse 24 now "],["663.899","when she had weaned him she took him up "],["666.66","with her with a three-year-old Bull and "],["669.54","an e fought a flower and a jug of wine "],["671.1","and brought him to the house of the Lord "],["672.66","in Shiloh although the child was young "],["675.959","and then we see like chapter 2 verses 1 "],["679.26","through 10 is Hannah's song She's "],["681.18","praising the Lord uh and then verse 11 "],["684.36","chapter 211 alkaniah went to his home in "],["688.2","Rama but the boy so that's Samuel "],["690.74","ministered to the Lord before Eli the "],["694.14","priest and then again that said in "],["697.5","Chapter 2 Verse 18 Samuel was "],["699.72","ministering before the Lord as a boy "],["701.519","wearing a little nephot "],["703.92","so it says he's Ministry the little guy "],["707.339","is ministering doing Temple duties so it "],["710.94","means he's old enough to understand and "],["712.92","follow some instructions so my personal "],["715.38","opinion is based on that observation is "],["718.079","that these children who are weaned the "],["721.32","earliest that would have been would have "],["722.579","been probably around five years old "],["724.14","maybe older and the reason why that "],["726.3","sparks my interest is because of what it "],["729.48","said here in Acts chapter 7 verse 23 "],["732.8","where it talks about Moses "],["736.86","when he approached the age of 40 it "],["738.779","entered his mind to visit his brother "],["740.399","and the sons of Israel "],["743.16","see Moses knows he's not Egyptian "],["747.6","he knows he's an Israelite and later on "],["750.6","we see at the scene of the burning bush "],["752.16","he even knows his brother Aaron his "],["756.3","older brother Aaron if Moses had gone "],["758.88","from living in uh Pharaoh's house at the "],["763.38","age of two or three like when he just "],["765","got done breastfeeding he wouldn't have "],["767.1","known he wouldn't have remembered about "],["769.019","his birth family "],["770.76","so he had to be there long enough to be "],["772.98","taught who he was who his family was who "],["775.98","his siblings were and at the age of 40 "],["778.44","he's still thinking about them he has in "],["780.839","his mindset that God wants him to "],["783.06","deliver his people from bondage verse 25 "],["785.6","and he said acts 7 verse 25 I know I'm "],["789.12","all over the place he suppose that his "],["790.74","brother understood that God was granting "],["792.54","them Deliverance through him but they "],["794.76","did not understand where would he come "],["796.38","up with that idea "],["797.639","that God was going to use him to deliver "],["799.38","them "],["801.42","well I suspect his mom and his dad when "],["804.72","he was a little guy were telling him you "],["807.18","know Moses one day you're going to go "],["809.519","live with the Queen of Egypt one day "],["812.279","you're going to be Pharaoh's grandson "],["813.72","you're going to go live over there "],["815.399","because God saved you from death God "],["818.519","saved you from the Nile and he has got a "],["821.279","plan for you Moses he's going to use you "],["823.32","to Deliver Us From Slavery he's going to "],["825.54","use you to Deliver Us from bondage don't "],["827.94","forget about us Moses when you're in "],["829.5","Egypt don't forget about your mom and "],["831.12","dad don't forget about your brothers and "],["832.38","sisters I won't Mommy I promise "],["836.22","so he gets his head when he's 40. I "],["839.1","gotta help my brother "],["840.6","I gotta rally them I gotta lead them I "],["842.399","gotta deliver them and why not after all "],["844.86","these royalty he's educated in the "],["846.899","king's Palace uh acts 7 22 Moses was "],["850.32","educated in all the learning of the "],["851.88","Egyptians he was a man of power in words "],["854.459","remember that he's a man of power and "],["857.16","words and deeds "],["860.04","he's connected to power he has all the "],["861.959","resources he's young but not too young "],["863.579","he's old but not too old "],["865.32","he'd be the perfect one for the job "],["869.1","when you were young you have these great "],["872.22","aspirations to do great things and make "],["875.22","a change in the world and we assume you "],["877.98","know people understand that we're here "],["880.32","to help and we have great ideas we have "],["882.54","we have the answers "],["884.339","but then we get this rude awakening that "],["886.92","people "],["888.12","don't understand how awesome our ideas "],["889.86","are "],["891","people aren't all that interested in our "],["892.56","visions and our big plans to help "],["894.98","uh Moses gets hit with this acts 7 25 he "],["899.399","supposed his brother and understood that "],["901.019","God was granting them Deliverance "],["902.88","through him "],["904.199","but they did not understand "],["907.079","well Moses great idea delivers his "],["909.12","people results in him "],["911.76","killing a man being criticized by his "],["914.459","Brethren who he's trying to stand up for "],["915.899","and then we see in the story of Exodus "],["919.139","that Pharaoh finds out and he wants to "],["921.06","kill him acts uh to "],["923.1","15 Pharaoh heard about the matter he "],["924.959","tried to kill Moses Moses fled from the "],["926.579","presence of pharaoh settled in the land "],["928.199","of Midian and sat down by a well "],["932.1","so he's now a fugitive he has to leave "],["935.16","the country and he's out hiding for how "],["936.6","long "],["937.86","40 years "],["939.959","I think this is a very interesting part "],["941.82","of Moses life story humanly speaking "],["945.12","practically speaking when Moses was 40 "],["947.1","and in a position of power that was the "],["950.399","time for him to step up and Lead "],["952.62","humanly speaking "],["954.24","but "],["955.32","it wasn't God's time for whatever reason "],["959.519","right idea "],["961.32","wrong time "],["962.88","but because Moses tries to execute in "],["965.16","his own strength he all but destroys "],["968.519","himself and I think this is an important "],["970.92","observation especially for maybe the "],["973.5","younger portion of the congregation of "],["975.839","the demographic here we have these great "],["978.12","ideas of what we want to do we have "],["979.44","visions and dreams and it all may be "],["981.839","very good stuff but when you try to "],["984.779","execute these ideas in your own strength "],["987.48","you will find out that the world does "],["989.82","not care and will chew you up and spit "],["992.579","you out "],["994.26","and this verse kind of proves my points "],["997.32","the psalmist writes unless the Lord "],["1000.32","builds the house they labor in

"],["47.219","what's that all about hmm "],["49.86","so this is an interesting example of "],["51.78","faith of course we expect the author of "],["53.52","Hebrews to talk about one of the most

"],["344.06","context the king of Egypt spoke to the "],["347.46","Hebrew midwives and said uh when you see "],["350.4","helping the Hebrew women give birth and "],["352.62","you see upon the

"],["361.5","commanded them let the boys live so the "],["363.24","king of Egypt called The Midwives and "],["364.5","said why have you done this thing let "],["365.82","these boys live maybe why I said to "],["367.62","Pharaoh well because the Hebrew women "],["368.88","are not like Egyptian women they're "],["370.44","vigorous and they give birth before we "],["371.88","can even get there so

"],["177.019","and wrapping up with Joseph "],["180.319","transitioning on "],["182.64","Hebrews chapter 11 22 by faith Joseph "],["184.86","when he was dying made mention of The "],["188.099","Exodus of the children of Israel gave "],["190.92","orders concerning his bones concerning "],["194.04","his bones what are they doing with those "],["195.72","old bones "],["197.04","turn to Genesis chapter 50.

"],["258.12","so Joseph died at the age of 110 was "],["261.419","embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt "],["264.84","even though Joseph had great success in "],["267.419","Egypt he had accumulated

honoring God "],["40.02","despite all the bad things that were "],["41.64","happening to him and that was a good "],["44.28","lesson for us to learn now today we will "],["46.44","conclude the series and see what God is "],["49.98","doing through it all so his brothers "],["51.84","were doing this Joseph was doing this "],["53.34","and here's what God was doing "],["56.399","we briefly mentioned how Joseph had "],["58.8","dreams that seemed to be prophetic his "],["61.98","symbolic dream portrayed his entire "],["64.92","family bowing down to him and for this "],["67.5","reason his brothers hated him one of "],["69.72","many reasons but while he was in prison "],["72.6","and that's where we left him last week "],["73.92","remember he was in prison uh two other "],["76.5","fellas two other prisoners had dreams "],["78.6","these two guys were put into prison by "],["80.64","pharaoh and there were troubled by their "],["84.72","dreams so we're in Genesis chapter 40 "],["87.84","even though we're studying the book of "],["89.58","Hebrews and we're going to do a lot of "],["92.64","Genesis today so get your Bible out "],["95.4","and follow along lots to read so we're "],["98.579","in chapter 40. and "],["101.28","um "],["102.06","verse number one "],["104.34","so it came about after all these things "],["106.68","the cup bear and the baker for the king

"],["287.4","God does not have to use dreams and "],["290.28","Visions as much as he did before now we "],["293.699","have a copy of his word that's not to "],["296.04","say that he cannot or he does not God "],["298.979","can communicate to community to speak to "],["302.34","us however he chooses in places in the "],["305.759","world in cultures where the word of God "],["307.86","is illegal and

these things we believe in the "],["389.639","Supernatural we believe in the things of "],["392.46","a spiritual nature that being said there "],["395.88","is a fine line that we must walk when it "],["398.639","comes to the supernatural the holy "],["400.74","spirit is real and ever present and at "],["403.44","work "],["404.46","we do not want to be guilty of quenching "],["407.46","the spirit but we also have clear "],["410.039","interpretation clear instructions that "],["413.1","we ought to test all the spirits John "],["416.46","said beloved do not believe every Spirit "],["419.16","but test the spirits whether they are of "],["421.62","God because many false prophets have "],["424.86","come into the world so here at Faith "],["427.68","Bible Church we want to be sensitive to "],["429.72","the spirits leading open to visions and "],["432.419","burdens that people feel they have from "],["434.699","the Lord some of us do believe that we "],["437.639","heard the Lord speak to us in our sleep "],["439.319","we do believe God has inspired us to say "],["442.139","things on his behalf but whatever we "],["444.36","feel is a personal calling we also "],["447.12","submit these ideas to the authority and "],["450.24","the institution that Jesus established "],["452.94","here in the church he said he founded "],["455.88","his church in Matthew chapter 16 your "],["458.16","Peter and on this rock I build my church "],["460.68","and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail "],["462.599","against it so the the commission the "],["465.84","doctrine the leadership of the church is "],["468.479","all built and backed by the word of God "],["472.02","so the callings that we feel we have "],["474.72","from God are to be confirmed by The "],["477.66","Authority that is invested in the church "],["480.08","the callings and the "],["483.3","feelings we have that we think are from "],["485.28","God it has to be confirmed by The "],["487.56","Authority that is vested in the church "],["488.94","and I'm very thankful and I'm very "],["490.74","pleased to report that all of the "],["492.96","Ministries that we are partnering with "],["495.06","and supporting they continue to maintain "],["497.88","a good working relationship with the "],["499.979","spiritual leaders of our church and we "],["502.5","affirm their visions and we support "],["504.84","their mission because we do believe they "],["507.84","are biblically based and they're working "],["509.639","in conjunction with our Great Commission "],["511.8","Now that isn't to say we never disagree "],["514.32","with some of the day and today decisions "],["516.12","and the individual choices that some of "],["518.64","our partners may make "],["520.08","we don't even agree with every program "],["522.779","that we initiate "],["524.82","Greg and I could give you a whole list "],["526.44","of things that we've tried and later "],["527.88","said I don't know if that was such a "],["529.62","great idea let's pivot from that "],["531.779","Ministry idea yeah let's try something "],["534.12","else it isn't that it was an idea it was "],["536.94","contrary to the word of God or "],["538.38","disobedient but maybe it's just not as "],["540.36","effective as we thought it'd be so some "],["543.06","folks in here today they come up with "],["545.279","really cool ideas and sometimes we give "],["547.62","them a go and other times we say I don't "],["550.08","know if that's really something we want "],["551.76","to explore I we might have our our "],["554.04","doubts on that particular Vision but we "],["558.18","re you might really believe well this "],["561.24","this is from God I really felt that that "],["563.64","was from God okay well maybe it is but "],["565.56","maybe it's not just remember God has "],["567.779","given authority to the church leadership "],["569.6","to lead and to determine and rule on who "],["574.2","and what the church does so one of those "],["577.32","passages that we look to is the "],["579.48","instructions that Paul gave Timothy when "],["581.88","he was telling them how to do church he "],["584.399","said uh those who continue in sin rebuke "],["586.62","present in front of all so the rest will "],["589.14","be fearful of sinning I solemnly exhort "],["591.12","you in the presence of God in Christ "],["593.04","Jesus and his chosen angels to maintain "],["594.959","these principles although bias do "],["597.24","nothing in a spirit of partiality do not "],["599.76","lay hands upon anyone too quickly "],["602.399","thereby sharing responsibility for the "],["604.26","sins of others keep yourself free from "],["606.72","sin there is a process of laying on of "],["610.2","the hands "],["611.3","ordaining who was to be the Elder of the "],["615.42","church and this is what Paul and all the "],["617.339","apostles did in every town that was "],["619.68","their practice everywhere as they went "],["621.24","so think about it anyone "],["623.58","could just come in here at Faith Bible "],["625.14","Church and we do this fun thing and it's "],["628.26","very interesting new people will tell me "],["629.7","man that's I've never seen that before "],["631.8","that's really I really like that did you "],["633.779","just send the microphones out there and "],["635.399","everybody talks but also what's one of "],["638.279","the concerns about that anybody can get "],["640.5","the mic and say oh I have a word from "],["641.94","the Lord for you this morning and I have "],["643.86","a vision and I have this dream and work "],["646.2","that thus says the Lord this and that "],["647.88","and the other thing and uh that wouldn't "],["649.92","be acceptable "],["651.3","because we know according to God's word "],["653.519","not everyone claiming to be led of the "],["656.459","spirit is actually letter of the spirit "],["658.079","and thus God has given us the authority "],["660.779","to confirm or deny to accept or reject "],["664.14","all these visions and I understand that "],["667.86","this is you know a little bit in the "],["669.3","weeds this morning but I think this is "],["671.459","important that you understand some of "],["673.44","the specifics of these things I'm kind "],["676.14","of sharing with you now I'm opening up "],["678.72","the inner workings of the leadership so "],["681.24","you can see whether the philosophies "],["683.399","that govern what we're doing and why "],["685.14","we're doing them in order to be in "],["687.06","leadership of Faith Bible Church you "],["688.8","don't just you know walk in and grab a "],["690.48","mic and say uh God told me to do this "],["692.339","right there's actually some processes in "],["695.16","place there's a membership class Steve "],["697.56","just congratulations just finished the "],["699.42","membership class and get a membership "],["700.56","and in that class covered all the "],["703.019","doctrines uh what we believe and uh what "],["706.62","we expect a church membership to a "],["708.839","member to do and then they sign their "],["711.6","name agreeing uh once they've gone "],["714.06","through the class they sign everybody "],["715.26","signs their name agreeing I first of all "],["717.3","have committed my life to Jesus Christ "],["718.86","I'm trusting in Him for salvation "],["720.959","confessing with your mouth and believing "],["722.76","with your heart Lord Jesus Christ and "],["724.62","you shall be saved second of all "],["727.32","the members have said I I have taken the "],["729.839","step of obedience to be baptized as "],["732.66","modeled by our Lord and Savior Jesus "],["734.76","Christ when he got baptized and as "],["736.56","instructed by the Apostle Peter in Acts "],["738.66","chapter 2 uh in the big sermon in "],["741.959","Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost "],["743.459","everybody was there there and they heard "],["745.62","his sermon and they were cut to the "],["747.36","heart and and said to Peter and the rest "],["749.64","of the Apostles well men and Brethren "],["751.2","what should we do and G and Peter said "],["753.06","you are to repent and then let everyone "],["757.26","be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ "],["759.24","for the remissions of sins so you'll "],["760.92","receive the holy spirit for the promise "],["762.72","is to you and your children to all who "],["764.7","are far off as many as the Lord Our God "],["767.399","will call so that's the second step of "],["769.74","being a member you get baptized and then "],["771.839","third when you sign off you're going to "],["773.76","check I agree to abide by the membership "],["776.579","agreement as Brian Neville taught me in "],["778.74","the class "],["779.7","after that step we would expect to see "],["783.24","someone show a level of faithfulness "],["786.36","and attending and service to the body of "],["789.6","Christ and once we've seen a pattern of "],["791.7","faithfulness and godly Behavior we would "],["794.22","then be prepared to entertain the idea "],["796.38","that you would have some vision from the "],["798.3","Lord but we want to hear all about it "],["800.7","and discuss it and pray about it and we "],["803.16","want to search the scriptures and see if "],["804.72","it's consistent with the revealed word "],["806.399","of God anyone who is in a position of "],["808.8","leadership has been scrutinized and "],["811.92","evaluated in this church they're in "],["814.2","there if you're in a Ministry if you're "],["815.459","leading uh you have been scrutinized and "],["818.1","you've been evaluated all callings from "],["820.86","God that people feel they have have to "],["824.16","be confirmed by the church leadership "],["826.26","that's not Pastor Rob's process that's "],["828.959","God's process why is it necessary "],["832.04","because it protects us from false "],["835.079","teachers and false teaching it re "],["837.72","retards the rise of bad leadership it "],["840.54","stays off the wolves in sheep's clothing "],["843.26","and to let you know they do come knock "],["846.3","talking from time to time you don't "],["848.22","necessarily know about them because it's

the People's Church in "],["1830.899","Charles and we were looking to move and "],["1832.76","we were looking down here because we "],["1834.38","wanted to get back here Eliana really "],["1836.12","wanted to get out of the cold in the "],["1837.799","snow Banks and she wanted to get back "],["1839.36","down here with the family but instead uh "],["1842.419","I moved her to New

living upset at me "],["1880.22","and even upset at God "],["1882.14","she confessed all this to the Lord and "],["1884.779","asked him help make me content with "],["1887.96","living here in Canada "],["1889.58","and with months within months of praying "],["1891.62","that prayer "],["1892.64","of submission "],["1894.38","we moved back here in 2004 got back into "],["1897.02","America "],["1898.1","and Eliana often thought well the Lord "],["1900.14","was using that time to test my faith and "],["1902.72","grow me which he was "],["1904.94","but what we didn't know until two weeks "],["1907.34","ago "],["1908.12","was if the Lord had permitted us to come "],["1910.58","into the states in 2000 we would have "],["1912.98","been booted out a year later and never "],["1915.559","allowed to return "],["1917.24","so not only did he have us in New "],["1919.52","Brunswick to test our faith and grow us "],["1921.08","he was also protecting us "],["1923.48","from

"],["142.14","and uh to be candid life is not fair "],["145.62","there's always someone who wins and "],["147.06","someone who loses there's always someone "],["148.319","who has more and someone who

privileges that they do "],["158.879","not and this can breed a attitude of "],["162.06","resentment now I noticed "],["164.519","some things that I thought were unfair "],["166.62","early on in my

"],["193.739","noticed kids with nicer clothes and "],["195.72","cooler toys they they had money to spend "],["198.3","that we didn't have I I heard I heard "],["201.18","girls say that they thought

"],["227.64","but I always knew I was privileged "],["230.159","I'd heard about people living behind the "],["232.62","Iron Curtain in the USSR with no "],["234.84","freedoms living lives oppressed "],["238.739","and uh "],["240.42","I knew that we had it better than them I "],["242.519","heard about people in China getting run "],["245.4","over by tanks and Tiananmen Square their "],["248.34","own country's military were crushing "],["250.439","them and I didn't have to worry about "],["252","that in Canada I don't I don't even know "],["253.439","if we have a tank but uh yeah anyways "],["256.919","I saw pictures of people "],["261.479","crops no nothing "],["263.46","I always understood "],["265.199","that I had it better in Canada we we had "],["267.84","freedoms we had opportunities to go to "],["269.699","school and and work and live our lives "],["272.16","so yes some people had it better than me "],["274.62","but overall I was privileged my parents "],["278.04","loved me they took care of me I had a "],["279.84","home I had I had food "],["283.5","I had safe place to live "],["286.44","that's a privilege "],["288.18","many people had more

make you feel about others "],["302.699","how does that make you feel about God "],["305.1","these are the questions that we get to "],["306.66","explore today as we begin the study on "],["308.58","Joseph but as we look into this passage "],["310.8","today's lesson is going to be more so "],["312.979","what not to do "],["315.18","last time we looked at uh Jacob his "],["318.24","father Jacob and he was on his way to "],["321.36","find a wife "],["322.8","and he really excelled at that because "],["324.9","he ended up with "],["326.34","four wives "],["327.78","wasn't his intention to have four wives "],["329.699","this was due to trickery of his "],["331.82","father-in-law Laban and their cultural "],["334.38","norms in the Book of Genesis we often "],["336.78","see unscrupulous activities by these "],["338.94","ancient people which I don't want to get "],["340.74","into all the details of that today but "],["342.36","the result is Jacob ends up with four "],["344.52","wives when we study the Bible we always "],["347.4","have to be mindful of the context "],["350.28","just because the story is telling us "],["352.32","something that happened doesn't mean "],["354.36","it's instructing us to do the same so "],["357.539","don't leave here today saying I learned "],["359.22","in the Bible from Pastor Rob that it's "],["361.44","okay to have four wives that is most "],["363.66","definitely not what it is saying there's "],["367.199","plenty of examples of what not to do "],["369.24","recorded for us in the Bible and we're "],["371.039","going to get into one of those today but "],["372.6","Jacob had four wives don't do that okay "],["375.3","just want to clear that "],["376.919","but the one he truly loved and "],["379.8","originally had his heart set on marrying "],["381.539","was of course "],["383.16","Rachel now Rachel was unable to have "],["386.22","children meanwhile The Other Women ended "],["388.44","up giving Jacob ten Sons between the "],["391.319","three of them finally the Lord blessed "],["394.58","Rachel's womb and she gave birth to "],["397.38","Jacob's 11th son which they

"],["737.64","much they hated him verse number 12.

"],["765.839","the field kind of confused and the man "],["767.339","said what are you looking for he said "],["768.839","I'm looking for my brothers and he's "],["770.279","tell me are they pastoring the flocks "],["772.32","and the man said well I heard they were "],["773.7","moving from here they said let's go to "],["775.5","dotham so Joseph went after his brothers "],["777.72","and found them in Dothan "],["779.82","when they saw him from a distance and "],["782.639","before he came close to them they "],["784.26","plotted against him to put him to death "],["787.22","they said one to

"],["799.019","let's see what becomes of his dreams "],["801.74","that's in the Hebrew the original the "],["804.3","evil cackle "],["807.18","now then come let's kill him but Reuben "],["809.7","he's the oldest heard this and rescued "],["812.339","the mother hands he said let's let's not "],["813.899","take his life "],["815.399","Reuben further said shed no blood throw "],["817.32","him in this

"],["862.38","brother and cover up his blood come now "],["864.06","let's sell him to the ishmaelites and "],["867.24","not lay hands on him for he is our "],["868.98","brother he's our own flesh and his "],["871.38","brothers listen to him "],["872.94","so then some of the media trainers "],["874.8","passed by so they pulled him up lifted "],["877.019","Joseph out of the pit and sold him to "],["878.76","the Museum of lights for 20 Circles of "],["880.86","silver thus they brought Joseph into "],["883.92","Egypt "],["885.72","now Reuben returned to the pit and "],["887.399","behold

"],["894.48","Joseph's tunic slaughtered a male goat "],["897","dipped the tunic in blood sent the very "],["899.459","kind of tunic and brought it to their "],["901.98","father saying "],["903.24","we we found this "],["905.88","please examine it to see whether it's "],["908.1","your son's tunic or not "],["910.199","he examined it he said it is my son's "],["912.48","tunic a wild

"],["921.3","all of the sons and the daughters arose "],["923.88","to comfort him but he refused to be "],["926.519","comforted he said surely I will go down "],["929.22","to sheol in mourning for my

"],["40.62","because he's such a conniving character "],["43.98","came out of the womb grabbing a hold of "],["45.96","his twin brother's heel maybe something "],["48.12","the uh "],["49.32","we'll see what the Bell kids if they "],["50.82","come out like that and marry if they "],["52.32","come up grabbing heels those Twins and "],["55.62","prophetically that's who he becomes he's "],["57.539","always seen as the heel Grabber which "],["60.3","means subplanter that's what his name "],["62.399","Jacob means supplanter uh someone who "],["65.22","replaces or oustes another and it just "],["68.28","seems that he's always getting ahead "],["70.38","when someone else is tripped up so he's "],["73.08","such a flawed character to be in the by "],["75.479","faith chapter but on the other hand "],["77.34","there are 15 chapters devoted to him in "],["81.36","the Book of Genesis so obviously the "],["83.46","Holy Spirit wanted us to know Jacob and "],["86.88","learn from him "],["89.04","Jacob may be a flawed character but for "],["92.4","whatever reason God blessed him "],["94.74","so I think it would be intriguing to "],["97.2","figure out why because guess what "],["101.939","I too am a flawed character "],["105.54","so I can relate to Jacob I am far from "],["107.939","perfect and yet for whatever reason God "],["109.68","blesses me so if you're here today and "],["113.159","you are less than perfect you're kind of "],["115.5","a hot mess spiritually then this study "],["118.32","on the life of Jacob could be exactly "],["120.78","what you need let's go to Genesis "],["124.079","chapter 25. "],["127.32","we'll be all over the place in Genesis "],["129.06","today so just be ready to read Genesis "],["131.819","chapter 25 and More in verse 21. "],["134.879","okay so we're picking up the story Isaac "],["137.64","prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife "],["139.86","because she was Barren and the Lord "],["142.62","answered him and Rebecca his wife "],["145.319","conceived Genesis 25 verse 22 but the "],["149.04","children struggle together within her "],["150.72","and she said if it is so why then am I "],["154.68","this way so she inquired of the Lord "],["157.5","the Lord said to her "],["159.36","two nations are in your womb "],["161.519","two peoples will be separated from your "],["164.16","body the one people shall be stronger "],["166.44","than the other the older will serve the "],["169.5","younger winter days to be delivered were "],["172.019","fulfilled behold there were twins in her "],["174.36","womb now the first came forth red all "],["176.94","over like a hairy garment and his name "],["178.92","was Esau afterwards his brother came "],["181.319","forth with his hand-holding Esau's heel "],["184.14","so they called his name is called Jacob "],["186.66","and Isaac was 60 years old when uh "],["190.739","Rebecca gave birth to them "],["193.019","so Isaac has uh twin Sons Esau pop suit "],["196.62","first Jacob is literally on his heels "],["199.319","and holding on to the brother's heel but "],["202.44","that's more than a coincidence because "],["204.599","of the prophecy God gave about these "],["208.08","Sons he said there's two people in your "],["211.14","body the one will be stronger than the "],["213.42","other the older will serve the younger "],["218.879","remember Isaac was Abraham's son of "],["222.42","Promise so the birthright the blessings "],["226.44","promised to Abraham would be passed down "],["229.26","to him and typically the first Blood son "],["231.78","receives the birthright only one of "],["234.239","these twins is now going to get that "],["236.34","blessing the prophecy seems to indicate "],["239.76","that the younger is going to receive it "],["242.099","but that is just not the standard "],["243.9","practice the birthright is emphasized in "],["246.48","the Bible because it honored the rights "],["248.22","and privileges of the Father the "],["249.9","family's firstborn son the father if he "],["252.84","died or or if he was absent the "],["255.48","firstborn would assume the father's "],["257.94","Authority and responsibilities so power "],["261.419","control over the uh leadership role of "],["265.32","the family the uh livestock the property "],["268.86","the servants and even younger members of "],["271.44","the family and these families were like "],["273.479","tribes and so the father acted like a "],["276.3","chief so in addition to assuming the "],["278.759","leadership role in the family the "],["280.08","recipient of the birthright inherited "],["282.12","twice that would have been received by "],["284.46","the other sons and then of course the "],["286.199","birthright of a king uh the firstborn "],["288.78","would get the "],["290.4","the throne "],["292.139","so this concept of Birthright becomes a "],["294.6","big deal here in Genesis 25 there's "],["297.24","twins only one can get the Covenant "],["299.88","blessing of God that was made with "],["301.86","Abraham and I think we ought to consider "],["305.54","that part of what is being handled down "],["308.04","in this Birthright is this connection "],["310.62","with God God spoke with Abraham God "],["314.699","spoke with Isaac and the Hope here would "],["317.58","be that God is now going to speak to the "],["319.74","next line whichever one of these two "],["321.78","sons gets it uh I think it's important "],["324.12","to understand that the birthright this "],["325.919","one is not like any other Birthright in "],["327.84","the Old Testament any other Birthright "],["329.46","in the culture because of the Divine "],["331.38","connection "],["332.82","culturally the oldest is supposed to get "],["334.5","it so that should be "],["336.6","Esau verse 27 when the boys grew up Esau "],["340.919","became a skilled Hunter a man of the "],["343.08","field but Jacob a peaceful man living in "],["345.72","tents "],["346.68","now Isaac loved Esau because he had a "],["350.22","taste for a game "],["351.78","but Rebecca loved Isaac when Jacob had "],["355.919","cooked a stew okay I want to stop right "],["358.919","there so just the the uh the favoritism "],["361.68","we see uh between uh the parents often "],["366.3","the thing that dads are into is "],["368.82","something that they want the sons to get "],["370.56","into because they say you know we Bond "],["371.82","over this this is something we do "],["373.02","together so when I was little my father "],["375.3","coached

"],["385.68","everybody during the games so this "],["387.3","spawned a love for basketball in me I "],["389.46","love watching it playing it and even "],["391.259","though I wasn't much of an athlete

that we think about is what "],["931.199","we are currently feeling and "],["933.42","experiencing "],["934.86","well this is life this is all that life "],["937.019","is what what would a Birthright what's "],["939.72","that going to do to change anything "],["942","now Jacob on the other hand can see "],["944.82","beyond his current life setting "],["947.339","he has the ability to sacrifice

"],["1543.62","them from someplace else because they "],["1544.94","weren't from Canaan and that's a subtle "],["1548.36","interesting detail they were all "],["1550.64","foreigners and strangers "],["1553.4","and that was one of the challenges about "],["1555.02","not being from America and then trying "],["1558.02","to get back here because I had no job "],["1560.059","and I didn't have any

"],["1588.86","someplace without any prospects it was "],["1591.5","too hard for me "],["1592.94","which is why I will always testify "],["1596.12","that it was an act of God to get us down "],["1599.179","here to open these doors and after 10 "],["1601.64","years of waiting Ileana 2 would say it "],["1605.059","was God who opened the doors it was God "],["1607.34","who made the way who fulfilled that hope "],["1609.74","in my heart wasn't Rob "],["1612.62","God always wanted the nation to "],["1615.38","understand that the battles and the "],["1617.659","conquest of the land would not be won by "],["1620.12","might or by power but by God's spirit "],["1623.72","and the prophet Zechariah says the word "],["1626.539","of the Lord saying not by mights nor by "],["1629.9","power

to claim it in "],["1653.419","their own power it was something that "],["1655.4","God gave to them verse 13 that's I just "],["1658.22","thought that was an interesting detail "],["1660.44","that none of these people were from "],["1662","Canaan they were all foreigners and "],["1663.5","strangers and why did God not want them "],["1665.539","to be from Canaan well that was kind of "],["1667.039","an interesting Rabbit Trail there was "],["1669.32","problems with Canaanites wasn't there "],["1670.82","they had a passion for false gods and "],["1673.22","Pagan rituals and

on "],["28.56","through our study we're in verse number "],["30.599","eight and by faith Abraham let's look at "],["34.44","Abraham today Hebrews 11 8 by faith "],["37.739","Abraham when he was called obeyed by "],["40.739","going out to a place which he was not "],["43.379","which he was to receive for an "],["45.36","inheritance he went out not knowing "],["47.94","where he was going "],["49.5","by faith he lived as an alien in the "],["51.719","land of promise as in a foreign land "],["54.78","dwelling intense with Isaac and Jacob "],["56.699","fellow Heirs of the same promise for he "],["59.28","was looking for a city which has "],["61.68","foundations whose architect and Builder "],["64.5","is God so I thought this passage is very "],["67.56","apropos I can relate to Abraham I often "],["70.32","likewise do not know exactly where I'm "],["73.08","going uh Lord I give you my life I want "],["75.36","to follow you okay so where exactly now "],["77.159","is that taking me and uh you know don't "],["80.34","didn't get the big thou shell to become "],["82.619","a pastor never heard an official call "],["84.9","like that but here I am pastor and "],["87","leading a church and where are we going "],["88.979","Pastor Rob what's the plan we're not "],["91.08","sure so you know I got some ideas not "],["95.82","saying that it's a vision from God he "],["97.259","gave me in a dream so that's why I "],["99.24","thought you know this is time for a "],["100.979","survey that's what the survey is all "],["103.02","about uh like I said I have some ideas "],["105.119","but maybe so do you and it would be "],["107.22","helpful to have your input you know when "],["109.5","Eliana and I go on vacation we uh lay "],["112.68","out the dates and then we book locations "],["114.54","and then we find places to stay and and "],["117","I do a lot of research on what to eat "],["119.88","big shock eh and then you know look at "],["122.159","the places and what the menus are and "],["123.72","then we'll we'll write this all out and "],["125.219","then the boys if they're coming with us "],["126.719","will sit down and say okay guys here's "],["128.099","the plan you know what are your thoughts "],["129.78","because you know it's not just our "],["131.16","vacation it's theirs too and we want "],["132.9","them to have a good time so we'd like to "],["134.34","hear their ideas after all there's "],["136.86","always lots of options so that's what "],["139.44","this survey is all about the leadership "],["141.48","knows the big idea we know what our "],["144","calling is it and where we're going but "],["147.12","uh we would like to also get your input "],["149.64","there are a lot of options of things we "],["151.86","can be doing so please take some time "],["153.84","and fill that out okay so let's uh look "],["156.54","at our next example of living by faith "],["158.879","it's what Hebrews chapter 11 is all "],["160.8","about uh and it's Abraham uh let's go to "],["164.28","Genesis chapter 12. now like when we did "],["167.04","Enoch and able there's just one or two "],["169.86","verses with Abraham there is so much in "],["173.16","Genesis we can't read all of it but uh I "],["176.819","think chapter 12 is a good place to "],["179.04","start so Genesis 12 "],["181.379","verse 1. the Lord said to Abram go forth "],["184.68","from your country and from your "],["186.06","relatives and from your father's house "],["187.5","to a land I will show you I will make "],["190.2","you a great nation I will bless you I "],["193.019","will make your name great so and so you "],["196.26","shall be a blessing I'll bless those "],["198.239","that bless you I will curse those that "],["199.86","curse you and in you all the families of "],["203.099","the earth will be blessed and we call "],["204.9","that the "],["206.72","abrahamic Covenant that's right three "],["208.92","people knew that so Abram went forth as "],["211.44","the Lord had spoken to him lot went with "],["213.959","him Abram was 75 years old when he "],["216.239","departed from heron "],["217.92","Abram "],["219.659","took Sarah his wife and lot his nephew "],["221.819","and all the possessions which they'd "],["223.2","accumulated and the persons which they "],["224.879","had acquired from Herod and they set out "],["227.099","for the land of Canaan thus they came to "],["229.26","the land of Canaan Abram passed through "],["231.48","the land as far as the site of shechem "],["233.58","to the Oak of Mora now the Canaanite was "],["236.879","in the land the Lord appeared to Abram "],["239.22","and said to your descendants I give this "],["241.14","land so he built an altar there to the "],["243.659","Lord who had appeared to him he "],["245.819","proceeded from there to the mountain of "],["247.62","east of Bethel pitched his tent with "],["249.599","Bethel to the on the west and AI on the "],["252.36","East and built an altar to the Lord and "],["254.34","called upon the name of the Lord Abram "],["256.68","journeyed on continuing forward to the "],["258.54","nagap so the big idea here is Abraham is "],["262.68","called by God quite literally God speaks "],["266.04","to him and tells him leave this place "],["268.38","and go to a place I'm going to show you "],["270.419","and Abraham did exactly as he was "],["274.32","instructed now in the Bible we see that "],["277.139","is not always the case "],["279.3","think of any examples Jonah "],["281.759","he ran from God Moses burning bush he's "],["285.3","making excuses Gideon "],["288.419","he negotiated for some signs sorry "],["290.22","Gideons no no slight on you but you know "],["292.86","Gideon's out there I need some signs "],["294.54","Peter he debated with Jesus and then "],["297.24","later on he gets this vision from God "],["299.04","and he debates with God himself but "],["302.1","Abraham doesn't ask any questions he "],["304.68","gets the call and then does what he's "],["306.78","told "],["307.74","doesn't really know this God doesn't "],["310.02","have all the details matter of fact he "],["312","says he doesn't even know "],["314.16","where he's going "],["316.139","it's kind of nerve-wracking don't you "],["317.639","think "],["318.54","you know when you live in a small "],["320.34","community like St Mary's you you it "],["322.56","doesn't take you that long to learn "],["323.88","where everything is because you know you "],["327.3","get familiar with the area and there's "],["328.68","not really a lot here "],["330.3","three roads basically into this County "],["332.28","one road running right up the middle of "],["334.56","the county and water all around us and "],["336.24","if you're out by the water just turn "],["338.16","around go the other way and eventually "],["339.419","you'll run into 235 and that'll take you "],["342.06","right by Faith Bible Church see that's "],["343.44","how you got here right it's great being "],["344.94","on 235 everybody can find you "],["347.22","and since there's no big Metropolis then "],["350.1","we can talk about things uh where "],["352.979","they're located based on the proximity "],["354.66","to things that everyone knows right down "],["357.479","by the base "],["359.94","oh behind the Walmart "],["362.759","we say the because "],["364.74","there's only one right I said well we "],["368.039","were over in Solomon's nobody would say "],["369.84","well I wonder where boats in Solomon's I "],["371.94","I want I wonder where we could find you "],["373.56","in Solomon's chances are we're on the "],["376.56","the boardwalk right only thing that's "],["378.9","really confusing "],["380.34","would be if someone told you to meet "],["383.16","them at the Dollar General "],["386.34","because nobody even knows how many of "],["389.28","those there are they just mysteriously

"],["682.2","the Lord saw that the wickedness of man "],["684.959","was great on the earth and that every "],["687.06","intent of the thoughts of his heart was "],["689.279","only evil continually and

"],["855.18","okay so visualize Noah's building this "],["858.959","really big boat "],["861","something nobody's ever seen before "],["863.16","and this is going to be the means that "],["864.42","he

"],["987.24","starts noticing hey like it's a lot of "],["989.399","trees and really big you're in the "],["992.519","Kentucky been to the ark there you know "],["994.019","that's that's quite a quite

about walking "],["30","with the Lord did a great deal of "],["32.82","walking while I was on vacation "],["35.059","especially Tuesday Tuesday we decided to "],["39.42","visit a very unique Zoo high up in the "],["43.26","Andes Mountains this zoo was 8 500 feet "],["46.92","above sea level and it was not anything "],["50.52","like any zoos we have in America because "],["52.68","in America you've got all of these nice "],["55.28","big concrete paved paths and you can "],["59.039","walk around to all of these exhibits and "],["62.1","enclosures and you can say hey what do "],["64.14","we want to see today you want to see the "],["66.18","pandas yeah we'll go see the pandas and "],["68.46","then we'll go over here Did elephants "],["70.2","and we'll look at our little map and "],["71.58","we'll decide what we want to go and walk "],["73.619","around and see and then maybe part way "],["75.36","through you get kind of hungry the kids "],["76.74","are going to get kind of hungry oh look "],["78.18","well here's the food over in this "],["79.619","section over here we'll get a hot dog "],["81.479","and then you travel around and you go "],["83.28","okay well the kids

"],["101.159","that America you couldn't do that in "],["102.18","Ecuador because this Zoo uh is uh a hike "],["108.02","and um and a zoo all rolled up in one "],["111.78","it's all designed along this mountain "],["114.36","trail "],["115.439","so you paid your admission and you "],["117.24","started hiking up the hill on this "],["120.24","mountain trail and the entire Trail is "],["123.42","2.5 miles long and once you start "],["125.88","there's no exiting there's no shortcuts "],["129.36","to exhibits that you want to see you "],["131.22","just start hiking and whatever you come "],["133.26","across that's what you saw so a large "],["135.54","section for the animals fenced in or "],["137.94","enclosed behind the tigers and bears "],["140.099","were enclosed in a section they couldn't "],["142.08","get out the llamas and the deers and the "],["144.66","wild pigs they were more like a petting "],["146.58","zoo behind fences and they would come "],["148.02","right up and grub on you for food and "],["149.879","you could pet them "],["151.379","and sometimes the trail took you through "],["153.48","a series of doors that led you directly "],["156.48","into the exhibit yourself and now you "],["159.48","are part of the exhibits you are now in "],["161.879","the peacock cage you are now in the "],["164.28","monkey cage and uh they could come right "],["166.68","up to you and I wasn't trying to get "],["169.019","close to any monkeys oh look they're the "],["171.06","monkeys they're coming Friday let's get "],["172.739","out of here "],["174.3","I know I know monkey's climbing on me "],["177.239","and so that was very cool but the hiking "],["180.36","uphill in the high altitude of the Andes "],["183.42","well over 80 8 500 feet above sea level "],["186.3","was making this a bit challenging not to "],["189.9","mention "],["190.92","I was "],["192.659","attempting this while in the midst of "],["195.379","day three of a five-day bout of diarrhea "],["201.54","so I was kind of depleted "],["204.659","lacking of strength nevertheless I did "],["207.54","the entire Trail and I'm glad it did "],["209.28","being that close to Nature is beautiful "],["211.8","seeing God's creation and his creatures "],["214.92","and being 8 500 feet up was I was "],["218.04","literally very close to God "],["220.98","and as we look down at the city in the "],["223.5","valley it was truly a wonderful "],["225.06","experience walking that close to God and "],["227.04","all of his creation and that evening "],["228.78","after doing it all I thought I was going "],["231.659","to actually be taking home to be with "],["234.12","God "],["236.879","we got back to the house "],["238.799","I was exhausted "],["240.659","and uh we were supposed to go out again "],["242.819","that evening and meet some family but I "],["244.5","said I'm not feeling that good I think I "],["246.42","overdid it I'm staying in I think I'm "],["248.64","just tired so we took shower had a nice "],["251.459","supper and the family came over and we "],["253.56","visited and about 10 o'clock I said I'm "],["256.5","done said goodnight to everybody kissed "],["259.139","all the all the ants and went to bed "],["262.139","and I go upstairs to crash and and I'm "],["264.36","thinking I'll feel better in the morning "],["265.44","but you know oh my face is so hot "],["268.38","oh I did get a sunburned but I got a "],["271.44","headache and I I drank lots of water but "],["274.56","you know you can get dehydrated when "],["275.94","you're up in those high altitudes you "],["277.199","can get dehydrated and not even know it "],["278.699","and you know diarrhea will do that to "],["280.56","you you know you can see that and uh but "],["283.44","my I got this tightness in my chest "],["285.96","and and it won't go away "],["288.84","and now it's starting to concern me "],["290.88","because you know "],["292.259","I'm old "],["294.54","ever since Greg had that heart attack "],["296.34","I've been very leery on the possibility "],["298.139","that you know I could have been me and I "],["300.24","do have high cholesterol and my boys are "],["302.28","in their 20s and and I'm gonna act like "],["304.139","everything they can do I could do and "],["305.58","I'm ever going to let on that they're in "],["306.72","better shape than me but this tightness "],["308.46","isn't going away so I started thinking "],["312.419","what if this is it "],["313.979","what if I have a heart attack "],["316.74","and I die while I'm on vacation Ecuador "],["321.419","well that would be very inconvenient for "],["323.22","Eliana "],["325.68","it's definitely going to ruin vacation "],["327.36","for everyone "],["328.919","sorry to start talking to the Lord about "],["330.419","it and you know on the one hand I'm "],["332.4","ready spiritually to meet the Lord and "],["333.84","there's a part of me that wants to be in "],["335.28","heaven because I know that that will be "],["336.84","the most amazing place of all anything "],["339","awesome that I can think of doing here "],["341.039","on Earth anywhere as I think I'd like to "],["342.6","go or anything I think I'd like to do I "],["345.12","know what God has prepared is greater is "],["348","better but there's also part of me that "],["350.34","still wants to live and "],["352.62","I really don't want to ruin everybody's "],["353.94","vacation by dying "],["356.039","that would be kind of unthoughtful "],["359.34","I I don't want to overreact but it's not "],["361.44","a sharp pain it's not a stabbing pain I "],["363.78","don't think I got any numbness in my arm "],["365.1","but I'm hyper focusing on this pain and "],["367.1","I don't think I've ever had anything "],["369.419","like this before so you know this is "],["371.639","like two hours of me just laying in bed "],["373.919","thinking and thinking and thinking about "],["375.18","this and finally you know how to finally "],["377.22","gets over her visit and comes up to "],["378.72","check on her dying husband and "],["382.08","and I share my my thoughts and concerns "],["384.539","like I think I think I'm dying and she's "],["385.979","like you're not dying "],["388.319","hair take this pill drink some water "],["390","you're fine "],["391.56","and "],["392.94","sure enough she was right "],["394.8","an hour later I felt fine and it's a "],["397.38","great nurse you know "],["400.259","yeah she saved my life like I was "],["402.539","walking close to God that day but God "],["405.6","decided not to take me home just yeah "],["407.88","but there was a guy who walked with God "],["410.52","so closely one day God just took him "],["413.759","God just raptured him right up to heaven "],["416.22","and that was "],["417.919","Enoch our example of how to walk by "],["422.52","faith Hebrews chapter 11 turn into your "],["426.539","copy of Hebrews we continue our study "],["429.6","just to get the context verses one and "],["431.639","two now Faith is the Assurance of things "],["434.46","hoped for the conviction of Things Not "],["436.44","Seen for by it men of old gained "],["439.919","approval "],["441.3","and then last time we looked at the "],["444.78","example of

that this symbolic sacrifice "],["479.34","of Abel's lamb and all the Lambs of the "],["482.039","Old Testament was all foreshadowing of "],["484.68","the sacrifice of Christ Jesus that he "],["487.5","was going to make on the cross for all "],["489.12","of us Abel with his belief "],["492.78","his life showed us how to worship by "],["496.44","faith "],["497.58","Enoch who likewise did

"],["510.539","number five "],["511.8","by faith Enoch "],["514.14","was taken up so that he would not see "],["517.02","death and he was not found because God "],["519.659","took him up for he

biblical Enoch in Jude "],["614.339","chapter one can only be one because "],["616.26","there's only one chapter in Jude "],["617.94","verse 14 it was also about these men "],["621.06","that Enoch in the Seventh Generation "],["623.279","from Adam prophesied here's what Enoch "],["625.8","says behold the Lord came with many "],["628.019","thousands of his holy ones to execute "],["629.459","judgment upon all and to convict all of "],["631.26","ungodliness of all their ungodly deeds "],["632.88","and all that they've done in their "],["634.019","ungodly ways and of all the

"],["646.2","there is more to the story of Enoch than "],["648.24","we have recorded in our Bibles but all "],["650.7","that we can focus on since we're a Bible "],["652.74","Church is what our holy Bibles record "],["655.38","for us so that is found in Genesis "],["657.72","chapter five this is what we know about "],["659.22","Enoch okay Enoch "],["661.86","here's the word walked with God 300 "],["664.62","years after he became the father of "],["666.48","Methuselah and he had other sons and "],["668.16","daughters so all the days of Enoch were "],["670.019","365 years Enoch walked with

"],["687.48","walk with God the Hebrew word here is "],["690.3","halach "],["691.38","it is a word that is used well over 500 "],["694.68","times in the Bible in many different "],["696.839","contexts

mentioned in Genesis chapter "],["711.24","three this is the first time we have the "],["712.44","word walk and it is about God remember "],["715.32","Genesis 3 what's going on here this is "],["717.12","the story of Adam and Eve and they took "],["718.98","the fruit and ate that they weren't "],["720.06","supposed to and they saw oh we're naked "],["721.86","and they're hiding "],["723.36","and we hear in the narrative as they're "],["726.12","hiding they heard the sound of the Lord "],["727.86","God Walking In The Garden of the cool "],["729.36","evening and Adam and Eve hid themselves "],["731.82","from the presence of the Lord amongst "],["733.56","the trees and the Lord called out to the "],["735.66","man he said where are you "],["738.54","from this passage we conclude that this "],["741.779","was a regular occurrence Adam knew the "],["744.839","sound of God walking in the garden "],["746.22","because he had heard it before and the "],["748.62","fact that God called out to Adam because "],["750.6","Adam was hiding seems to imply that "],["752.88","normally Adam did not hide himself from "],["755.279","God when he walked in the garden so you "],["758.16","know we are taught in Sunday school that "],["760.14","God visited the garden and Adam and Eve "],["761.94","joined him on these walks and they "],["764.16","walked together but once Adam sinned the "],["767.279","walk "],["768.18","stops "],["770.04","and then we see in Genesis chapter 5 "],["772.38","Enoch walked with God and then we learn "],["774","in Genesis chapter six Noah walked with "],["776.88","God so does this mean like you know in "],["780","the garden it's a it's a theophany I'm "],["782.459","pre-incarnated appearing of the second "],["783.779","person of the

"],["794.519","lighthouse and Piney Point you know get "],["796.86","some exercise you know I mean why don't "],["798.12","we should invite God to join us someday "],["800.339","you know like maybe he could stretch his "],["801.959","legs a little bit and he could what does "],["803.76","it mean to walk with God "],["807","says in Genesis chapter 6 about Noah "],["809.279","that uh Noah was a righteous man "],["811.56","blameless "],["812.88","in his time and Noah walked with God "],["816.06","and so some details there so it seems "],["818.94","like in Genesis Enoch and Noah are the "],["822.36","exceptions compared to everybody else in "],["823.92","their time notably they walk with God "],["826.38","and nobody else has ever described as "],["828.12","doing so so this must be a very rare "],["831.899","only spiritually Elite people can do "],["835.74","this well wait a sec now it also tells "],["837.899","us in Genesis 48 that uh as Israel is "],["842.399","blessing his sons he says to Joseph the "],["844.98","Lord whom before your fathers Abraham "],["846.779","and Isaac walked "],["848.279","oh they walked with him too "],["850.68","and uh then Moses tells the entire "],["853.32","nation of Israel in Deuteronomy 28 the "],["856.079","Lord will establish you as a holy people "],["858.06","to himself as he swore to you if you "],["860.279","keep my Commandments of the Lord your "],["861.839","God and "],["863.22","walk in his ways "],["865.62","so it's it's not all that Elites matter "],["868.98","of fact it seems like from Deuteronomy "],["870.899","28 it's expected and required of Israel "],["873.66","God's chosen people all of them "],["876.36","to walk in his ways "],["878.339","and then once again the psalmist says "],["880.32","how blessed are those whose way is "],["882.66","blameless who "],["884.22","walk in the law of the Lord how blessed "],["886.8","are those who observe his testimonies "],["888.779","who seek him with their heart that they "],["891.6","do not unrighteousness and in contrast "],["894.48","they "],["895.86","walk in his ways so this is something "],["898.44","we're all supposed to be doing Enoch "],["900.48","apparently was the first guy to do it in "],["901.98","a manner that was noteworthy the word "],["904.079","walk is the biblical expression for "],["907.68","Fellowship in obedience with God that

last week Hebrews chapter 11 "],["29.76","verse 1 learning that faith is the "],["31.679","Assurance of things hoped for the "],["33.54","convictions of not Things Not Seen "],["36.66","for by it men of old gained approval and "],["39.84","then I told you we're going to walk "],["41.1","through all of these examples of people "],["44.16","who are living by faith so that's what "],["47.579","we're going to start now in uh verse "],["50.039","number four by faith Abel offered to God "],["54.12","a better sacrifice than Cain "],["56.64","through which he obtained the testimony "],["58.92","that he was righteous God testifying "],["61.5","about his gifts and through faith though "],["63.899","he is dead he still speaks I thought it "],["67.38","was interesting that Abel is the first "],["69.06","person spoken of in the by faith chapter "],["72.78","Adam the first man is not mentioned "],["75.6","apparently he did not have any notable "],["78.24","big moments of Faith to Showcase he "],["80.4","makes the list of the biggest Act of "],["82.5","Disobedience for sure the original sin "],["84.72","of mankind comes from Adam "],["87.54","but uh Abel gets the distinction of "],["90.119","being the first mentioned on the by "],["92.22","faith list I I guess I find it "],["94.799","interesting because I don't typically "],["96.6","think of Abel as being on the Mount "],["99.6","Rushmore of biblical heroes in the Old "],["102.6","Testament you'd maybe jump to Abraham "],["105","Moses David or Daniel those would be "],["108.119","some of my favorites Abel only has a "],["112.14","moment to live his name actually in "],["114.78","Hebrew means breath and that's about as "],["117.119","long as he lasted brevity is how we "],["120.54","would describe Abel his life was so "],["122.88","short but that what that fact does not "],["125.88","disqualify him from the by faith list "],["127.88","quality of life versus quantity is "],["131.52","something we can consider in our "],["133.02","observations of Abel I think we all "],["135.599","would say Quantity of life is a priority "],["138.84","I would like as much life as possible a "],["142.319","good long life so that I can do all the "],["144.9","things I want to do and enjoy the people "],["146.819","that I love for as long as possible but "],["149.34","there is no guarantees of that so it's "],["151.98","wise to make the most of the life that "],["155.28","you do have "],["156.54","the Latin Carpe Diem Seize the Day don't "],["160.92","waste your time you may not have as much "],["163.56","as it as you think it's sad to see some "],["166.92","people wasting the amount of time that "],["169.319","they do have what good is quantity of "],["172.26","life if you're spending it laying on the "],["175.019","couch wallowing in self-pity "],["177.9","people procrastinate tackling important "],["180.42","issues or initiating their big Ideas the "],["183.72","problem with that is most of those "],["186","Visions require growth and development "],["188.94","and investment of time and energy and "],["191.879","the longer you drag your feet to get "],["193.739","started the longer it takes to "],["196.319","accomplish them in the younger years "],["198.72","Ileana from time to time would bring up "],["200.7","the idea of me hey Rob you should go "],["203.34","back to Seminary and work on a masters "],["204.84","and I would shoot that idea down for "],["206.94","like 10 years I did a little bit of "],["209.28","distance learning in that time but "],["210.78","finally I got with the program and when "],["213.12","I was 33 I went back to school and got "],["215.879","that Masters thing done by age 36. but "],["219.36","even if you feel I've waited too long "],["220.98","you know you were still young in your "],["222.299","30s don't talk yourself out of your "],["224.28","dreams Eliana learned her Masters when "],["226.799","she was 50. so she had that goal and she "],["230.159","got at it and got it done this is the "],["233.159","time to get at it to start working on a "],["236.879","goal maybe start that exercise routine "],["239.34","or start that job search or register for "],["242.04","those classes sign up for those lessons "],["244.86","this is the week two break a bad habit "],["247.98","maybe join a support group this is the "],["250.26","week two declutter your life or take a "],["252.9","moral inventory reorient your life and "],["256.44","above all else I know for a fact this is "],["259.739","the time to trust in the Lord Paul "],["263.04","writes in second Corinthians for he has "],["265.74","he says at a favorable time I listen to "],["269.58","you and on a day of salvation I helped "],["272.94","you Paul says behold now is a favorable "],["275.759","time now is the day of salvation now "],["280.02","I'll be honest with you I have wasted a "],["282.3","lot of time "],["283.32","in my life not being very productive I "],["286.199","really like music I could have learned a "],["288.18","musical instrument in the last 52 years "],["289.86","I didn't bother with that I could have "],["291.6","picked up some practical skills maybe "],["293.4","got some mechanical skills that that "],["295.259","would save me a little bit of time and "],["297.3","frustration and money if I learned how "],["299.34","to work on my own car clearly it would "],["301.8","have been more useful than a Fantasy "],["303.54","Football Championship got a couple of "],["305.94","those those aren't paying me a dime you "],["308.16","know maybe some investment or financial "],["309.86","skills would have been helpful or some "],["312.24","tech skills would have been good but the "],["314.04","one thing I did get straightened out on "],["317.16","early in life I learned to trust in "],["321.12","Jesus I didn't procrastinate on that one "],["324","and you don't need to either "],["326.78","now is the day of salvation it's such a "],["330.84","short trip back to God you know part of "],["333.96","the reason why it took me so long to get "],["335.16","at the Masters is oh it's going to take "],["336.78","so long it's going to take three years "],["338.52","but you know what getting back with God "],["340.8","is this quick "],["342.9","that's how quick it is "],["344.639","it doesn't have to be three years of "],["346.68","study it can just be a simple act that "],["349.62","you do even today "],["352.32","that's how long it takes "],["354.539","you don't know how much time "],["357.6","you have in this life "],["359.759","just like Abel our lives are a breath of "],["363.36","vapor just a moment so get right with "],["366.84","Jesus now this is a day "],["370.199","to take a step of Faith so let's take a "],["373.02","moment and look at Abel's short life and "],["376.8","turn to Genesis chapter 4 as this is "],["379.56","where we find "],["381.84","his whole life "],["383.4","in "],["384.66","eight verses Genesis chapter 4 verse 1. "],["388.919","speaking of the first man Adam "],["391.139","had relations with his wife Eve they "],["394.8","conceived and gave birth to Cain "],["397.259","and she said I have gotten a man-child "],["399.6","with the help of the Lord "],["401.46","chapter 4 verse 2 again she gave birth "],["403.56","to his brother Abel and Abel was a "],["407.28","keeper of flocks but Cain was a tiller "],["409.979","of the ground "],["411.479","so it came about in the course of time "],["413.4","that came brought an offering to the "],["415.74","lord of the fruits of the ground Abel on "],["418.44","his part also brought of the first Lings "],["421.74","of his flock and of the fat portions and "],["425.22","the Lord had regard for Abel and for his "],["429.66","offering but for Cain and for his "],["432.419","offering the Lord had no regard "],["435.539","so Cain became very angry in his "],["439.56","countenance fell and the Lord said to "],["441.9","Cain why are you angry why is your "],["444.36","countenance Fallen if you do well will "],["447.3","not your countenance be lifted up and if "],["449.34","you do not do well "],["451.08","sin is crouching at the door and its "],["454.259","desire is for you but you must Master it "],["458.16","Cain told Abel his brother and he came "],["460.5","about when they were in the field that "],["462.479","Cain rose up against Abel his brother "],["464.66","and killed him "],["467.4","and that's the story of Abel right there "],["470.52","very short "],["472.02","so see why I think it's interesting that "],["474.419","he's like the first big person of faith "],["476.699","uh it says here that the Lord had regard "],["481.02","for Abel's offering and that Hebrew word "],["483.12","regard is all it means to look to gaze "],["487.259","at in contrast God had no regard for "],["492.06","Cain's offering God disregarded Cain's "],["495.9","offering so the author of Hebrews tells "],["498.36","us Abel's sacrifice affirmed attested "],["503.16","bore witness to the fact that he was "],["505.259","righteous and God saw Abel as righteous "],["508.379","God saw his sacrifice and God saw Abel "],["512.459","as righteous his sacrifice being an Act "],["515.459","of Faith meanwhile Keynes was not "],["519.539","so it says here in chapter 11 Hebrews "],["522.779","chapter 11 verse 4. uh one more time "],["527.279","by faith Abel offered to God a better "],["531.06","sacrifice than Cain there's one of our "],["534.12","key words in the book of Hebrews what is "],["536.64","it "],["537.42","better "],["539.16","able sacrifice is better so what was his "],["542.399","sacrifice and "],["545.04","why is it better "],["546.6","when Adam and Eve sinned they uh ice "],["550.38","were opened up to the fact that they "],["551.94","were naked what and uh they quickly "],["554.94","grabbed some fig leaves and sewed them "],["557.16","together right and that really didn't "],["560.1","work too good so after the Lord had "],["562.98","handed out the curses for sin it says in "],["565.92","chapter 3 verse 21 that the Lord made "],["568.68","garments from the skin of an animal uh "],["572.04","and used that for Adam and Eve for "],["573.72","clothing God killed some animals and "],["576.18","then made Adam and Eve clothing with the "],["578.519","Skins so this is the first death as a "],["582.3","result of the curse some animals had to "],["584.76","die so their skins could be a covering "],["587.82","but also most people would conclude that "],["590.279","this is the beginning of the animal "],["591.899","sacrificial system as a way of staving "],["596.1","off death for sin the animal is "],["599.279","substituted in the place of the "],["601.08","individual "],["602.279","not that that is explained in Genesis "],["604.5","chapter 3 but it is the theme of animal "],["607.58","sacrifices is all through a Genesis and "],["610.14","then when we get to the Books of Moses "],["612","uh Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy "],["614.339","it's spelled out specifically all the "],["616.44","details of the law of those sacrifices "],["618.66","anyways in Genesis chapter 4 the story "],["621.54","of Cain and Abel we see that Cain is a "],["624.12","what's he do for a living he's a "],["626.339","gardener and Abel is a Shepherd a keeper "],["629.88","of flocks both come with a sacrifice to "],["633.12","the Lord Abel brings the best lamb of "],["636.36","his flock and Cain brings the fruit of "],["639.48","the ground "],["640.8","now with regards to Kane's offering "],["643.98","there is a time and a place "],["648","in the law of Moses for grain offerings "],["650.64","and first fruit offerings first fruits "],["653.64","in the Jewish feast is uh held in early "],["656.88","spring it's this particular Feast uh at "],["659.76","the beginning of the grain Harvest first "],["661.8","fruits is the time to give thanks to God "],["664.2","for his Provisions our Thanksgiving Horn "],["667.079","of Plenty as I have one up here is uh is "],["670.5","the imagery that reflects that ancient "],["672.18","custom look at all this abundance we "],["675.3","praise the god of creation for blessing "],["677.82","the Lamb with this bounty of food that "],["680.1","we are enjoying here at the Harvest Time "],["682.22","likewise we often see in Scripture that "],["686.04","famine is a punishment from God as a way "],["690","of showing people he is displeased with "],["692.22","them so that would be something I would "],["694.26","recommend you pay attention to in 2023 "],["696.24","watch over food shortages and reports of "],["699.42","famine and I recommend you make friends "],["701.76","with some person with chickens because "],["704.6","eggs are Priceless right now "],["708","so don't miss the significance of that "],["709.5","okay but in Leviticus chapter 23 uh the "],["712.74","law of Moses instituted the first fruits "],["714.72","offerings that people were to bring a "],["716.76","sheath of grain to the priest and he "],["719.04","would wave it before the Lord and a "],["721.019","burnt offering and a meal offering and "],["722.76","then a drink offering we're also "],["724.8","required at that time no grain was to be "],["727.14","harvested until the first fruit offering "],["729.42","was brought to the Lord so you made the "],["731.64","first harvest first fruits and you made "],["733.92","that offering and then once you did that "],["736.2","you could go harvest the rest of your "],["737.82","field the offering was made to in "],["740.279","remembrance of "],["742.22","Israel's "],["744","time of slavery in Egypt how the Lord "],["747.42","delivered them out of that and then how "],["749.82","he led them into the promised land and "],["752.339","they could possess this land flowing of "],["754.079","milk and honey and all this bounty so "],["756.36","it's an act of illustrating thankfulness "],["758.88","and gratitude and even today we practice "],["762.66","a form of this in our giving of tithes "],["765.06","and offerings during our service this is "],["767.519","an act of faith and we kind of say you "],["769.32","know I give this portion of my paycheck "],["771.24","back to you God to communicate that I'm "],["774.06","trusting in you and not myself not my "],["776.7","money to meet my needs I give this "],["779.1","portion back to God to be used to the "],["781.32","building of his kingdom this gift is "],["783.6","used for the further until the gospel "],["785.1","where herein "],["787.44","all right you've learned my little "],["789","saying haven't you you've heard that "],["790.5","enough times so giving a first fruits

"],["1527.659","so then afterwards I'm like well I want "],["1529.58","to take communion and my mother's like "],["1531.44","okay well why do you want to take "],["1532.4","communion I was like well "],["1534.86","I really like grape juice "],["1537.38","and I'm always hungry at church "],["1539.6","being a nice snack "],["1541.7","and my mom said "],["1543.74","that's not what it's for it's not

"],["1745.4","will once again be time for a change "],["1748.279","it'll be time to grow in our faith with "],["1751.159","new revelation so this is what we learn "],["1753.679","from the short life

College "],["34.32","play basketball right yeah somebody had "],["36.12","heard this story before I went to Bible "],["38.219","College because they said I could play "],["39.719","on the basketball team uh well I could "],["42","be on the team this is where the story "],["44.1","is interesting so my freshman year as "],["46.92","often is the case with freshman I was "],["49.079","riding the pie I rarely ever got in the "],["52.62","game and rightfully so uh being "],["55.02","completely honest I was you know I know "],["56.94","you'll find this hard to believe but I "],["57.96","was one of the smaller guys on the team "],["59.66","and uh also one of the least skilled in "],["62.94","one of the least athletic and as I "],["65.159","looked at everybody else I could plainly "],["66.84","see hey that's the facts and at the end "],["69.06","of the year the coach told me he said "],["70.799","well we've recruited some new players "],["73.159","probably your situation is not going to "],["76.14","be any different next year which is "],["78","being brutally honest according to him "],["80.1","didn't look like I was going to be "],["81.299","playing much my sophomore year and not "],["83.759","just me but there were several of us on "],["85.5","the team that was going to be true of so "],["87.18","the next year there was probably six of "],["88.92","us who didn't bother to go back out and "],["92.1","uh try out for the team and sure enough "],["94.08","there was a new batch of recruited "],["95.759","freshmen they came in and as foretold "],["98.579","they were better than me and I wouldn't "],["101.7","have had much of a chance of playing "],["102.96","well good thing I quit "],["105.84","I didn't have to waste my time being on "],["108.9","that team that wasn't going to play but "],["111.18","here's the thing "],["112.32","you know what guaranteed that I wouldn't "],["114.06","be playing any basketball at all "],["116.7","quitting quitting the team did not spare "],["119.759","me from not playing quitting the team "],["121.74","absolutely guaranteed I would not ever "],["124.92","be playing "],["126.96","so I doomed myself "],["129.179","in the the fall uh of that sophomore "],["132.3","year it didn't seem like there would be "],["134.16","any chance I would have played so I just "],["136.739","uh instead of putting myself through "],["137.94","that aggravation I went across the "],["140.64","street and I coached at a little "],["142.44","Christian School coach to high school "],["144.239","basketball that was a lot of fun played "],["145.98","a ball in practice with the kids and "],["148.14","that kind of scratched my basketball "],["149.76","itch but you know what I hadn't "],["152.16","considered though my freshman year the "],["154.379","team was full of a lot of Juniors and "],["156","seniors and they were good students and "],["158.16","very kind of mature guys but all these "],["160.319","freshmen that came in the next year they "],["162.36","were good athletes they were horrible "],["164.64","students and after one semester a couple "],["167.819","of the better ball players were on "],["169.8","academic probation "],["171.78","and then there were some injuries so "],["174.3","Midway through that second semester my "],["176.819","chances would have been quite a bit "],["178.26","higher of playing "],["180.72","if I hadn't quit says it already quit "],["182.879","too late "],["184.379","my junior year rolls around and I "],["186.06","thought about playing once again I "],["188.04","evaluated who was coming back and I said "],["189.84","ah I won't play I'll just go coach the "],["192.72","team across the across the street again "],["195.12","now the funny thing that happened that "],["196.8","year is the coach quit so he quit and "],["201.78","then there was a lot of players didn't "],["203.459","come back and there was a new coach and "],["205.14","then I would go to the gym and and play "],["207.42","with those guys uh in some pickup ball "],["209.879","and I realized you know I've gotten uh "],["212.7","I've gotten a little bit bigger and I'm "],["214.44","faster than I was my freshman year and "],["216.42","In This Crowd they're not really that "],["218.22","good and and since I've been coaching "],["220.319","high school kids I I've been working on "],["223.019","it more and I I'd gotten a lot better "],["224.879","and then my junior year in the second "],["227.04","semester once again another round of bad "],["230.159","grades resulting in academic probation "],["232.26","for some Knuckleheads and another round "],["234.239","of injuries and then I was looking at "],["236.159","the team that was starting and I thought "],["238.56","I'm better than these Jokers I could "],["241.5","have been starting if I hadn't have "],["245.879","quit "],["247.26","I went to college because I wanted to "],["248.819","play basketball and I didn't play any "],["251.22","basketball "],["252.239","because I quit now here's a weird thing "],["254.58","John Evans who is the president of good "],["256.979","news prison Ministries who spoke here "],["260.04","last year at that time when I went to "],["262.38","school he was a junior and he was the "],["263.82","captain of the soccer team so he "],["265.44","convinced me my freshman year you should "],["268.259","come out and play soccer and so I did "],["270.78","but likewise I rode the pine and I "],["273.54","didn't get in that much my sophomore "],["275.4","year he said ah mcnut we're really going "],["277.08","to need you this year you got to come "],["278.04","back so I did I didn't start but I I "],["281.52","played more that year and I played every "],["284.699","year of college I played soccer and it "],["287.28","ended up my senior year I was the "],["289.979","captain of the team and at the end of "],["292.56","the the school year when the school had "],["294.78","its um its athletic award banquet and "],["297.78","they were giving out sports awards uh "],["300.36","every year they would give a senior the "],["304.199","male athlete of the Year award and they "],["305.94","give a senior gal the female at the Year "],["307.68","award and my year they gave me the male "],["310.979","athlete of the Year award and it wasn't "],["314.28","because I was the best athlete in school "],["315.84","it's because I was the last senior "],["318.6","standing of all the guys that came in my "],["321.479","freshman year who were so good they had "],["323.699","all quit and they'd all dropped out of "],["326.759","college and so I learned a very valuable "],["329.22","lesson from my college sports days I "],["332.4","learned from my basketball failures and "],["335.1","I learned from my soccer successes I "],["337.919","learned that if you try you might "],["339.96","struggle you might suck it may not work "],["342.419","out the way you want but if you quit you "],["346.08","most definitely will fail if you stay at "],["349.199","it and struggle and endure even if "],["351.96","there's a slim chance there is a chance "],["354","you will succeed "],["356.4","if you don't quit "],["358.02","and that's how I managed to earn a "],["360.66","couple of degrees "],["362.699","despite being a very bad student exam "],["366.12","time would come exam time and during the "],["368.639","year and no matter how bad I thought I "],["370.68","was going to do I go in there and I take "],["373.62","those tests and I just somehow "],["376.8","some miracle just kept passing them and "],["380.1","that's how I've managed to stay in the "],["381.419","ministry for the last 30 years no matter "],["383.759","what tests have come my way no matter "],["385.979","what I've had to deal with I just keep "],["388.08","plugging away and somehow some way God "],["391.139","has seen me through so maybe you're here "],["393.479","today and you're thinking about quitting "],["396.78","well this is definitely a message for "],["399.24","people who are having a crisis of Faith "],["402.72","people who are tempted to doubt God his "],["406.139","will his plans his purposes for your "],["408.6","life his words and his Declarations of "],["411.539","what is right and what is true Jesus "],["414.419","said I am the way well I'm not so sure "],["416.88","about that what has he done to prove to "],["418.979","me that I can trust him where are all of "],["421.68","his blessings turn to Hebrews chapter "],["424.38","10. I know I know you thought we "],["427.44","finished Hebrews last week well there's "],["430.08","just a little bit of more work we got to "],["431.639","do in there verse 35 Hebrews 10 35 "],["435.38","therefore do not throw away your "],["438.479","confidence which has a great reward for "],["441.78","you have need of endurance so that when "],["444.96","you have done the will of God you may "],["447.06","receive what was promised for yet in a "],["451.139","very little while he who is coming will "],["453.66","come and will not delay but my right "],["456.72","righteous one shall live by faith and if "],["461.22","he shrinks back my soul has no pleasure "],["463.8","in him but we are not of those who "],["467.16","shrink back to destruction but of those "],["469.44","who have faith to "],["471.72","the preserving of the Soul "],["474.72","the tactic of retreating or quitting "],["477.419","happens when someone thinks they're "],["479.52","going to fail or lose and instead of "],["481.8","experiencing the pain and the suffering "],["483.479","of failing they Retreat to survive they "],["486.419","shrink back to avoid whatever the test "],["488.58","or task is because they think it will be "],["491.88","better for them to do that than to have "],["495.419","to bear it but many times the shrinking "],["498.599","back the quitting only results in what "],["501.06","they're trying to avoid in the first "],["502.259","place failure loss and destruction so "],["505.56","the audience here in Hebrews is losing "],["507.72","their confidence they have suffered "],["509.94","reproach and tribulation they have lost "],["512.219","property and relationships and perhaps "],["515.099","they're feeling a bit of a loss of "],["516.659","identity a loss of culture and Heritage "],["519.24","and they're scratching their heads "],["520.8","wondering for what Jesus was here at "],["525.6","this point 35 years ago and he said he "],["529.2","was coming back and it's been over 30 "],["530.82","years now and where is he "],["534.3","you ever get tired of waiting "],["536.7","impatient with the process what's the "],["540.12","point of this trial God why do I have to "],["542.76","continue to suffer verse 35 therefore do "],["547.56","not throw away your confidence which is "],["549.839","of great reward for you have need of "],["553.2","endurance so that when you've done the "],["555.3","will of God you may receive what was "],["558.36","promised when you've done the will of "],["560.7","God "],["562.08","you will receive what is Promised okay

"],["593.279","will is not a particular task or event "],["596.399","or accomplishment or assignment it is "],["598.98","simply to "],["600.6","live by "],["603.36","Faith to not lose your confidence

still kicking around here today "],["1530.659","you know and who gets healed from "],["1532.52","cirrhosis of the liver right "],["1535.1","remember two weeks ago how young Eli's "],["1538.46","mom

"],["1546.799","go to this specialist and we prayed and "],["1549.38","then last week his mom reported uh took "],["1552.74","him to the doctor and the doctor said "],["1554.84","that's fine "],["1556.76","everything's good "],["1559.279","remember when covet hit and everything "],["1561.38","shut down in the country and many "],["1562.82","churches lost their people and and "],["1564.799","weren't able to get their doors open "],["1566.12","again but we on the other hand what "],["1567.98","happened to us we paid off a big loan "],["1570.74","remember when Bobby came

healed him of that and then "],["1580.76","brought him back and he got through the "],["1582.08","cancer and he got to finish the whole "],["1583.279","plan remember that "],["1585.44","remember when will was a big fat lying "],["1588.08","drug addict but the Holy Spirit pulled "],["1589.7","that evil spirit of addiction out of him "],["1591.679","and and changed him and is a wonderful "],["1594.02","Christian man as soon as in our church "],["1595.34","remember when Tom was trapped in "],["1597.559","adultery and porn and he turned to God "],["1599.72","for help and it saved Tom and Michelle's "],["1601.4","marriage and hell and then I worked full "],["1603.2","time here for people saving marriages "],["1605.539","here and all over the world remember "],["1607.52","when Mike

my friends were going now "],["455.58","funny thing even though I grew up in the "],["457.44","great white North never been skiing in "],["459.599","my life my parents to my knowledge never "],["462.18","went skiing it's uh it's kind of "],["464.819","expensive you you got to have all this "],["466.56","equipment and if you don't have it you "],["467.759","got to rent it and uh it's also you ski "],["471.18","in the "],["472.259","winter and it's always very cold in "],["474.78","Canada in the winter and it's a sport "],["476.46","and two things my mother doesn't like "],["478.759","cold and sports so she wasn't interested "],["482.16","in either one of that but uh "],["484.139","nevertheless and I was in seventh grade "],["486.24","I wanted to go and they said sure go "],["488.759","ahead so we met at the church at "],["490.5","Saturday early in the morning drove two "],["493.02","hours to crab Mountain to ski for the "],["496.02","whole day "],["496.979","and we get there and you spend the first "],["499.319","hour just going through the line and "],["502.319","getting your equipment you got to get "],["504.12","your poles you got to get your skis and "],["505.56","you got to get your boots and then "],["506.759","you're going to get your lift ticket and "],["508.379","they give you all this gear and they say "],["510.479","good luck you know don't try to try not "],["512.94","to kill yourself or anyone else "],["514.56","have fun and out you go so the first "],["518.58","thing you got to figure out are the "],["521.339","boots anybody skied you know these boots "],["523.56","are like okay these boots you strap them "],["526.74","to your feet and then you cannot bend "],["529.26","your ankles you you you have to just "],["531.779","Clump with them so but that's not a big "],["534.3","deal because uh you know I grew up "],["536.519","skating so I understand that there's "],["538.68","certain type of Footwear you wear for "],["540.18","different type of sports and you can't "],["541.74","walk in skates either so they really "],["543.72","don't work until you get on the ice and "],["545.76","then they work great so I understand "],["546.959","this that's not a problem get those on I "],["549.42","Clump outside with my poles and my skis "],["552.36","and they showed you inside okay here's "],["554.519","how you put these things on you you kick "],["556.2","the toe in here and you stomp down there "],["557.76","and then you're locked in you do that "],["559.92","here and then you're locked into your "],["561.72","skis and now you're ready to go but then "],["563.94","once you're in those things you got to "],["565.62","figure out how to move you know because "],["567.54","you're not on a hill you're just "],["568.98","standing there on the ground and it's "],["570.6","it's not really intuitive you know you "],["572.399","can't walk in them so you kind of have "],["574.019","to slide item pull and slide and when "],["577.019","you first get in them the first thing "],["578.58","you do is you you yeah and you fall down "],["581.899","and you're laying on the ground and uh "],["585.42","that's good because "],["587.399","you're going to do that all day "],["590.94","and the first thing you got to learn "],["592.56","about skiing is how to get up okay so "],["596.279","you're laying there and you got you know "],["598.32","you got this pull the skis and the poles "],["600.72","and you got to figure out how to you "],["602.22","know get your get them together because "],["604.08","you can't do it like this you got to get "],["605.339","them like this and then you know and "],["607.62","when you're overweight it's really hard "],["608.94","you know so "],["610.62","fortunately I was a teenager now I'm 52 "],["612.839","and I can't even get up like this "],["613.98","without you you get up and and then "],["617.1","you're up and it's like okay and that's "],["618.839","the first lesson and you do that about "],["620.76","three times "],["622.14","just getting to the Bunny Hill and they "],["624.36","say go to the Bunny Hill and you go to "],["626.1","the Bunny Hill and then at the Bunny "],["627.36","Hill uh the the the the the ski slope "],["630.839","has the chair left you know where you "],["632.459","sit down and you cruise up the "],["634.019","Mountainside not at the Bunny Hill they "],["636","just give you a rope and uh it's just on "],["638.88","a pulley and it just keeps going so you "],["640.68","just you know you you get up there and "],["643.019","you're supposed to grab this handle and "],["645.12","as soon as you grab the handle guess "],["646.44","what happens it pulls you and you fall "],["649.14","down and then you're laying there like a "],["651.839","turtle on his back and there's all these "],["653.88","people in line going who's this idiot "],["656.279","and and they're waiting so you gotta "],["658.56","roll out and do that again and get to "],["660.54","the back of the line to try again and "],["662.579","then halfway up the Buddy Hill you fall "],["664.56","again and then you gotta now there's a "],["666.6","line of people coming behind you they're "],["667.86","gonna run over you and back up and fall "],["669.779","so you roll out and finally you get to "],["672.24","the Bunny Hill "],["673.26","and uh I'm gonna ski okay this is cool "],["676.8","I'm gonna ski so what do you do you just "],["678.72","point yourself and go right just slide "],["680.339","down the hill because I've sledded my "],["682.62","whole life and sledding is fun but in "],["684.959","sledding you sit on your bomb and uh you "],["687.3","just sit there well guess what skiing is "],["689.04","a whole different world and it's much "],["690.3","faster so if you lean back too much you "],["693.42","fall and if you lean one way you spin "],["695.82","around and you fall and if you get your "],["697.56","skis crossed you fall and uh that's what "],["700.92","that's what I did for three hours I just "],["704.16","went five feet and fell six feet and "],["706.68","fell and finally I got going like I'm "],["709.2","doing it and now I'm getting to the "],["710.76","bottom of the hill and it's like how do "],["712.44","you stop thank you "],["714.14","oh oh well I don't know how to stop in "],["717.3","these things so you either run into "],["719.04","people the lodge or you "],["721.14","you fall and guess what I did I fell so "],["724.26","I did that for three hours "],["725.94","and that lunch I took a break and went "],["727.98","inside and ate a poutine and then I was "],["731.7","like okay "],["733.079","I've been on the Bunny Hill all morning "],["735.48","and I'm done with this I'm going to the "],["739.26","big hill "],["740.22","and so I went out and I got to this "],["744.42","chair lift and I you guessed it fell "],["747.839","getting on the chairlift and I fell "],["750.3","getting off the chairlift and then I "],["752.459","went to the big hill and I fell going "],["755.22","down that hill all the way down I wiped "],["759.18","out so bad one one of those runs my "],["761.339","poles went flying my skis went flying my "],["763.92","hat went flying and I spent 10 minutes "],["765.899","just staggering around trying to you try "],["769.019","to put the skis on and not go down the "],["770.82","hill because you're on the hill you're "],["771.899","trying to get them on and then you just "],["773.76","so I got him on and I went 20 more yards "],["776.16","and wiped out again and that was that "],["778.56","was the whole day "],["779.639","and uh but you know what it just kept at "],["782.16","that and uh by the evening and the night "],["784.68","skiing guess what "],["786.06","I was skiing I could go up the lift and "],["789.779","I could get off and I could go down the "],["791.639","hill and I was one of the best days of "],["793.74","my life "],["795.24","and I went skiing every year after that "],["797.339","with my youth group and then when I came "],["799.62","down here to college we were at "],["801.66","Washington barber college and we went up "],["803.1","to Pennsylvania and we skied up there "],["805.56","and I skied different Hills and then "],["807.06","when I became a youth pastor I used to "],["808.86","take the youth group skiing every year "],["810.42","we would go and I would ski and I was "],["814.139","good at it and then in 2000 we moved and "],["818.279","I never

Hill and all that so "],["839.16","I went out there got my skis and and got "],["841.68","up there and sure enough it all came "],["844.139","back to me and I could ski no problem "],["846.42","maybe I fell once or twice no don't tell "],["849.36","and uh "],["851.04","we won't talk about anybody else to "],["852.48","skiing and then uh then we did it again "],["855.12","last year we went again

this new "],["98.64","children's ministry called awara "],["101.759","it was on Monday nights at the local "],["104.4","elementary school in 1979 I was in third "],["107.759","grade that was the

ever seen kids with these cool "],["123.6","uniforms and as they completed sections "],["126.299","in their workbooks they would be awarded "],["128.22","patches and badges and medals to wear on "],["130.979","their uniforms the sections that they "],["133.379","would complete in their workbooks to "],["134.819","earn the badges were of course "],["137.06","verses they were scripture that you were "],["139.86","to memorize and I never seen anything "],["142.44","like this in my life so this picture "],["144.36","right here this was uh one I found on "],["146.4","the internet but that little guy in the "],["147.72","middle that is what the original Awana "],["150.379","uniforms look like the gray shirts with "],["153.48","the red uh scarves and then you could "],["156.18","see he's

"],["164.16","definitely cool just like that guy right "],["167.22","there "],["168.12","is uh uh but you could tell just by "],["171.239","looking at uniform hey that's kind of "],["172.739","modeled off of the the Boy Scouts and "],["174.84","the Cub Scouts right you know the whole "],["176.4","gray shirt uh Red Scarf thing after all "],["179.16","Awana is a american-based program so the "],["183.54","American culture was definitely "],["184.739","influencing uh and was obvious "],["186.959","especially those flag ceremonies in the "],["189.78","pledges that wasn't something I'd ever "],["191.22","seen in my life and since we were in "],["192.9","Canada we weren't gonna pledge to the "],["194.76","American flag but Canada doesn't have an "],["196.92","official flag pledge but fortunately our "],["200.28","our local Province had come up with one "],["202.56","so we used that one instead "],["205.379","and uh but it was also where I also "],["208.62","learned the uh pledge to the Christian "],["210.599","Flag for the first time I pledge "],["212.519","allegiance to the Christian flag and to "],["215.22","the Savior for whose kingdom it stands "],["217.08","one savior crucified risen and coming "],["220.319","again life and Liberty to all who "],["223.019","believe and then I learned the pledge to "],["225.06","the Bible I pledge allegiance to the "],["226.319","Bible God's holy word I'll make it a "],["228.72","lamp unto my feet and a light under my "],["230.64","path I will hide its word in my heart "],["232.739","that I will not sin against

entire life I learned "],["246.599","them in third grade and I never forgot "],["248.64","them fond memories I had and great "],["251.28","respect I have for the Awana program so "],["253.62","anyways when I went to Bible College we "],["255.659","were supposed to do a Christian Ministry "],["258.359","every semester we had to once a week "],["260.34","have this Christian Ministry practical "],["262.26","work so I signed up at the local church "],["264.66","for the Awana program program because I "],["266.4","knew all about that and that was fun "],["268.56","yelling at kids and then when we come "],["271.74","back down here to the States from Canada "],["273.78","our church in Virginia had Awana so we "],["276.18","signed our boys up and they went into "],["277.56","the Awana program and then we moved down "],["279.3","here to Faith Bible Church same thing "],["280.919","Dave Mason and the crew holding it down "],["283.259","with Awana so we signed our boys up and "],["285.24","we signed up and we were once again "],["287.759","resumed yelling at kids "],["290.28","um so but those pledges as I think back "],["294","on them "],["295.32","I think they really impacted me "],["297.72","I remember my father would take us to do "],["301.44","Bible camps in the summer and lots of "],["304.08","times they were in northern Maine and we "],["305.759","go to these Bible camps in the woods "],["307.38","with all the bugs and uh we would uh go "],["310.5","there for a week long because he was the "],["312.36","speaker and I was a camper and they "],["314.34","would get us up at the crack of dawn to "],["317.22","jog to the flagpole and we would run to "],["320.1","the flagpole in the morning and then we "],["322.259","would do we'd do some exercises and we'd "],["325.02","do some calisthenics to get the blood "],["326.759","going and then every morning we do our "],["329.1","pledges to the American flag the "],["331.919","Christian flag and the Bible and then we "],["334.979","would say a prayer and this really "],["336.9","seemed to orient everyone around the "],["339.06","true purpose of the camp and with Wanda "],["341.28","the true purpose of the club we're here "],["343.08","to affirm and grow in our faith in Jesus "],["346.32","and we are taking the Bible seriously "],["348.96","and even though I wasn't American at the "],["351.06","time I still respected the Pledge of "],["354","Allegiance if you're a camper of the "],["356.28","camper clubber at the Awana clubs you "],["358.44","participated in these exercises you "],["360.479","stood at attention you said the pledges "],["363.12","in unison and these acts disciplined and "],["366.06","they educated us now did everyone "],["368.639","believe what they were saying in their "],["370.68","hearts or were they just conforming to "],["372.96","the expectations of the ministry within "],["375.96","the assemblies within that community "],["379.02","well 40 years later I'd say some did "],["382.38","believe them but many were just going "],["385.74","through the motions and to be fair there "],["388.319","were times in my life that I too was "],["391.139","going through the motions because I've "],["392.759","been in church my entire life growing up "],["396.24","attending four Services a week plus "],["398.759","those CEF backyard Bible

six years old and I've grown "],["450.66","to cherish that "],["452.4","Above All Else "],["454.44","however I live in a day in an age when "],["457.68","I've seen the love of many grow cold

"],["342.979","cows why why would anybody be excited "],["345.86","about cows well "],["348.539","it has to do with an Old Testament laws "],["350.699","and customs in order to purify the

"],["382.199","you're into end times prophecies The "],["384.78","Book of Revelation Book of Daniel and "],["387.06","you're watching for these signs these "],["389.22","types of current events ooh we find "],["390.66","those very interesting I Think Jesus is "],["393","coming soon so every time I hear these "],["395.4","things "],["396.3","I make a note The Book of Daniel "],["398.52","prophesies about events in the last days "],["401.58","that will be taking place in the temple "],["404.1","itself but as of now there is "],["406.86","there's no Temple for these things to "],["408.539","happen

"],["418.74","planning and preparing to rebuild the "],["420.66","Temple hey that's pretty interesting "],["422.52","isn't it and if you really want Jesus to "],["425.16","come back soon you're going

"],["455.34","I hope I don't "],["456.66","get canceled like Kanye for saying this "],["459","but the Orthodox Jews plans to rebuild "],["462.9","the Temple and renew the Old Testament "],["465","religious practices is blatant "],["467.419","Disobedience to the revealed word of God "],["470.699","it's a false religion so yeah I'm "],["473.22","intrigued that they want to rebuild the "],["474.599","Temple because of the end time "],["475.68","prophecies that include the temple but "],["477.84","this would mean and that would mean that "],["479.819","our little interpretations are accurate "],["481.44","but this religion is not a god-honoring "],["484.259","religion because the New Covenant has "],["487.08","come and the old is no longer in effect "],["490.039","it's not doing the Jews any good matter "],["494.4","of fact it's distracting them from the "],["496.919","true means of honoring the Lord and I "],["499.08","think that is true of many of us "],["500.94","many of us are guilty of being "],["502.62","distracted from the true means of "],["506.16","honoring the Lord now verse 1 was a "],["508.139","little bit wordy "],["509.4","uh but if you pull out all the modifying "],["511.8","phrases this is what the verse literally "],["513.719","says the law can never make perfect see "],["517.38","that for the law since it is only a "],["519.599","shadow of good things to come and not "],["521.399","the form of very things can never by the "],["523.86","same sacrifices which are offered "],["525.42","continually year by year make perfect "],["527.459","those who draw near the law can never "],["530.22","make perfect "],["531.779","so let's look a little bit at some of "],["533.339","these modifying phrases "],["537.36","the law since it is a shadow that's the "],["540.839","second time the author has used the "],["542.88","shadow comparison we saw it back in "],["544.86","chapter 8 verse 5 and he said uh the law "],["548.94","served as a copy and a shadow of "],["550.74","heavenly things "],["552.06","so a copy and a shadow the priests are "],["555.24","not real mediators offering a real "],["557.64","sacrifice we said they're like actors "],["560.519","acting out the play telling the story of "],["563.82","what is really going to happen when the "],["565.98","Messiah does come and makes the real "],["568.14","sacrifice for us and then he goes up to "],["570.36","heaven he presents that to God the "],["572.459","father that's what the law that's what "],["574.5","all the customers that's what all the "],["575.76","rituals were they were just "],["577.58","foreshadowing of what was really going "],["580.08","to happen not the real act so those "],["582.36","sacrifices that were offered every year "],["584.519","all those goats and all those bulls and "],["587.16","all those Lambs that they killed and "],["588.72","shed the blood was never making anyone "],["591.42","perfect "],["592.44","if it could have then "],["595.56","they wouldn't have had to keep doing it "],["596.94","over and over again and that's the "],["598.32","author's point in verse two isn't it "],["599.7","otherwise "],["600.839","he says the law never makes them perfect "],["603","otherwise would they not have ceased to "],["605.339","be offered because the worshipers having "],["607.22","once been cleansed would no longer have "],["610.38","had consciousness of sin "],["612.959","so follow the author's logic if the "],["614.88","sacrifice made perfect then the "],["616.86","individual could have stopped doing them "],["618.18","his conscience would have been cleaned "],["619.86","condemnation resolved "],["622.62","but if those sacrifices could do that "],["625.5","that would have been good but that's not "],["627.899","what was happening right "],["630.06","in those sacrifices he says verse three "],["632.339","there's a reminder of sin year by year "],["635.76","the ritual laying on of hands of the "],["638.64","animal identifying my sin with this "],["640.98","animal's sin and then cutting its throat "],["642.959","and bleeding it all out reminded the "],["645.24","people oh your sins have

always being reminded every year "],["656.94","of all these sins that have piled up "],["658.2","from year to year "],["659.88","got to remember them "],["661.68","all year long and then keep making "],["663.839","sacrifices and that's what was happening "],["666.48","at the temple in Jerusalem and all the "],["668.7","Jews know this this is what they "],["669.959","practice the offerings the

"],["208.86","for death is the effect of our sins I "],["213.42","wish you weren't our soul I can't really "],["216.06","explain or completely understand why sin "],["219.3","must result in death but that is because "],["222.72","I do not completely understand the "],["225.36","Holiness of God and how reprehensible "],["228.599","sin is to him I cannot understand how "],["231.599","Lucifer being

"],["344.82","for where our covenant is "],["346.979","there must of necessity be the death of "],["349.44","the one who made it "],["351.419","so Covenant another word in the English "],["354","we

the individual what "],["507.66","dies right once they pass then the will "],["511.139","is open and the promises the covenants "],["513.36","are then enacted so this is what the "],["516.659","author is pointing out in order for the "],["519.24","first Covenant to be enacted death has "],["523.02","to be part of the formula but not just "],["525.24","any death not death by disease accident "],["527.94","or old age no there is a very specific "],["530.82","detail that is stressed in this passage "],["533.64","and what is that detail "],["535.62","Verse 18 therefore even the first

"],["586.92","he had this like back here as Grove of "],["590.279","Cedars and he would just throw the "],["592.32","carcasses up there to decompose after "],["594.899","they'd slaughtered cows so we would go "],["596.88","out looking in the woods and we'd find "],["598.74","all these skeletons and they'd be like "],["600.72","you know big skulls and and the ribs and "],["603.66","you take the

"],["112.56","the Bible there are 46 chapters devoted "],["115.92","to explaining the Tabernacle and the "],["118.92","worships that went on there and since "],["121.079","God devoted so much of his inspired word "],["123.36","to talk about it we have to conclude "],["125.579","it's kind of a big deal "],["127.799","so let's see if we can pay attention to "],["130.2","some of these details and figure out why "],["132.959","the religious facilities and the "],["134.94","Furnishings of the Tabernacle are so "],["137.16","important to God so guess what we're in "],["139.56","Hebrews chapter 9 this morning Hebrews "],["143.28","chapter 9 uh starting in verse number "],["145.5","one now even the first Covenant had "],["149.04","regulations of divine worship and the "],["151.86","Earthly sanctuary "],["153.599","for there was a tabernacle prepared the "],["155.879","outer one in which were the lampstand "],["158.22","the table the sacred bread this is "],["161.16","called the holy place behind the second "],["163.44","Veil there is a tabernacle which is "],["165.599","called the holy of holies having a "],["167.819","golden altar of incense and the Ark of "],["169.98","the

"],["202.14","not without taking blood which he "],["203.819","offered for himself and for the sins of "],["205.62","the people committed in ignorance "],["207.78","the holy spirit is signifying this that "],["210.3","the way into the holy place has not yet "],["212.94","been disclosed while the outer "],["215.22","Tabernacle is still standing which is a "],["218.159","symbol for the present time

"],["238.86","things to come he entered through the "],["241.019","greater more perfect Tabernacle not made "],["244.379","with hands that is to say not of this "],["246.54","creation and through the blood of and "],["248.7","not through the blood of goats and "],["250.56","calves but through his own blood he "],["253.86","entered the holy Place once for all "],["256.44","having obtained "],["258.479","Eternal Redemption "],["260.579","four if the blood of goats and Bulls and "],["264.479","the ashes of a halfird sprinkled those "],["266.639","who have been defiled Sanctified for the

for the Redemption of the "],["291.72","transgressions that were committed under "],["293.28","the first Covenant those who've been "],["295.38","called may receive the promise of the "],["298.68","Eternal inheritance "],["302.04","for almost 500 years the Tabernacle "],["305.699","served as a place for God to dwell among "],["308.94","his people in the Old Testament a place "],["311.28","where his people could come and commune "],["313.56","with him through Israel's history they "],["316.08","had this propensity towards idolatry so "],["319.139","the Tabernacle stood there as a visual "],["321.18","reminder to Israel that they served a "],["323.52","true and living God the structure and "],["325.68","the service that the temple showed to a "],["328.199","sinful people was how they could come to "],["330.78","God for worship and service how they "],["333.06","could offer a sacrifice for sin and how "],["335.639","they could receive instruction and "],["337.259","counsel from God "],["338.759","the Tabernacle was a graphic portrayal "],["341.759","of God's Redemptive program for Israel "],["344.34","every aspect of the temple from the "],["347.639","bronze Alder where the sacrifices were "],["349.68","offered to sin to the mediating High "],["352.259","priests who offered the sacrificial "],["353.759","Blood On The Mercy Seat pointed to God's "],["357.06","Redemptive plan for mankind "],["360.02","this fact is beautifully typified in the "],["363.419","ministry of Jesus Christ who left his "],["365.759","home in heaven and Tabernacles with his "],["370.38","people that's what that word means John "],["373.259","chapter 1 verse 14 the word became flesh "],["376.259","and "],["377.479","dwelts tabernacled among us and we "],["381.72","beheld the glory the only begotten of "],["383.34","the father full of grace and truth so "],["385.8","everything in "],["387.36","and everything done in the Tabernacle in "],["390.36","the Old Testament is a type of Jesus "],["393.3","Christ Ministry what is a type "],["397.919","when you type on your computer you input "],["400.8","symbols letters and they represent words "],["403.979","where words have meaning and they can "],["405.78","have multiple meanings at the same time "],["408.12","and so can pictures and so can objects "],["412.08","this is our of course our national flag "],["415.08","the Stars and Stripes symbolize "],["417.66","something I can bring Dr blazing up here "],["419.34","give us a whole lesson on that "],["421.08","everything on the flag has meaning and "],["423.12","the flag itself has various means "],["425.22","various things to various people all "],["427.44","around us we see lots of symbols that "],["430.259","communicate elaborate ideas and we too "],["433.86","as Christians we have developed symbols "],["436.56","that when we see these things we know "],["438.96","there's an elaborate theological "],["440.46","teaching behind all of them "],["443.16","so that's what we're looking at here "],["446.24","everything in this temple in this "],["449.4","Tabernacle everything done in the "],["451.38","Tabernacle is all a type of Jesus Christ "],["455.28","Ministry so typology is a special kind "],["459.66","of symbolism when we say that someone in "],["463.08","the Old Testament is a type of Christ "],["464.699","we're saying that that person behaves in "],["467.28","a way that corresponds to Jesus "],["469.5","character or actions in the New "],["471.599","Testament so what's an example of that "],["473.58","okay well Moses when he leads the "],["476.639","children of Israel out of slavery in "],["479.22","Egypt and leading them to the promised "],["481.8","land he's a "],["484.02","type of Jesus who leads us out of the "],["487.62","slavery of sin and towards the Glorious "],["491.52","Eternal promise prompt blessings right "],["493.919","the uh when we say something is a type "],["497.4","of Christ we're saying that an object or "],["500.699","an event so it could be a person but it "],["502.68","could also be an object or event in the "],["504.539","Old Testament is viewed as representing "],["507.06","some quality of Christ for example the "],["510.36","lamb that was killed in Egypt and the "],["514.74","blood was put on the doorpost of the "],["517.68","homes so when the death angel came in "],["520.14","for the final plague would pass over and "],["522.539","not kill everybody we say that that is a "],["525.24","type of Jesus when he was sacrificed in "],["528.959","his blood cleanses us from our sins so "],["531.72","that we too death will pass over us and "],["534.24","we can have "],["535.279","everlasting life "],["537.54","according to Hebrews chapter 9. the "],["541.68","entire "],["542.72","sacrificial system of the Old Testament "],["546","of the Tabernacle is all a type "],["549.779","so here's an artist's rendition of what "],["552.36","is being described the Tabernacle so "],["555.12","first we have what is the uh wall it's "],["558.6","it's like tents you know canvas wall and "],["562.26","so then there's it's separating it from "],["564.3","the whole big Camp of Israel and then "],["567.06","there's an outer Court where out things "],["568.8","were done outside within the outer wall "],["571.2","but still outside and then there is the "],["574.92","tent structure there that we also called "],["576.899","The Tabernacle specifically and then "],["579.18","that has two specific rooms in it so the "],["584.16","outer court is sectioned off outer area "],["586.74","has two pieces of furniture do you know "],["588.36","what they are there's the bronze Altar "],["591.42","and then there is the bronze lava and "],["594.839","that's a we use that French lab is to "],["597.24","wash so the Laver is a big base in the "],["600.3","water that they washed in and inside the "],["603.48","Tabernacle tent itself it's divided into "],["605.94","two rooms one room is called the holy "],["608.7","place which was 15 feet by 30 feet and "],["612.12","then 15 feet high and then not to be "],["615.42","confused there's the holy place and then "],["617.04","there's the holy of holies so there's "],["619.38","the holy Place 15 by 30 and then the "],["621.839","holy of holies which was smaller was 15 "],["624.06","by 15 it was a square and then within "],["627.779","that tent there was different "],["630.3","pieces of furniture as well so in the "],["632.76","Holy place the bigger one there's the "],["635.279","table of show bread uh stood at the "],["638.1","right side of the Holy Place 12 loaves "],["640.38","of bread on the table they were a meal "],["642.6","offering representing 12. that's a we "],["645.42","recognize that symbolic number 12 pieces "],["648.6","of show bread symbolizing 12 tribes of "],["652.8","Israel the showbread also is a type of "],["656.459","Christ who is our "],["659.339","Jesus said I am the the bread of life "],["662.94","so that's the type of Christ and when we "],["665.7","do our Lord's Supper he says this bread "],["668.339","is my body broken for you "],["672.12","the also in the uh holy place is the "],["675.959","seven Branch golden Candlestick "],["678.68","providing the light to the Tabernacle "],["682.459","Jesus is the "],["684.899","is it over here it's up here haha there "],["687.24","it is the light of the world boy I'm "],["688.86","glad we have our banners today they "],["690.12","really are helpful aren't they I am the "],["692.24","light of the world "],["695.279","also the third piece of furniture in the "],["697.98","Holy place is the altar of incense stood "],["700.5","in the Holy place just in front of the "],["702.48","veiled holy of holies calls from the "],["705.18","Brazen altar were carried in and placed "],["708.959","on the altar of incense over which "],["710.88","incense was poured daily and the smoke "],["713.1","from the incense curled upward and "],["715.5","represents according to scripture the "],["717.48","prayers of God's people we see these "],["720.24","prayers collected in the Book of "],["721.92","Revelation before great calamities are "],["724.38","poured out on the earth go read up on "],["726.18","that at another time also between the "],["728.94","holy place and the holy holies what was "],["731.82","there "],["733.2","the Veil separating the two standing "],["737.579","stands for the separation between a holy "],["740.1","God and sinful people and then in the "],["743.7","holy of holies "],["745.079","one piece of furniture "],["746.94","the Ark of the covenants and on top of "],["750.06","the Ark of the Covenant is the "],["752.16","Mercy Seat stands on top as a covering "],["755.519","on the top of the Ark of The covenant's "],["757.86","Mercy Seat are two angels to cherub "],["761.22","who are facing each other but looking "],["763.019","down at the mercy seat with their wings "],["764.639","stretched out and it was on the mercy "],["766.92","seats that the high priest sprinkled the "],["768.899","blood on the day of atonement which "],["770.519","enabled God to cover the sins of the "],["774","high priest and the people "],["775.62","so let's zoom in on these items and see "],["778.68","how they were used let's move back "],["780.24","outside to the outer court and I'm going "],["781.98","to give you some pictures I drew these "],["784.079","no I did not "],["786.06","this is the bronze altar the largest "],["788.459","piece of furniture used in worship "],["789.959","always open to all guilty Israelites for "],["793.8","them to atone for their sin the Brazen "],["796.139","altar was where you provided the "],["798.48","sacrifice so somberly the Israelites "],["801.6","brought a prescribed animal offering "],["803.94","without spotter blemish to the priest "],["805.98","they stood at that odor tent wall and "],["809.339","with the Tabernacle gate to offer them "],["811.279","the offerer would lay their hands on the "],["814.98","head of the animal "],["816.42","symbolic of their identification with "],["819.72","the animals substitutionary death on "],["823.56","their behalf they're identifying with "],["825.54","their hands on the animal and they're "],["827.399","transferring symbolically their sins "],["829.56","onto this animal and the animal's life "],["831.899","is being transferred back to this person "],["834.779","and then the offer slit the animal's "],["837.839","throat and the pie priest the priest "],["840.18","would catch the blood in a in a basin "],["842.76","and then the priest would take the blood "],["844.86","to the bronze Altar and put the blood on "],["848.1","the Altar and on the fire and then dump "],["850.26","the rest of the blood in here in a basin "],["852.54","that was at the bottom "],["854.459","and then the priest would cut the "],["856.56","sacrifice sacrifice up into pieces they "],["859.62","had a whole elaborate washing of the

"],["1252.32","Israel first went into the Wilderness "],["1253.64","and they're in a "],["1257","Wilderness right so what is there to eat "],["1260.059","nothing in whatever food they had that "],["1262.76","they got in there as roughly about they "],["1265.16","a Scholars estimate like maybe two "],["1266.6","million people in this entire nation "],["1269","that went out there and uh so

"],["1286.94","their tents and all on the ground is "],["1291.5","what is it "],["1292.94","I know but what's manna "],["1295.28","what is it that's literally what it "],["1296.659","means right

"],["1306.74","could store it for how long "],["1309.679","just one day they could get enough for "],["1311.659","that one day and what happens if they "],["1313.46","try to keep it and have leftovers the "],["1315.08","next day "],["1315.919","it all goes to worms and rocks right so "],["1318.02","it's gross so it's not going to last "],["1319.52","it's your daily bread and Jesus taught "],["1322.58","us to pray give us this day our daily "],["1324.679","bread so you have to come to God new "],["1326.72","every day every morning and receive His "],["1329.419","blessings and receive his word that's an "],["1331.82","important principle that we learn there "],["1333.14","so they have the the pot of Amana and "],["1336.26","that was this to remind the people of "],["1337.88","God's

Aaron's Rod Aaron's "],["1351.02","Rod that budded what was going on with "],["1353.419","that Rod anybody remember that story so "],["1355.94","we had these uh Rebels the the guys what "],["1359.6","was their names oh I wrote it down now I "],["1361.039","gotta walk over here it's going to tell "],["1362.179","my story and I walked away Cora Dawson "],["1364.94","and Arabic Abraham and he they gathered "],["1369.22","250 Rebels from all the 12 tribes and "],["1373.58","they're all upset at Moses and Aaron and "],["1376.64","they're like oh you guys to be in charge "],["1377.96","of us and who made you well we know who "],["1380.659","made them the leaders right but they're "],["1382.4","they're rebelling against Moses and "],["1384.44","Aaron and ultimately they're rebelling "],["1385.64","against who God right but they have "],["1388.039","rallied enough people they got a real "],["1389.6","Revolt going on there so God tells Moses "],["1392.78","here's how we're going to settle this "],["1393.86","I'll show the people I'll give you a "],["1395.6","sign every "],["1397.46","tribe is going to give one rod what's a "],["1401.299","rod "],["1402.74","just a wooden stick right it's just "],["1404.48","something that everybody had walking "],["1405.5","sticks back then so there's going to be "],["1407.299","one rod from every tribe and you'll "],["1409.7","write the name of the tribe on it so "],["1411.32","we're going to write Ephraim on this one "],["1412.76","and we'll write Judo on this one and "],["1414.26","Benjamin on this one and then Aaron's "],["1416.72","Rod is from the tribe of "],["1419.539","Levi so Aaron's rod says Levi take all "],["1422.9","the rods and we're going to put them in "],["1424.76","the Tabernacle "],["1426.38","at night and "],["1429.679","whatever and the whatever Rod "],["1432.28","blossoms is the one that God has said "],["1435.26","that is the high priest from that tribe "],["1438.26","so they put all these dead sticks in the "],["1441.559","Tabernacle and then guess who's Rod "],["1443.84","blossomed "],["1445.58","and not only did it Blossom what did it "],["1447.5","grow "],["1448.58","full "],["1449.84","adult almonds all in one night blossomed "],["1453.02","and grew almonds out of a dead stick and "],["1455.48","that was a miracle and that was God's "],["1457.4","way of saying that Aaron has the right "],["1460.28","to be the high priest and then lastly "],["1462.26","what's in that Ark "],["1464.179","two tablets of the "],["1466.159","Ten

that'll be "],["1474.26","another for another time but then it "],["1475.88","would they were re re-given and they "],["1478.4","were in the Ark of the Covenant and then "],["1481.159","the uh the Cherub were on top so that's "],["1485.24","a basic rundown of the Tabernacle and "],["1488.539","kind of the processes of what went on in "],["1490.94","there "],["1492.14","so it says going back to Hebrews chapter "],["1494.539","nine and it said we read the different "],["1497.48","things that were in there as he listed "],["1499.159","them in verse four uh the covenants uh "],["1503.539","the Ark of the Covenant and then the "],["1505.52","gold on that and then within its the "],["1508.64","Mana Aaron's Rod the Covenant above the "],["1511.88","chair verse five of Glory over shouting "],["1514.4","The Mercy Seat but of these things we "],["1516.919","cannot now speak in detail he says "],["1519.62","we can't speak in detail why not well "],["1521.48","because I already told you there's 46 "],["1523.28","chapters and the author in this letter "],["1525.679","does not have time to go through all 46 "],["1528.14","chapters and give all the meaning and "],["1530.779","nor would he had needed to because his "],["1533.179","audience the Jews were very familiar "],["1535.52","with all these activities everything "],["1537.14","that happened "],["1538.34","that was part of their culture but the "],["1540.679","author wants to make a point "],["1542.84","so here's the point verse 9 verse 6. now "],["1546.02","when these things have been so prepared "],["1549.38","the priests are continually entering the "],["1551.72","outer Tabernacle performing The Divine "],["1553.46","worship but into the seconds only the "],["1556.46","high priest enters once a year not "],["1558.14","without taking blood which he offers for "],["1560.24","himself and for the sins of the people "],["1562.159","that committed an ignorance the Holy "],["1564.679","Spirit signifies this that the way into "],["1567.02","the holy place has not yet been "],["1569.419","disclosed while the outer Tabernacle is "],["1572.9","still standing which is a symbol for the "],["1575.9","present time "],["1580.299","so all of the various priests "],["1583.64","tended to the light in the bread and the "],["1585.98","offering the incense on the Altar and "],["1587.659","The Cutting of the animals up and "],["1589.159","barbecue and all that but they did this "],["1592.46","when did they do this "],["1595.52","every day every day non-stop all day "],["1599.059","long as Israelites because there's 200 "],["1601.22","200 million or of them right and they "],["1603.26","come in there two million of them and "],["1605","they are offering sacrifices all the "],["1607.64","time "],["1608.659","but according to the law even the priest "],["1612.32","can't go into the holy holies only the "],["1614.6","high priest and only once a year this is "],["1616.76","the thing he's pointing out here verse "],["1618.799","7. "],["1619.82","now contrast that to what we've already "],["1622.88","learned about Jesus ministry as the high "],["1624.919","priest look at chapter 7 verse 26 as a "],["1628.46","review chapter 7 verse 26 and 27. "],["1633.32","the author says "],["1635.539","for is fitting for us to have such a "],["1638.6","high priest holy innocent undefiled "],["1642.14","separate from Sinners exalted above the "],["1645.2","heavens who does not need daily like "],["1649.52","those High priests to offer up the "],["1651.32","sacrifices first for his own sins and "],["1653","then for the sins of the people because "],["1654.38","he did once for all when he offered "],["1657.559","himself look at chapter 8 verses one and "],["1660.86","two now the main point in what is being "],["1663.559","said is this we have such a high priest "],["1666.14","who's taken his seat at the right hand "],["1668.6","of the Throne of the Majesty in the "],["1670.1","heavens a minister in the sanctuary and "],["1672.38","in the true Tabernacle which the Lord "],["1674.779","pitched not man "],["1677.62","Jesus doesn't have to make sacrifices "],["1680.779","repeatedly he did it once for All Time "],["1684.32","and Eternity and Jesus stays in the "],["1687.62","presence of God and he sits and the "],["1690.14","throne where the Tabernacle where "],["1693.44","in heaven "],["1694.82","always

and the kitchen "],["201.239","was really just a corner with some "],["204.06","cabinets on the wall in the living room "],["206.04","kitchen was just all one little room "],["208.14","within weeks of getting married we found "],["210.84","out that we were expecting actually "],["213.3","Eliana is pregnant not me but she was "],["215.04","having a baby and okay so this one "],["217.319","bedroom

that had a shower and a "],["231.18","nice balcony view all new carpets and "],["234.9","all new paint so no smells and it costs "],["238.14","less money "],["240.12","oh that sounds "],["242.34","better right after a year of being there "],["245.459","our landlord said the red is going to go "],["247.2","up but the church that we were serving "],["249.06","it they had a house that became "],["251.099","available and that house had three "],["253.14","bedrooms two baths lots of storage in "],["256.019","the basement it was right next to the "],["258.359","church so we didn't have to drive and "],["260.88","the rent was going to be "],["262.8","less oh that sounds better a year after "],["267.3","living there the deacons were so kind "],["269.1","and they said hey we want to get you to "],["270.84","pay the oil Bill uh at that place and "],["273.54","the oil first of all this place had "],["275.28","drafty windows and a big crack in the "],["277.62","basement and in Canada that was "],["279.54","impossible place to heat and the oil was "],["281.96","astronomical really expensive and so we "],["285.66","were tired of granting at that point "],["286.979","anyways and we were praying that we "],["288.54","could find a place that we could buy so "],["291","we found this interesting old home in "],["294.18","downtown it had three levels and each "],["296.82","level was set up to be its own "],["298.56","one-bedroom apartment one bedroom rental "],["301.16","so uh we had three baths in that house "],["304.74","and on the top level we took that for "],["307.5","our bedrooms we put the kids in the "],["308.94","bedroom and then Eliana and I took the "],["310.86","living room for our bedroom and then the "],["313.5","middle level we had the living room and "],["315.479","we had the kitchen we used as a family "],["317.04","and then there was a spare bedroom that "],["319.08","was like the playroom and the guest room "],["321.6","and then the basement "],["323.16","I rented it out to my cousin and for a "],["326.28","couple hundred bucks a month "],["327.6","and we bought that house for forty nine "],["331.139","thousand dollars "],["333.12","can you imagine "],["335.52","so with the rental income we were now "],["338.4","owning had more space and we were paying "],["342.419","less oh that sounds better for us better "],["348.78","meant more usable space for less money "],["353.82","doesn't that sound better "],["355.5","does to me I'm curious why lots of "],["358.02","people think paying more and getting "],["359.16","less is better well you know what do I "],["361.38","know I'm not a politician things are "],["363.18","very complicated in DC they have "],["364.86","different meanings for words like better "],["368.639","today we're going to learn about a "],["371.1","better Covenant that Jesus is offering "],["374.28","so naturally we want to know the details "],["376.68","of what exactly is

"],["536.82","that God made with the nation of Israel "],["539.04","on Mount Sinai we see all the details of "],["542.1","it in the book of Exodus chapters 19 to "],["544.32","24 the formula of the

right "],["773.459","and that costs some money and I already "],["775.38","put the money into that one so what are "],["777.48","the advantages of going out and buying "],["779.16","something new and

works "],["791.279","all the automatic features are working "],["793.5","hey look the AC is blowing cold remember "],["796.26","that "],["797.82","it's newer it has less miles okay but "],["801.779","you know we're going to spend a lot of "],["802.92","money so what else do we want you know "],["804.839","let's shop around well leather interior "],["807.24","would be nice and a

"],["724.38","some people think that we visualized God "],["728.399","on a throne because this is the history "],["732.12","of humanity monarchs sit on Throne so "],["734.76","naturally we just we we

"],["873.779","here "],["874.86","hmm why would he sit on stuff up there "],["878.279","why would it say back in Genesis chapter "],["880.62","1 26 and God said let us make man in "],["885.48","our

"],["979.86","statements that the author wrote it "],["982.68","probably we should take it that way so "],["986.339","if you believe that Jesus literally died "],["989.519","on a cross and rose again that's going "],["992.519","to be a literal interpretation why would "],["995.279","you come to a passage like this and say "],["997.44","I'm not going to take that literally "],["998.88","because the

that we're able to understand "],["1020.019","language and we're able to understand "],["1022.04","what God's word is saying to us so "],["1025.16","God said he had a throne I'm going to

"],["1036.26","which is also that's a very different "],["1039.02","action than the high priest on Earth has "],["1042.079","right there's no "],["1044.839","seats or chairs in the temple that the "],["1047.72","high priest used to sit down on that's "],["1049.82","because the Old Testament high priest "],["1051.799","their work was never done but Jesus on "],["1055.1","the other hand he as we

"],["1066.02","then for the sins of the people "],["1067.76","because this he did once for all when he "],["1072.559","offered up himself Jesus sacrifice was "],["1077.179","once for all and once he

that there's other people "],["1095.96","that wanted to sit at the throne and be "],["1097.4","on the throne right remember from Isaiah "],["1099.02","chapter 14 Lucifer said in his heart I "],["1102.38","will Ascend to the heavens above the "],["1104","stars of God I will set my Throne on hot "],["1107","I will sit on the Mount of the Assembly "],["1109.1","of the far sides of the north

"],["1423.26","the order of "],["1425.14","Melchizedek and that was a couple weeks "],["1427.88","ago "],["1429.2","but then notice author says about the "],["1431.539","gifts according to the law

in the "],["1462.14","sanctuary the what kind of Tabernacle "],["1465.46","true Tabernacle in heaven which the Lord "],["1469.52","pitched he talked about the Tabernacle "],["1471.98","not the temple the Tabernacle we "],["1474.26","remember from Exodus was a tent it was "],["1476.96","the first meeting place erected by Moses "],["1479.96","while the children of Israel were in the

"],["1527.299","don't believe in this anthropomorphism "],["1529.52","concept "],["1531.02","because the word of God literally says "],["1533.539","the law is a copy is a shadow of

J.R.R Tolkien books "],["176.58","so I'll just admit that this is a whole "],["179.22","new world to me "],["181.5","three hours later when the movie was "],["183.54","done "],["184.92","I was quite annoyed because yes the "],["187.92","movie had ended but the story had not "],["190.86","I'd watched three hours of weird "],["193.019","characters running around getting "],["194.7","nowheres just like the the bad guy the "],["197.099","good guys were losing the bad guys were "],["199.08","winning I was lost and who was who and "],["201.36","there was no conclusion and now I gotta "],["203.159","wait a whole year to see how this all "],["205.86","plays out "],["207.84","when the sequel came out I watched two "],["210.18","towers my opinion about the movie "],["211.8","changed

oh that was new in the "],["228.18","end the heroes were winning the story "],["229.98","wasn't over there was another whole "],["231.36","movie yet to come but now I was really "],["234.48","into it and I wanted to see that final "],["236.28","movie "],["237.42","I even went back and re-watched The "],["239.099","Fellowship of the Rings and it made a "],["240.959","lot more sense now second timer out I "],["243.84","have to say I think the whole thing was "],["245.4","a very awesome Series so this year "],["248.4","Amazon Prime video released a new series "],["251.159","called rings of power it's more stories "],["253.98","coming from the world of J.R.R Tolkien "],["257.16","we watch season one and I really felt "],["259.68","like I was understanding what was going "],["261.54","on in this make-believe world because I "],["263.699","remember the Lord of the Rings and then "],["265.139","of course I watched all the Hobbit "],["266.52","series it was all very familiar to me "],["268.259","but if I hadn't seen any of those movies "],["270.3","I once again with this rings of power "],["272.4","thing that Amazon put out I would have "],["274.38","been lost "],["275.4","because it's an entire world with all "],["278.46","these races of people and story lines "],["280.68","that just cover hundreds and hundreds "],["282.78","and hundreds of years it's it's very "],["284.759","complex but that is after all the "],["286.919","Brilliance of Tolkien like you know "],["289.979","another good example would be Star Wars "],["291.84","it's very similar an

they're long and elaborate and "],["313.56","actually that's part of the fun right if "],["315.18","you who likes those kind of movies right "],["316.44","if you like those kind of movies lots of "],["317.94","you right you like the complexities of "],["320.52","the world and the timelines that they're "],["322.38","covering and how the action in one "],["324.18","generation impacts the story in the "],["325.8","future Generations now in the real world "],["328.88","we actually have the exact same thing "],["331.86","going on but we just don't think that "],["333.479","much about it we

there would "],["356.34","have to be some historical record "],["357.84","telling you what's happened and there "],["360.18","would have to be some foretelling of "],["362.52","what's going to happen

"],["432.96","us both the historical record telling "],["435.18","you what happened and it also foretells "],["438","what's going to happen "],["440.34","so a lot like you know as an analogy "],["443.039","Lord of the Rings or Star Wars it's very "],["445.259","complex but unlike them "],["447.599","does not fiction "],["448.979","this is what is going on what is will be "],["453.12","going on and what has happened what has "],["456.06","happened what is going on and what will "],["457.8","be going on and if you take the time to "],["460.199","learn it you will

"],["1365.419","verse 23 24. "],["1367.58","the former priest on the one hand "],["1370.64","existed in Greater number because they "],["1373.46","were prevented by Death from continuing "],["1375.799","but Jesus on the other

"],["1398","because they die too "],["1399.82","they died also so every few years they "],["1404.24","have to oh a priest died we got anoint a "],["1407.059","new priests and gotta find another actor "],["1409.039","to play the pirate mediator but with "],["1410.9","Jesus on the other hand the author says "],["1413.24","he never stops being the mediator "],["1415.1","because since he rose again

"],["1460.58","wasn't even they were dying at this "],["1462.679","point the Roman Empire and their puppet "],["1465.08","King Herod would just pick and choose "],["1467.78","high priest for the

"],["1577.88","said is this "],["1579.62","we have a high priest who's taken a seat "],["1581.96","at the right hand of the Throne of God "],["1583.4","and Majesty in the heavens there's Jesus "],["1586.94","where is he "],["1588.74","the right hand of God "],["1591.2","always and what's he doing "],["1594.559","making intercession the Devil comes he "],["1597.02","deserves death and Jesus

priesthood "],["1609.919","is is better one more "],["1612.08","verse 26 it was fitting for us to have "],["1614.48","such a high priest holy innocent "],["1617.12","undefiled separated from Sinners exalted "],["1619.46","above the heavens who does not need "],["1621.88","daily like those High priests to offer "],["1624.5","sacrifices first for his own sins "],["1627.08","and then for the sins of the people "],["1629.36","because this he did once for all when he "],["1633.26","offered up himself "],["1636.02","so look at all the descriptions "],["1639.919","in verse 26 that equal the same

"],["1662.12","deity of Jesus the godhood of Jesus "],["1664.52","that's not the point the author's making "],["1666.26","the point he's stressing is verse 27 he "],["1669.2","doesn't need daily like

"],["25.019","last study and I thought well usually I "],["28.859","like to go from New Testament and go "],["30.96","into the Old Testament and study a book "],["32.46","there but I thought well Hebrews would "],["34.559","be great because then we'll be able to "],["35.82","do a lot of Old Testament while we're "],["38.1","doing the New Testament the same time so "],["39.78","man this really is the case today as "],["42.66","we're going to be in Hebrews chapter 7 "],["46.28","some lots of lots of content okay so "],["51.66","last week we sought to Grass the meaning "],["54.18","of the oath that God swore to Abraham "],["57.539","back in the Book of Genesis we call that "],["60.42","the abrahamic Covenant the three parts "],["63.48","of that is the "],["65.4","land and the seed and the blessing right "],["69.479","you know you uh God says you will have "],["71.88","so many descendants Abraham you won't be "],["74.939","able to count them all you will have "],["76.74","this piece of land right here this piece "],["79.08","of real estate as a inheritance for them "],["81.78","forever and through your line through "],["84.6","your seed all the nations of the world "],["86.88","will be blessed so the audience here in "],["90.78","Hebrews they know all about this "],["93.06","Covenant God made with Abraham because "],["94.92","it's a huge part of the Jewish Heritage "],["97.14","we are God's chosen people that's why he "],["100.14","brought us out of slavery in Egypt and "],["102.479","brought us to this promised land and why "],["104.7","he has sustained us uh for 1900 years of "],["108.96","conquest and persecution yet they were "],["111.54","still in that land and when there was 70 "],["114.479","years of Exile where they were all "],["115.86","completely taken to Babylon God brought "],["118.5","them back again to that land and gave "],["120.06","them the means to rebuild their Temple "],["122.159","and rebuild the city of Jerusalem so "],["124.259","their understanding gaining of who they "],["126.54","are as a people their identity is very "],["129.72","much tied in with this oath that we were "],["131.22","studying last week and while yes uh here "],["134.099","in Hebrews this is now like "],["137.239","65 A.D when this was written "],["140.34","they are uh still in the lands but they "],["144.9","are an occupied people the Romans are or "],["147.36","have dominion over them uh in their mind "],["149.94","their Messiah hasn't showed up yet so "],["152.16","they think their king of righteousness "],["154.14","their Prince of Peace he's nowhere to be "],["155.64","seen "],["156.42","so they they did know and believe in the "],["159.3","oath but they still had not seen all of "],["161.94","it come to reality land seed and "],["164.879","blessing Abraham had Faith to believe in "],["168.3","these promises of God that sounds great "],["170.099","but how exactly are they going to play "],["172.2","out the author says in his discussion "],["174.959","about the faith of Abraham last week we "],["177.54","talked about how we can be like him and "],["179.76","take hold of that hope that is set "],["182.4","before us so just in in review chapter 6 "],["185.54","uh we finished up verse 19 this hope we "],["188.58","have as an anchor for the soul I hope "],["191.94","both sure and steadfast and one which "],["194.519","enters within the veil where Jesus has "],["197.22","entered as a forerunner for us having "],["200.04","become a high priest forever according "],["203.4","to the order of Melchizedek so Jesus is "],["206.879","the hope he is the Messiah he enters "],["209.28","within the veil and we talked about that "],["211.26","that last week and we know that that is "],["213.239","in the Old Testament system that was the "],["215.519","job of the high priest increase to bring "],["217.98","the sacrifices into the holy of holies "],["219.959","in through the veil and to present those "],["222.959","to God and and so it says that Jesus is "],["225.599","going to do that yes exactly Jesus is "],["228.42","the high priest Jesus enters the bail "],["231.06","comes before God he says as a "],["234.44","Forerunner for us now wait a second a "],["237.959","forerunner a forerunner is someone who "],["240.42","comes in advance to a place where the "],["243.959","rest will follow sort of like a a scout "],["247.08","maybe an eagle scout right or an "],["248.94","ambassador Jesus is a forerunner what "],["252.299","meaning that we all will eventually go "],["256.019","within the veil too we are all going in "],["258.479","the presence of God that's not possible "],["260.639","in the law of Moses only the high priest "],["263.46","could go within the veil nobody else got "],["266.1","in yes that is correct but let's cheat "],["269.639","and look at chapter 7 verse 19. look at "],["272.759","this verse "],["275.88","the author says for the law made nothing "],["278.46","perfect and on the other hand there is a "],["282.24","bringing in of a better hope through "],["284.699","which we draw near to God "],["289.74","oh so Jesus is the Hope matter of fact "],["292.979","he's a better hope the hope of providing "],["295.68","for us the opportunity to what "],["298.08","draw near to God well that was never the "],["301.56","conditions or the promises made in the "],["303.66","priesthood of Aaron that's right "],["306.199","Jesus we learned in Hebrews chapter 3 "],["309.3","verse 1 is a high priest of our calling "],["312.54","but it's not our calling is is different "],["315.479","than the Old Testament calling of the "],["318.479","law of Moses not the Aaron priesthood "],["321.18","Jesus is a high priest of the order of "],["324.78","who "],["326.78","melchizedek's priesthood and we learned "],["329.94","about this in chapter 5 verse number "],["332.28","five so Christ did not glorify himself "],["335.22","as to become a high priest but he also "],["337.62","said to him you are my son today I've "],["339.479","begotten to you just as he said in "],["341.4","another passage you are a priest forever "],["343.68","according to the order of Melchizedek "],["345.96","and then verse number nine having made "],["348.36","having been made perfect he became to "],["350.94","all those who obey him the source of "],["353.28","Eternal salvation being designated by "],["355.38","God as a high priest according to the "],["357.6","order of Melchizedek and Pastor Rob "],["360.539","didn't do anything on that back in "],["363.18","chapter five so you don't know what that "],["364.68","means you don't know what is that what "],["367.8","is the priesthood of Melchizedek and how "],["371.16","is it different from Aaron's that's what "],["373.62","we're going to get into today isn't that "],["374.82","exciting we're going to get right into "],["376.139","that so lots of think about here but "],["378.78","before we go into the deep end let's "],["381.539","make sure we know what we're going to "],["383.58","try to grab a hold of like let's do just "],["386.4","lay that out at the beginning have you "],["387.72","ever played that game "],["388.94","at the swimming pool where somebody "],["391.319","throws change into the deep end and then "],["393.96","you're supposed to dive in and go find "],["396","it at the bottom anybody ever ever do "],["398.46","that right so you're supposed to turn "],["399.9","turn your back and you're not supposed "],["401.22","to watch and they throw the change in "],["403.259","the water and then you're supposed to "],["405.12","swim down there and swim around and find "],["407.4","it and you know you can kind of run out "],["409.319","of air down there and drown it's a great "],["411.24","game you know lots of fun and uh but you "],["414","may not get it but you know one of one "],["415.919","of uh Pastor Rob's hacks because he's "],["418.259","always a cheater so they say uh if if "],["420.9","you're uh playing that game and they "],["422.94","throw the change and you turn around "],["424.139","look real quick and you can see a ripple "],["426.3","in the water oh Amy's done that right "],["428.639","Amy Amy knows hey he's a cheater like me "],["430.259","so you see the Ripple and you're like "],["431.759","okay I kind of know where the change is "],["434.699","so that's gonna really I don't have to "],["437.52","swim the whole bottom I can just kind of "],["439.199","get to that place right there and that's "],["441.24","going to help so you know what you're "],["442.919","trying to grab you're not trying to grab "],["444.66","bugs or dead bugs or leaves you're "],["447.36","trying to find change and you kind of "],["448.62","know where you need to go so that really "],["450.66","helps you be successful in getting down "],["453.24","there and getting it so it helps so let "],["455.94","me show you what we're trying to grab a "],["458.639","hold of before we dive in because I "],["462.06","don't want you to run out of air this "],["463.56","morning at the bottom of the "],["464.699","metaphorical Hebrews 7 pool I don't want "],["467.699","to waste too much time grabbing a hold "],["469.139","of the wrong stuff okay so look at "],["472.56","chapter 7 verse 7. "],["475.259","without any dispute the Lesser is "],["478.86","blessed by the greater okay so that's "],["481.979","the point the author is going to make "],["484.02","something in someone is lesser and "],["487.5","someone is greater "],["489.96","okay see the ripples that's that's where "],["492.24","the change went down that's what we're "],["493.979","going after the Lesser is better than "],["496.38","the greater okay we're gonna jump in "],["497.699","ready one two "],["500.819","three okay chapter seven verse number "],["503.34","one four this Melchizedek talking about "],["506.22","Melchizedek king of Salem Priests of the "],["509.22","most high God who met Abraham as he was "],["511.62","returning from the slaughter of the "],["512.76","Kings and blessed him we'll we'll do "],["514.26","that story "],["515.82","to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth "],["520.5","part of all the spoils "],["522.839","was first of all by the translation of "],["525.72","his name "],["526.56","king of righteousness Melchizedek "],["528.12","literally means in Hebrew king of "],["530.279","righteousness and then also king of "],["533.94","Salem which is king of Priests of Peace "],["537.3","Salem is the Hebrew word for peace "],["539.399","without father without mother without "],["541.22","genealogy having neither beginning of "],["544.019","days nor end of life but made like the "],["547.14","Son of God he remains a priest "],["549.72","perpetually observe how great this man "],["552.54","was to Abraham the patriarch he gave a "],["555.54","tenth of the choices spoils "],["559.1","okay cool observe how great this man is "],["563.04","now "],["564.24","verse 4 is where the author is going the "],["566.94","greatness of Melchizedek but as we swim "],["569.76","down there through verses one through "],["572.22","three I think these verses strongly "],["575.279","suggest that Melchizedek in Genesis "],["578.279","chapter 14 and Jesus in the New "],["582.12","Testament are quite possibly "],["584.64","one in the same "],["586.92","what how how is that possible well it is "],["591.6","absolutely theologically possible "],["593.459","because we know Jesus is the Alpha and "],["596.399","the "],["597.54","Omega he's the beginning and the end was "],["601.8","he in Genesis "],["603.899","well he had to be because John writes in "],["606.3","John's gospel in the beginning was the "],["609","the word the word was with God and the "],["612","word "],["613.08","was God the same was in the beginning "],["614.82","with God all things were made by him "],["616.56","without him was not anything made that "],["618.3","was made and then who was he talking "],["620.339","about well the word became "],["623.339","flesh and dwelt among us and we behold "],["625.5","his glory the glory the only begotten of "],["627.06","the father full of grace and truth so "],["628.74","that is "],["629.76","the Sunday School answer Jesus okay "],["632.399","that's who that is we believe in a "],["634.86","Triune God a three in one there's the "],["639.66","Father the Son and the Holy Spirit so "],["644.459","when we hear God talking he's not he's "],["646.92","not a schizophrenic in Genesis chapter "],["648.72","one where God said let us make man in "],["651.18","our image so who are you talking to God "],["652.74","well that's the Trinity they're "],["654.54","dialoguing Father Son and Holy Spirit "],["656.579","let's make man in our image so according "],["659.279","to scripture Jesus always existed "],["663.3","but in the Old Testament he wasn't "],["664.86","called his name wasn't called Jesus most "],["667.8","the time when we read the Old Testament "],["669.72","authors and they say and the Lord said "],["671.82","we always think that's who "],["674.7","God the father right the Lord spoke to "],["676.92","Noah the Lord spoke to Adam the Lord God "],["679.14","spoke to Moses but "],["681.66","there are these instances "],["684.24","when someone physically shows up in the "],["688.2","stories and they're not humans but "],["691.2","they're not called angels "],["694.68","remember any of these like Shadrach "],["697.2","Meshach and Abednego when they were "],["698.399","thrown in the fiery furnace remember "],["699.6","they were the guys in captivity in "],["701.64","Babylon and Nebuchadnezzar got so angry "],["703.44","at them because they wouldn't bow down "],["704.579","to his his golden statue they threw them "],["706.5","in the fire furnace and they're in the "],["708.12","fiery furnace and uh Nebuchadnezzar goes "],["710.76","hey "],["711.66","didn't didn't we throw three guys in the "],["714.36","furnace like yes my leash and he's like "],["716.519","well why am I seeing four and one of "],["719.579","them looks like "],["721.44","the son of God "],["723.42","so there are many of these instances "],["726","where the story speaks of someone who is "],["728.1","mysteriously not human and but "],["730.62","definitely not identified as an angel "],["732.839","and so the theologians have coined a "],["735.18","term you might want to write this down a "],["737.519","theophany what's a theophany it is a "],["741.8","appearance when God makes a physical "],["744.12","appearance to people in the Physical "],["747","Realm so theophonies can be one of three "],["750.92","forms first of all there could be a "],["753.899","non-human form can you think of a a "],["756.779","non-human form of a theophany "],["759.6","God showed up in the burning bush that's "],["763.2","a non-human form the god in the burning "],["765","bush spoke to Moses and then there's "],["768.12","times when the he will show up and it's "],["771.3","called the uh the second type of "],["773.94","theophany is the appearance as the angel "],["777.3","of the Lord this title the angel of the "],["779.88","Lord look at Judges chapter 13. this is "],["782.279","a very very interesting one "],["785.519","all kinds of great Sunday school stories "],["787.62","today packed into this sermon so Judges "],["790.2","chapter 13 this is um the uh this is "],["794.339","about Samson's mom

"],["1504.08","give him a tithe "],["1505.46","so back in Genesis chapter 14 when we "],["1508.7","first read meet Melchizedek what "],["1511.039","happened there do you remember "],["1512.539","so we had four Kings of Canaan and uh "],["1516.32","they say we're gonna get together and "],["1518.539","we're gonna go beat up on the Sodom and "],["1520.159","Gomorrah and those five Kings of the

"],["1544.58","important to Abraham is because his "],["1547.64","nephew lot had where did he go "],["1551.12","he moved down to Sodom and he was living "],["1553.64","in Sodom so when these Kings attacked "],["1556.34","lot got taken captive so Abraham you "],["1559.279","know he's over here hanging out not "],["1560.96","anywhere near that mess and then he "],["1562.88","hears you know oh wow they got locked "],["1564.98","come on boys so he gets his militia "],["1567.2","Abraham's got like 318 armed guys and "],["1570.86","they get all their they get all their "],["1572.72","Firepower

"],["1578.84","and they go chasing after this Army of "],["1581","kings and they they get to them in the "],["1583.22","middle of the night and they craft a "],["1584.72","strategy where they surround

take all the spoils and all the "],["1604.22","captives back Abraham Just Whipped a "],["1606.919","bunch of Kings "],["1608.539","and saved these other kings so he "],["1610.94","whipped Four Kings and saved five Kings "],["1613.1","there's a lot of kings in the story here "],["1614.779","in uh Genesis chapter 14 and then "],["1617.24","Abraham who was no king of himself "],["1618.86","obviously

"],["2178.78","Abraham's paying a tithe to Melchizedek "],["2181.72","that means that Melchizedek is also "],["2184.359","greater than Aaron and therefore "],["2186.52","melchizedek's priesthood is

is without question he's a great "],["2204.82","person "],["2205.599","he's blessed by God "],["2207.22","he is seen as the greatest in the entire "],["2209.8","nation of Israel because he's the

actions of Genesis 14 "],["2229.48","the author says it's obvious that "],["2231.579","Melchizedek is greater than Abraham and "],["2234.64","Since Aaron in his priesthood is in "],["2237.04","Abraham's loins that puts the aaronic "],["2239.44","priesthood on the side of lesser than "],["2243.46","melchizedek's priesthood "],["2246.4","so when the psalmist says in Psalms 110 "],["2249.4","the Messiah is of the priesthood of "],["2251.2","Melchizedek and when the author of "],["2253.119","Hebrews says Jesus of Messiah is in the "],["2255.28","order of the priesthood of

"],["394.8","Hebrews 6 verse 9 about beloved we are "],["397.08","convinced of better things concerning "],["399","you things that accompany salvation "],["401.46","though we are speaking in this way

you have shown "],["411.36","towards his name in having ministered "],["413.58","and in still ministering to the Saints "],["416","and we "],["418.16","desire that each of you show the same "],["421.259","diligence so as to realize the full the "],["424.38","full Assurance of the Hope until the end "],["426.419","so that you will not be sluggish but "],["428.88","imitators of those who

inherit the promises "],["445.38","so I wonder who that was "],["448.62","who's he talking about well good "],["450.479","question the author actually answers and "],["452.759","he gives us an example and here we are "],["454.74","in our new our new passage today verse "],["456.78","13 for when God made the promise to "],["461","Abraham since he could not swear by no "],["463.68","one greater he swore by himself saying I "],["466.979","will bless you and I will surely "],["469.56","multiply you "],["470.94","and so having patiently waited he "],["473.759","obtained the promise "],["475.58","for men swear by ones greater than "],["478.919","themselves and with them an oath given "],["481.319","as confirmation is an end of every "],["484.56","dispute in the same way God Desiring "],["487.62","even more to show to The Heirs of the "],["489.66","promise the unchangeableness of his "],["491.28","purpose interposed with an oath so that "],["494.4","by two unchangeable things in which is "],["496.919","impossible for God to lie we who have "],["500.28","taken Refuge would have strong "],["502.8","encouragement to take hold of the Hope "],["505.56","set before us this hope we have as an "],["508.8","anchor for the soul a hope both sure and "],["511.8","steadfast and one which enters within "],["514.56","the veil where Jesus was entered as the "],["517.5","Forerunner before us becoming a high "],["520.56","priest forever according to the order of "],["523.68","Melchizedek so Abraham "],["527","Abraham is the example of what exactly "],["531","well he is the beginning of something "],["533.279","big that God was going to do and I think "],["537.6","that's the point that the author of "],["539.58","Hebrews is trying to make now I was "],["541.26","tempted to go into an in-depth study of "],["543.36","the life of Abraham but the thing about "],["545.399","Abraham is well just like most of our "],["548.88","Biblical characters and you know just "],["551.22","like our illustration about the FBI "],["553.7","Abraham likewise is a flawed person he "],["557.88","made some very unwise decisions that "],["559.98","resulted in conflict between his heirs "],["562.44","that persist even to this day the Jewish "],["565.56","Arab hostilities has its Genesis back in "],["569.279","the book of "],["570.86","Genesis Abraham had some really good "],["573.72","moments some Mountaintop experiences but "],["576.6","then Abraham also made some really bad "],["578.279","choices and that if we were to study "],["581.399","them we would conclude "],["583.2","that's an example of what not to do "],["585.66","so if I'm going to a long discussion "],["588.42","about The Life and Times of Abraham I "],["590.22","think we will lose the point that the "],["592.86","author is trying to make and that point "],["595.019","is this verse number 10 God is Not "],["599.24","unjust verse number 13 God made the "],["604.14","promise "],["605.48","God swore "],["607.92","by no one greater and he swore by "],["610.26","himself saying I will bless you and I "],["613.14","will multiply you God made "],["616.32","an oath "],["618.899","and God will not lie "],["620.82","while our political "],["623.06","politicians and people in these offices "],["625.38","makos and we're kind of skeptical that "],["628.32","they can commit to them God is Not "],["630.839","unjust the Greek word here is Atticus "],["634.04","means one who deals fraudulently "],["637.019","deceitfully with others God is not that "],["641.399","Numbers Chapter 23 God is not a man that "],["644.64","he should lie or a son of man that he "],["646.86","should change his mind he has said and "],["649.86","will he not do it "],["652.74","or has he spoken and will he not fulfill "],["655.26","it "],["656.94","so "],["658.26","this is the core issue "],["661.079","that is at stake "],["663.54","when we we read last week Genesis "],["666.18","chapter 3 and we talked about the curse "],["668.579","remember "],["669.899","and uh you know the the serpent came to "],["672.36","Eve and said you know did God really say "],["674.579","Don't eat of that tree and he said well "],["676.2","yeah don't eat it or else we'll die and "],["678.779","then the serpent said you won't die God "],["681.12","knows if you eat of that tree your eyes "],["682.8","are going to be open you're gonna become "],["683.76","like God you're gonna do good from Evil "],["685.14","and what kicked off the entire mess of "],["689.7","sin and broken relationship between us "],["692.579","and God was "],["694.56","a lie a lie that resulted in Eve not "],["698.1","believing the word of God "],["700.74","so if I tell you something and you say I "],["703.68","don't believe you basically what you're "],["706.019","implying is you think I'm lying and thus "],["709.62","I'm a "],["710.94","I'm a liar "],["712.56","you can't trust my word now there are "],["715.019","plenty of good reasons why you ought not "],["716.88","trust Pastor Rob first of all I'm very "],["720.18","limited in what I know my expertise is "],["722.579","very restricted and also sometimes I "],["726","misunderstand the things that I think I "],["727.44","know and I may misquote or I might get "],["729.72","confused and unintentionally give you "],["731.64","some misinformation so it's always good "],["733.56","to do your own work and study and know "],["736.26","for yourself also I'm kind of forgetful "],["739.14","you know people will uh come talk to me "],["741.18","on a Sunday and and how all these "],["743.339","requests for me all Sunday long and then "],["745.44","I'll just have to say to people I "],["746.64","learned how to do this I says would you "],["748.68","uh send me an email and put your request "],["751.38","in that because I'm going to forget all "],["752.88","about this conversation before I get out "],["754.5","the door and I need it in writing if you "],["757.019","want me to do anything you better get "],["758.64","that in writing and then you all learned "],["760.86","well don't even tell him just send it to "],["762.6","Suzanne and get her to do it "],["764.76","and on top of all that there is this uh "],["768.42","desire within me to be selfish and want "],["772.8","what I want and and that motivates me to "],["775.68","want to be dishonest we we are all "],["779.1","tempted to be dishonest we we want to "],["781.8","protect our reputation we don't want "],["783.54","people to know the bad things we're "],["786.3","guilty of or sometimes we want to "],["788.88","manipulate a situation so that we could "],["790.5","get our way we might skimp on the truth "],["793.26","embellish the good don't ask don't tell "],["796.32","about the about the bad "],["798.6","we we have to make an effort to tell the "],["801.66","truth but you know I'm no different than "],["803.639","anybody else and when it comes to God "],["806.579","he always means what he says and his "],["811.079","word is true and this is at the heart of "],["815.22","the issue the very core foundational "],["819.54","principle of reality that is always "],["823.26","being put to the test "],["825.36","God said things declared things swore "],["830.279","things and the adversary is working hard "],["834","as he can to make sure those things do "],["836.94","not come to pass why "],["840.12","because if God's word is true and God's "],["844.2","decrees never fail then that means "],["846.54","things that he said would happen to "],["849.06","Satan are going to come to pass turn to "],["852.54","Revelation chapter 20 specifically what "],["854.579","did he say is going to happen to Satan "],["856.74","we know Revelation 20 verse number one "],["860.22","I saw an angel come down from heaven "],["862.139","holding the key to the abyss and a great "],["864.18","chain in

"],["977.519","he's the losing team I don't want to be "],["980.1","on that team "],["981.18","but that doesn't mean Satan accepts his "],["984","fate he has been working for about 6 000

who the author is "],["423.72","dealing with here in chapter six and "],["428.1","to them "],["429.84","he gives a frightening warning "],["433.44","and here it is "],["436.74","Hebrews chapter 6 now verse 4. "],["441.18","four "],["442.44","in the case of those who have once been "],["445.86","enlightened and tasted of the Heavenly "],["448.199","gift and have been made partakers of the "],["450.3","Holy

"],["459.78","unto repentance since they again "],["461.819","crucified to themselves the Son of God "],["463.74","and put him to open shame "],["468.36","so the question this morning is "],["470.84","what makes repentance impossible "],["475.639","impossible anti-dynatos "],["479.52","is the Greek word without strength "],["481.8","impotent powerless unable to be done "],["485.16","the root word is Dino toss "],["487.44","which means able powerful Mighty strong "],["489.599","it's where we get our English word Dino "],["493.74","Dynamite right "],["495.599","one

always like to "],["515.219","imagine the possibilities "],["518.279","and that's something that I think most "],["520.62","humans don't like to be told that "],["522.659","something is impossible "],["525.3","if a person has a vision or idea a dream "],["528.06","they do not want to hear that's "],["530.64","impossible it's an it's impossible to "],["533.16","sail around the world it's

"],["553.92","possibilities "],["555.72","with that being said I think that's "],["558.48","partially why this passage is so very "],["560.94","controversial because he says it is "],["563.16","impossible and that sounds so final the "],["566.279","doors shut no hope or potential "],["570.06","also we don't like the sound of it "],["572.82","because of the subject matter the "],["575.339","author's not talking about sailing or "],["577.56","diving or flying no he's talking about "],["579.899","who can and who cannot repent and "],["583.74","receive forgiveness from their sins who "],["586.14","can and who cannot inherit the kingdom "],["588.6","of God "],["589.62","the author says it is impossible to "],["592.38","renew someone again to repentance "],["596.459","and then he uses "],["597.959","five Clauses to describe this person "],["601.5","which we need to break down in order to "],["604.2","properly identify who this someone is "],["607.62","but the act of trusting in Jesus and "],["610.2","repenting of sins is the most important "],["612.72","decision a person will ever make because "],["615.86","the consequences are so specific and "],["619.62","they're so final because once your life "],["621.839","is over there's no do-overs there's no "],["624.48","Mulligans when we start talking about "],["627.12","one's Eternal Destiny and

their sins man "],["642.24","that's a scary thought "],["644.459","and then on top of that another reason "],["646.44","why people don't like this passage "],["647.88","because when you read it it seems to "],["649.74","communicate that someone who turns for "],["651.66","faith in Jesus "],["652.98","well they can't come back "],["654.899","and and when you have loved ones and

lovely "],["693.36","option "],["695.04","churches have eh that they could just "],["697.62","say ah "],["699","you don't really "],["700.8","you want to cover these verses let's "],["702.839","let's just avoid that and we'll pick "],["705.06","some some topics people like you know "],["706.98","let's stick with the Mel who wants to "],["708.3","hear about the love of God and the "],["711.24","promised blessings oh let's hear more "],["713.76","about those those are tasty milkshakes "],["718.2","and that's going to be my new expression "],["720.48","for the Seeker sensitive

vegan "],["746.76","I'm on a plant-based diet up here "],["749.76","I've developed knowledge and tolerance "],["753.06","so the author gives us an elaborate "],["755.459","description of someone "],["757.2","and the only way to interpret this "],["758.82","passage accurately is we need to look at "],["761.1","the individual Greek words and let the "],["764.639","definitions speak for themselves and "],["766.92","then we need to observe how the author "],["768.6","of Hebrews and the other authors of "],["770.519","scriptures use those terms in other "],["772.5","passages and then we got to remain "],["775.56","consistent "],["777","in our interpretations "],["778.92","so "],["780.24","here's the description right these five "],["783.66","down "],["784.56","enlightened "],["787.019","have tasted the Heavenly gift "],["789.839","been made partakers of the Holy Spirit "],["792.48","tasted the good word of God and the "],["794.459","power of the age to come "],["796.2","a lot of tasting "],["798.18","taste tests going on "],["800.279","so starting off with enlightens "],["802.68","the author of Hebrews used as this word "],["804.72","in chapter 10. if you flip over two "],["807.6","pages to chapter 10 you go down to verse "],["809.459","32 "],["811.019","the author says to his audience "],["813.42","who's the same audience in chapter six

the context he's using the word "],["828.18","enlightened to describe someone who is "],["830.04","believed in Jesus "],["832.519","is the Greek word it means to give light "],["834.899","to shine illuminate "],["836.639","used to Enlighten spiritually to infuse "],["840.3","and instill with the saving knowledge of "],["842.339","who Jesus is that's how it's used in "],["844.74","scripture exactly how John used it in "],["847.5","John chapter 1 verse 1. "],["851.579","flip over there in the beginning was the "],["855.36","word and the Word was with God and the "],["857.459","Word was God the same was in the "],["859.56","beginning with God all things are made "],["861.06","by him part for him was nothing made "],["862.56","that was made in him was life and that "],["864.66","life was the light of man "],["867.24","the light "],["868.86","shines in the darkness in the darkness "],["872.36","comprehends it nods "],["875.1","he continues on and talks about that "],["877.019","light verse number nine "],["879.12","there was a True Light which comes into "],["881.1","the world enlightening every man he was "],["883.68","in the world and the world was made "],["885","through him and the world did not know "],["886.5","him he came to his own and those in who "],["890.1","were his own and they did not receive "],["891.36","him but as many as received him to them "],["894.18","he gave the right to become the children "],["896.22","of God even

verse 14 the "],["908.339","word became flesh and dwelt among us and "],["910.26","we beheld the glory "],["912.12","glory of the only begotten of the father "],["913.98","full of grace and truth "],["916.199","so that's how John uses the term "],["918.839","enlightens the lights and that's also "],["921.6","how Paul uses that term in Ephesians "],["924.72","chapter one for this reason I too having "],["927.779","heard of the faith of the Lord Jesus "],["930.06","Christ which exists among you and your "],["933.24","love for all the saints do not cease "],["935.279","from giving thanks to

author of "],["963.36","Hebrews uses enlightened to refer to "],["967.32","believers "],["968.579","so did John in his description of Jesus "],["971.82","and so does Paul hear in Ephesians talk "],["975.42","about there being enlightened "],["978.18","so maybe enlightened is talking about "],["981.42","people believe in Jesus "],["983.339","that's the first one second is tasted "],["985.98","they tasted the Heavenly gift tasted his "],["988.8","goo o is the Greek word it means to "],["991.62","experience to eat to take nourishments "],["994.8","we see the author of Hebrews used it in "],["997.92","this passage many sermons ago we "],["1000.44","preached this we do we do see him who "],["1003.019","was made little while lower than the "],["1005.36","Angels namingly Jesus because he's "],["1007.88","suffering death crowned with Glory and "],["1011","Honor by the way my good song Choice fit "],["1013.699","right in with that passage from glory to "],["1015.44","glory

"],["1028.939","he nibbled on it "],["1030.86","no he what "],["1032.839","he died he experienced death "],["1037.16","so taste in that sense is he's "],["1040.699","experiencing something so they

do have other "],["1089.84","New Testament authors that use the "],["1092.6","phrase gift and they tell us what they "],["1094.64","mean by Heavenly gift "],["1097.16","Paul does in Ephesians chapter

"],["2169.599","the foundation of repentance and laying "],["2171.64","another one A different one and that "],["2173.92","Foundation of repentance is the Old "],["2176.38","Testament laws "],["2178.9","verse 6 since they again crucified to "],["2182.5","themselves the Son of God putting him to "],["2184.66","open shape what does that mean "],["2186.119","crucifying him again "],["2188.5","well think about it for a moment in the "],["2191.079","context of the audience "],["2193.72","Jesus shows up to Jerusalem on the "],["2197.32","Donkey "],["2198.22","right and the high priest and the "],["2200.74","Pharisees were intimidated by him we "],["2203.619","learned this in Luke right they were "],["2205.06","scared and they were angry that all the "],["2206.68","people were learning about God from "],["2209.02","Jesus and they were losing their "],["2212.5","influence "],["2214.42","and when the religious leaders of Israel "],["2216.64","rejected Jesus as the

what I think the author is "],["2230.74","saying when you reject Jesus as the "],["2232.9","Messiah you are very much acting like "],["2235.3","the high priest you crucify him you're "],["2238.42","concluding Jesus is dead to me "],["2241.42","you destroy his foundation of repentance "],["2243.4","and you lay your own "],["2244.839","so what Peter in Acts preached "],["2247.96","is what the Holy Spirit convicted the "],["2250.54","people of "],["2252.52","so I read that passage you people "],["2255.22","crucified the Messiah "],["2257.44","you need to repent of that "],["2260.079","and when you choose Moses over Jesus you "],["2263.74","fall from that high place basically in "],["2266.8","your heart in your mind you've done that "],["2268.48","very same thing you've crucified him "],["2269.92","again "],["2271.72","so when we as Christians preach Jesus "],["2275.74","crucified when we do this and we look to "],["2278.619","the Cross we're not we're not saying oh "],["2280.839","yeah I align with the high priest we're "],["2283","glad they killed Jesus yeah we celebrate "],["2284.98","the cross because we wanted Jesus dead "],["2286.54","and out

crops have been around for a "],["75.18","long time as people have been riding and "],["77.939","training horses the purpose of the horse "],["80.1","whip is to get the horse's attention a "],["82.619","cue to move in a direction or "],["84.78","communicate you know we need to pick up "],["86.28","the pace maybe out of necessity like in "],["88.799","a war zone the whipping would be more "],["91.92","intense to get the horse really moving "],["94.56","so back before automobiles everyone was "],["97.5","familiar with riding and handling horses "],["100.439","now there is a time when the whip does "],["103.56","not make your horse go faster and that "],["106.32","time is when "],["108.479","the horse is dead you can sit on it and "],["111.119","you can beat it all you want "],["113.939","you're not going anywhere "],["115.799","so that is the imagery and the wisdom "],["118.619","behind the expression we're just beating "],["121.799","a dead horse beating a dead horse is "],["125.159","when someone keeps talking about a "],["127.92","subject that has already been discussed "],["129.959","and decided so my first church in Canada "],["133.44","like most churches that started back in "],["135.84","the 40s they had a history of legalism "],["139.2","so legalism is when churches make up a "],["143.22","bunch of rules about what we should and "],["145.62","should not do as Christians what we "],["147.72","should and should not say and wear and "],["151.44","eat and watch and listen to and read "],["153.18","what we should and should not do in the "],["155.34","church building at the programs on the "],["158.28","property so these rules sometimes "],["161.04","they're connected with Biblical "],["162.06","principles but many times they're not "],["164.22","really connected to biblical principles "],["166.019","they are just views that the previous "],["168.18","leadership had spiritualized one of the "],["171.66","ones that I'm thinking about in "],["173.099","particular was the rule was no "],["176.239","fundraising on the church property "],["179.519","at the time I wanted to have the teens "],["181.98","do a car wash to raise money for their "],["183.84","basketball uniforms and the folks were "],["186.599","okay with the fundraiser but they didn't "],["188.7","want to Don on the actual Church "],["190.26","property and want it done in our parking "],["192.3","lot because in the past a previous "],["194.34","Pastor would not allow fundraising on "],["197.4","the property "],["198.659","citing the story where did he get that "],["200.94","well he was citing the story of Jesus "],["203.34","driving the money changers out of the "],["205.56","temple when he said my house will be a "],["208.26","House of Prayer but you have made it a "],["210.9","den of Thieves we don't want our church "],["213.18","to be identities and everyone "],["216.239","wholeheartedly agreed yes we do not want "],["219.06","our church to be a den of Thieves but is "],["222.9","teens doing a car wash what Jesus was "],["226.5","talking about when he drove out the "],["228.54","money changers "],["230.64","you don't know no of course not that was "],["233.94","not a good application nevertheless some "],["236.879","pastor had taught that so it had stuck "],["239.76","for 30 years will I come along "],["242.34","and I kind of pushed back on that policy "],["245.22","and that poor Doctrine and everyone had "],["247.319","to concede yeah that passage is really "],["250.379","not about teens doing car washes "],["253.86","but the other sticking point was "],["256.739","well we need to be careful "],["259.079","we don't offend anyone "],["260.94","one person in particular always "],["263.699","responded with everything with well we "],["265.8","need to be careful "],["267.3","we don't want to offend anyone "],["269.22","he knew because he'd grown up in that "],["270.96","church he knew all the legalistic rules "],["273.06","he didn't buy into them all but he knew "],["275.94","the people who did "],["278.28","and some of them were his relatives "],["280.86","so he was always concerned about someone "],["283.74","who is going to complain and fuss "],["285.66","because they're offended "],["288.96","so I had to challenge that "],["291","we are the leadership and we are going "],["293.88","to have to lead it's not everyone is "],["296.699","going to agree with every decision that "],["298.68","we make and we we will do our best to "],["300.6","lead with Biblical principles and we'll "],["302.28","try to explain what we're doing and why "],["304.32","and we want to be kind but we just can't "],["307.62","sit here and do nothing and make no "],["310.08","decisions because someone might get "],["312.419","offended "],["313.68","over the course of six years I probably "],["315.72","had that talk with him about three or "],["317.28","four different times and he eventually "],["319.86","learned that I was not going to let him "],["322.02","beat the dead horse of people might get "],["325.74","offended we couldn't let the potentially "],["328.86","offended keep us stuck in the past and "],["332.039","it took a while but he finally got off "],["334.74","that dead horse and moved on with the "],["337.259","rest of us "],["338.58","have you ever been in one of those "],["340.919","situations where someone can't seem to "],["343.56","get their head around new informations "],["345.86","and the decision and move on "],["349.68","apparently the author of Hebrews is "],["352.8","currently in that same situation he's "],["355.5","communicating here in chapter six we "],["358.139","have thoroughly exhausted this topic it "],["362.039","is time to "],["363.66","move

"],["193.92","hand song "],["195.599","recorded 1963 by roy drosky no less "],["199.68","so somebody said when are you going to "],["201.36","do some country music in your sermons so "],["203.04","there you go i did a country song "],["205.44","i'm taking requests now you give me "],["208.48","in the song rose is being made fun of "],["210.72","because of her secondhand clothes "],["212.72","i suppose some people did find it "],["214.48","embarrassing to have secondhand clothes "],["215.76","it never really bothered me when i was a "],["217.04","kid "],["218.159","but you know when you get into high "],["220.08","school you kind of get more brand "],["222.799","conscious "],["224.159","so that's when i started using my "],["226.64","part-time job money to buy clothes that "],["229.92","my folks were not gonna spend good money "],["232.64","on "],["233.68","like levi's jeans or "],["236.48","nikes "],["238.159","my junior year we all were into acid "],["242.4","wash "],["243.84","jean jackets "],["245.439","and jeans "],["247.28","yeah "],["248.239","that was the look right there if you had "],["250.799","some acid wash "],["252.72","you we're cool "],["254.4","so in high school secondhand clothes "],["256.239","were no longer gonna cut it because as a "],["258.239","teen how you were clothed really "],["261.199","affected your degree of attractiveness "],["263.759","so you know i got to get some acid wash "],["266.4","so i can look cool i think that'll work "],["269.04","today "],["270.24","get some acid wash "],["272.639","incidentally somebody in the first "],["273.759","service said i pulled my ass and washed "],["275.44","out the other day "],["276.8","still hasn't come back in style 30 years "],["278.88","later "],["279.759","still not not attractive at all "],["282.639","so "],["284.8","the other week we talked about how "],["286.4","everyone ends up naked "],["288.479","today we're going to talk about how to "],["290.479","be clothed especially how spiritual "],["293.44","leaders are to be clothed so you're "],["296.16","wondering about that title in the "],["297.84","bulletin let's talk about "],["299.84","pastor rob's wardrobe "],["302.32","every high priest taken among men is "],["304.08","appointed on behalf of the people and "],["305.6","things pertaining to god in order to "],["307.6","offer gifts and sacrifices for sin "],["310.4","he can deal gently with the ignorant and "],["312.56","the misguided since he himself is also "],["315.52","clothed the author says clothed in "],["318.4","weakness "],["319.84","and because of it he's a obligated to "],["321.84","offer sacrifices for sins for himself "],["325.44","as well as for the people clothed in "],["328.24","weakness "],["329.28","that i thought that was a ironic phrase "],["331.759","to use in describing the high priest and "],["334.08","his clothing because no doubt jews never "],["338.16","equated the high priest and his clothing "],["341.12","as being weak "],["344.4","since the time of moses the specific "],["347.12","garments that were worn exclusively by "],["349.759","the high priest were called the "],["352.72","holy garments moses first placed them on "],["356","aaron at the consecration of the of of "],["358.639","aaron as the high priest in leviticus "],["360.32","chapter 8 it says then he put "],["364","then he put the tunic on aaron and and "],["366.479","wrapped his waist with the sash and "],["368.639","clothed him with the robe and put the "],["370.16","ephod on him and wrapped his waist with "],["372.24","the artistic band of the ephod with "],["374.8","which he fitted it to him he then placed "],["378","the breastplate on him and in the breast "],["379.68","plate was the urine and the thume he "],["382","also placed a turban on his head and on "],["383.84","the turbine as it "],["385.52","front he placed the golden plate the "],["388.4","holy crown "],["389.919","as just the lord had commanded moses and "],["393.12","aaron wears these garments until his "],["396.4","death "],["397.28","transferring them to his son his "],["399.6","successor eleazar moments before he died "],["403.28","in numbers chapter 20 "],["405.36","the lord says take aaron and his son "],["407.12","eliezer bring him to mel strip "],["409.44","aaron of his garments put them on the "],["411.36","sound eleazar so aaron may be gathered "],["413.919","to his people and he will die there "],["416.72","so moses did as the lord commanded and "],["418.8","went to mount hore in the sight of all "],["420.319","the congregation "],["422.639","and after moses stripped aaron of his "],["424.8","garments put them on eliezer and then "],["427.199","aaron dies right there on the "],["429.84","mountainside and then moses and eleazar "],["432.4","came down from the mountain all success "],["434.72","of high priests are commanded to wear "],["437.52","these clothes so the high priest clothes "],["440.639","are technically "],["442.8","hand-me-downs right they keep handing "],["445.36","them down "],["446.96","the fact that the garments are included "],["448.8","in the instructions of the building of "],["450.319","the temple and its furnishings indicates "],["452.319","that they are not thought of as items "],["453.759","belonging to the priest "],["455.919","rather "],["456.88","as sacred equipment for the temple only "],["460.639","to be used there "],["462.72","they are "],["463.599","explicitly designated to be used when "],["466","serving in the sanctuary according to "],["468.319","the law of moses exodus 29 the holy "],["470","garments aaron shall be for his sons "],["472.72","after him so they may be anointed and "],["475.52","ordained in them for every seven days "],["478.479","the one of his sons who is priest in his "],["480.72","place shall put them on when he enters "],["483.199","the tenant meeting to minister in the "],["485.12","holy place "],["486.56","so these are the garments that they wore "],["488.879","specifically for garments in particular "],["492.08","are unlike any normal articles of "],["494.479","clothing that the people wore their "],["496.16","shape and design showed that they were "],["497.599","not intended to provide protection from "],["499.759","the elements or to fulfill any "],["501.919","requirements for modesty "],["504","in addition to the fabric they contain "],["506.639","gold and precious stones on three of "],["510.479","these garments words are inscribed so "],["513.919","each one of the high priest garments is "],["515.839","said to function in a specific way "],["519.2","whenever the high priest enters the "],["520.959","sanctuary wearing them "],["522.8","the functions of the high priests for "],["525.04","their garments is we'll start with the "],["526.8","ephod "],["527.92","and that's kind of like an apron that is "],["530.32","worn uh there's the robe and then "],["532.56","there's the ephod and then there's the "],["533.92","breastplate on top of that so the "],["536.48","ephod had precious stones inscribed with "],["539.839","the names of the 12 tribes it's said to "],["543.2","serve as the stones of reminder "],["546.399","to remind god of israel and the same is "],["549.92","true of the 12 stones that were on the "],["551.519","breastplate thus by his very person the "],["555.04","high priest personifies the whole of the "],["558.32","israelite people before god standing in "],["562.48","his presence "],["563.76","then there's this breast plate and "],["565.6","particularly it says about the urine and "],["567.68","the thume connected to the breastplate "],["570","these two interesting stones enabled "],["573.04","aaron each time he walked into the "],["574.8","sanctuary to inquire of god the his "],["577.76","specific will on a matter and then the "],["580.64","urim and the thirim were able to "],["582.959","communicate the correct decision from "],["585.44","god himself not sure how those worked "],["587.04","but that's just what the scripture said "],["588.64","they did now the robe that he was "],["590.8","wearing that's that blue part that's "],["592.24","down below the ephod there was bells "],["594.16","attached to that and the reason for that "],["596.24","is when he he he was coming into the "],["598.399","divine presence it would alert the "],["600.72","divine presence of aaron's approaching "],["602.72","so he wouldn't die and if the bell "],["604.8","stopped bringing while he was in there "],["605.92","they know ooh something has happened and "],["608","now we've got to pull "],["609.519","pull the high priest out of there "],["611.6","that's how "],["613.68","careful "],["614.8","how serious it was to go into the "],["616.16","presence of god and then also this this "],["618.32","diadem this turban uh on aaron's head "],["621.76","it it was said that it removed from "],["624.88","god's presence any wrongdoing connected "],["628.72","to israel's offerings and to ensure by "],["631.6","means of the inscription proclaiming "],["633.68","that israel's worship is holy to "],["637.04","yahweh holy to the lord so that god "],["640.079","would graciously accept the sacrifices "],["644.16","so when one considers the daily ritual "],["646.72","acts involving the garments it becomes "],["649.04","clear that they are not viewed as "],["650.64","clothing "],["652.079","they are called garments technically "],["653.68","because he's wearing them but only "],["655.04","because the high priest is bearing them "],["656.88","on his person they transformed the high "],["659.12","priest when he wears them "],["661.6","into a walking embodiment of the whole "],["665.04","nation of israel "],["666.72","so he's literally walking in here with "],["668.399","all this imagery and it plays this "],["670.959","indispensable role in the regular "],["673.279","procession of worship that he's enacting "],["676","on "],["677.12","israel's behalf "],["679.04","so a "],["680.72","crude way of explaining it uh is it's "],["683.76","almost like "],["685.04","when iron man puts on his suit he "],["688.56","becomes a superhero he's really nothing "],["690.8","without the iron man suits so the high "],["692.72","priest when he puts on these special "],["694.64","clothes he then can do all of these "],["697.12","sacred things on behalf of the people so "],["700.079","the clothes are not viewed as weak "],["704.399","back in jesus day the high priest was "],["706.959","the most influential person in the land "],["709.2","oh sure the roman occupiers they had the "],["711.92","army and king herod had some governing "],["714.24","authority but the high priest was the "],["716.399","person who served as mediator between "],["719.2","god and man so he would be the most "],["721.44","revered individual "],["723.839","before the people's eyes he was the "],["726.399","leader of the sanhedrin the religious "],["728.639","council of 70 elders who spiritually led "],["731.279","the nation of israel in jesus time this "],["733.6","would make his words his opinions and "],["736.24","his decrees "],["737.839","most important "],["739.92","not viewed as weak "],["742.32","in jesus time in the time of the writing "],["744","of the book of hebrews the high priest "],["745.92","was no longer "],["747.92","of the line of aaron "],["750","it turns out that king herod the great "],["751.839","and other roman rulers after him saw "],["754.16","this high priest position that would "],["756","that is far too important to just leave "],["758.32","up to the chance of generational "],["760.72","succession so they discontinued the high "],["763.2","priest serving for "],["764.639","life rules instead they installed and "],["767.68","they dismissed high priest at will it "],["770.72","became a political appointment and the "],["773.36","people who got the title were always "],["775.6","from this upper class families who "],["778.24","supported the ruling regime "],["780.8","what the author is talking about here in "],["782.88","chapter 5 is how the high priest was "],["785.279","supposed to function based on the law of "],["787.76","moses he's supposed to be appointed on "],["790.48","behalf of the people and things "],["791.68","pertaining to god in order to offer "],["793.44","gifts and sacrifices for sin he can deal "],["796.48","gently and with the ignorant and the "],["798.48","misguided since he himself is "],["800.72","clothed in weakness "],["802.32","and because of it he is obligated to "],["804.72","offer sacrifices for sin for himself "],["807.519","as well as the people "],["810.56","the high priest the spiritual leader of "],["812.48","israel "],["814.32","ought to be the most aware "],["816.48","of the weaknesses of the individual "],["819.36","the frailties of his own humanity he "],["822.24","ought to be most aware of the "],["824.16","insufficiencies of his own goodness "],["827.12","the high priest's holiness in "],["829.2","righteousness is "],["831.279","weak and puny compared to the glory and "],["834.8","the splendor of god the holiness and the "],["837.76","perfection of god outshines all else he "],["841.519","would know this about himself and like "],["843.92","the prophet isaiah as he comes into the "],["845.839","holy of holies with those bells "],["847.36","reminding him that he might die while "],["848.88","he's in there and they'd have to pull "],["849.839","him out they stopped ringing woe is me "],["852.639","i am undone i am a man of unclean lips "],["855.12","of a people of unclean lips it's a "],["857.04","reality check of who he really is "],["859.519","my eyes have seen the king "],["861.76","we're going into the presence of the "],["863.12","lord of armies "],["865.519","the one who is "],["867.199","close to god "],["868.8","recognizes how weak he himself truly is "],["872.32","like when you stand in front of the "],["874.8","roaring ocean anybody go to the beach "],["876.399","this summer you stand in front of the "],["878.079","ocean doesn't that make you feel small "],["880.079","it's like man this thing is so vast like "],["881.839","if you go

shared their testimonies "],["926.88","last sunday "],["928.8","most people expressed how nervous they "],["930.56","were to stand up and "],["932.399","talk in front of everyone and yet they "],["934.32","they said they felt like it was "],["935.76","important to do so they they felt like "],["937.76","god had given them something to say and "],["940","i absolutely agree with that feeling i "],["942.959","really do believe that the holy spirit "],["944.88","was at work guiding everyone what they "],["947.12","wanted what he wanted them to share i "],["949.12","don't know if you caught it but i i "],["950.399","noticed a running theme in the folks "],["952.48","that shared in the first service and the "],["954.32","same a different theme but a similar "],["956.24","theme and all the people that shared in "],["958.32","the second service "],["959.92","so if god was supplying them with the "],["961.6","material why were they so nervous about "],["964.079","standing up and speaking "],["965.92","well the nerves come with the territory "],["967.68","when you do some public speaking but it "],["969.839","also illustrated something about the "],["971.279","nature and the character

"],["121.74","there's two "],["124.14","school buildings there's the elementary "],["126.6","school that went from "],["128.459","first to fourth grade and that was a "],["130.92","very small building there was no "],["132.06","cafeteria we just we eat in our "],["134.16","classrooms it had an auditorium with a "],["137.16","stage and that's where we would do our "],["139.5","plays and where we would have assemblies "],["141.379","and that room would double as a gym for "],["144.06","gym class but there was no locker rooms "],["146.28","in this building and when you had gym "],["147.9","class you just wore the same clothes "],["149.64","that you came to school in whatever the "],["152.58","games they had planned you just played "],["154.68","them in your jeans or your corduroys or "],["158.28","your polyester slacks that you wore "],["161.58","back in the 70s where a lot of poly "],["164.58","didn't we Dave wore a lot of polyester "],["166.26","slacks back then "],["168.9","but when you went into fifth grade you "],["171.3","went to the high school building across "],["173.4","the river with all the big kids and "],["175.68","things were much different at that "],["177.42","building we had first of all the "],["179.099","cafeteria where we would go and eat our "],["181.08","lunch it had science labs where we had "],["183.84","actually "],["184.8","things in bottles like you know "],["187.04","formaldehyde and gas lines and oh man "],["190.14","that was wild stuff but then we oh we "],["193.14","had a computer room with some "],["195.48","Commodore 64s "],["198.239","only all the old people are laughing at "],["199.98","that nobody else knows what I'm talking "],["201.12","about damn you remember that's what we "],["203.7","had a Commodore 64. wow big tight stuff "],["207.18","eh but the biggest difference was uh in "],["210","the big school was gym class we had "],["213.599","locker rooms and on the day you had gym "],["216.84","you were expected to bring your gym "],["219","clothes and change into your shorts and "],["221.28","your t-shirts before class and they had "],["223.92","the in the locker rooms these big open "],["226.26","group showers now this is a new thing "],["229.44","for 10 year old me this was a place of "],["233.22","some anxiety "],["235.2","first of all I was the only place I ever "],["238.56","changed my clothes was in my own bedroom "],["240.56","I only have an older sister and she had "],["243.48","her own room and I had my own room and I "],["245.939","was used to a lot of privacy changing my "],["248.459","clothes and that wasn't going to be "],["249.959","possible in this gym locker room wasn't "],["252.959","used to that so my first gym class "],["255","locker room experience was very "],["256.5","uncomfortable and I don't think it was "],["258.299","just me that felt that way there was "],["259.56","another kid who he went into the "],["262.32","bathroom to change for some privacy and "],["264.96","then everyone just made fun of him and "],["267.36","so that's the biggest problem about that "],["269.94","age that's the thing you really don't "],["271.199","want is people to make fun of you so no "],["274.32","I'm not gonna go to the bathroom to hide "],["276.54","to change uh but uh you know "],["280.74","it's uh the better concern is what if "],["283.38","people make fun of my chubby body "],["285.54","because it's kind of hard to hide to "],["288","heart all that um hard to hide all that "],["289.919","when you're uh you know sitting there in "],["292.08","your tighty whities "],["295.139","locker room is also a great place for "],["296.639","bullies to act out it's always someone "],["299.4","wanting to give you a wedgie and many "],["301.56","times you had to fight your way out of "],["302.82","the locker room "],["303.96","maybe the clothes are on or not I don't "],["305.46","know but you just had to get out of "],["306.72","there "],["307.8","but you know how it is you get in there "],["309.36","and you look around and nobody's really "],["311.4","feeling that particularly comfortable "],["313.08","and everyone seems a little awkward most "],["314.94","kids just want to get changed and get "],["316.44","out of there so you get used to it after "],["318.479","a week of that it was no longer a "],["320.22","problem but that group shower thing nah "],["324","nobody ever used those we just went back "],["327.78","to class smelly and sweaty but you know "],["331.919","once you get to Junior High you discover "],["333.12","deodorant so you just slap a lot of that "],["335.28","on and then you just smell great you "],["337.38","know Junior High boys lots of deodorant "],["339.18","and body spray "],["342.72","nobody wanted to get Bear Naked "],["345.12","unfortunately what we're gonna learn "],["346.44","about today "],["347.6","everyone ends up naked that does not "],["350.699","sound good at all "],["352.139","when you study the ancient Greeks the "],["354.84","people who first created the gymnasium "],["357.12","and the Olympics it's shocking to learn "],["359.28","that their

"],["376.259","we were still doing it like the ancient "],["377.58","Greeks no thank you that's just weird "],["380.639","I think most people feel that way ever "],["382.8","since the fall of Adam and Eve in the "],["384.3","garden the first thing that was said was "],["386.039","their eyes were open and "],["389.4","they could see they were naked "],["392.039","and they were ashamed "],["393.84","that's pretty much the universal feeling "],["395.4","clothes provide us with covering "],["397.68","protection and they just make us feel "],["400.199","much more comfortable don't you feel "],["401.46","comfortable that I'm wearing a shirt "],["403.16","Montana's like amen you want to see that "],["405.66","exactly I get that that's how we feel "],["408.44","often invading forces when they have "],["411.12","conquered a people and when they were "],["413.039","taking them back into captivity and "],["414.72","slavery they would strip them down as a "],["416.88","way of

"],["425.099","clothed nobody wants to be bare naked "],["428.58","but that's exactly what the word of God "],["432.06","does according to Hebrews chapter 4 "],["434.4","verse 13 it lays all things bare well in "],["439.08","what sense well reviewing the context we "],["441.96","were being warned that people who did "],["443.699","not hang on to their faith in Jesus who "],["445.86","were disobedient and stop believing will "],["448.319","not enter the Eternal rest that Jesus "],["450.36","has prepared for those who trust in him "],["452.46","but one might reason well who knows like "],["455.4","how do you know how can you tell if "],["457.62","someone's believing or unbelieving how "],["459.06","do you know if someone is not going to "],["460.979","enter the rest or not all kinds of "],["463.44","people at one time in their lives were "],["465","very devoted and committed followers of "],["467.039","Jesus they're on fire for the Lord "],["469.8","that's how we used to describe it the "],["471.12","preachers would get up and they would "],["472.259","challenge us to be on fire for Jesus "],["475.199","that meant you were passionate "],["477.479","that means you were always reading your "],["480.18","Bible and praying you would complete all "],["483","your Awana books memorize every verse "],["486.06","and win all the awards my one friend he "],["489.72","won

"],["1282.08","God will the word of God will "],["1285.26","cut down penetrating dividing Soul and "],["1288.799","Spirit so that point this passage tells "],["1292.1","you that there's a divide

right the "],["1303.44","people who are trichotomists they "],["1305.48","believe that the physical body connects "],["1307.28","us to the physical world the soul is the "],["1310.22","essence that God breathes in if "],["1312.32","somebody's alive their soul is in there "],["1314.36","and the spirit "],["1316.46","is what connects them to God "],["1318.44","that you can be physically alive but "],["1320.96","spiritually dead we see this coming out "],["1323.179","of like Ephesians where he says you who "],["1325.88","were "],["1326.96","you were dead in your offenses and sins "],["1329","in which you previously walked according "],["1330.74","to the course of this world according to "],["1331.94","the prince and the power of the air the "],["1333.2","spirit that is now working in the

part "],["1378.799","of the soul that is connected with God "],["1381.2","so the question of dichotomy versus "],["1383.299","trichotomy is essentially whether the "],["1385.28","soul and the spirit are different "],["1386.659","aspects of the immaterial human nature "],["1389.72","or if the spirit is simply part of the "],["1392.12","Soul with the soul being the whole "],["1393.919","immaterial

from a place of "],["344.639","unbelief what we want what we ask for "],["348.96","is not what we need "],["351.419","so The Story Goes a well-to-do lady was "],["354.36","traveling on a train with

come short of it be afraid "],["720.54","of that "],["721.44","well what does that look like what does "],["722.639","that mean coming short of the promise to "],["724.68","enter rest we have to define the terms "],["726.779","now the audience we have to remember are "],["732.48","the book of the is called Hebrews the "],["735.3","audiences Hebrews thank you Daniel "],["737.519","appreciate that that was good Bible "],["739.079","knowledge coming out there the author "],["741.54","are Hebrews they're Jews the the "],["743.399","audience are Hebrews and they have a "],["745.56","preconceived idea of what words like the "],["748.38","rest and the promise is when they hear "],["752.519","promise they are people of Covenant and "],["755.94","they think of the covenants that God "],["757.98","made with Abraham and Moses and David "],["760.44","and they think of those promises the "],["762.959","promises of "],["764.7","Moses abrahamic Covenant land "],["767.88","seed and blessings on the descendants of "],["770.88","Abraham we will not be slaves we will "],["773.279","not be ruled by hostile Nations we will "],["775.38","be free in our own land we will have a "],["777.72","king the davidic covenants will have a "],["779.94","king that will conquer all of our "],["781.56","enemies and he will rule according to "],["783.36","our laws and our customs and we will be "],["785.82","great and we will rule the world that's "],["788.1","their idea of promise and rest rests "],["790.92","from being oppressed rests from having "],["792.48","to pay taxes also when they heard the "],["794.579","rest they would think of the Sabbath day "],["797.639","the day of "],["799.2","rest right "],["800.94","God created the world in six days and on "],["803.22","the "],["803.94","seventh he rested "],["807","I think the next couple of verses the "],["809.339","author is expanding the audience's "],["811.56","understanding of what the promise is and "],["814.079","what rest is and it was going to seem "],["816.54","kind of basic to some of us but we need "],["818.76","to cover the the detailed argument here "],["820.68","in Hebrews so chapter 4 verse 2 for "],["824.1","indeed "],["825.36","we have had good news preached to us "],["827.839","just as they also "],["830.76","who's just as they also "],["833.579","well the people that came out of Egypt "],["835.98","right those people back then "],["837.959","they they were the people that we were "],["839.699","talking about in chapter three "],["841.98","uh they also uh provoked God to wrath "],["846.18","and did not enter the land "],["847.8","they had the good news of the land and "],["849.66","rest they didn't get it the information "],["851.82","didn't profit them why "],["855.18","because it was not "],["857.16","United with faith verse two for indeed "],["861.48","they had the good news preached to us "],["862.8","just as they but the word they heard did "],["865.32","not profit them because it was not "],["866.76","United by faith in those who heard "],["872.76","so the information didn't profit them "],["874.92","that was chapter 3 verse 19. so we see "],["877.26","they were not able to enter why because "],["879.6","of unbelief Don't Stop Believing but "],["881.399","then the audience here in Hebrews uh "],["883.98","could argue "],["885.3","the the the Jews could argue yeah but "],["887.88","where are they now well we're in our "],["890.04","land right Joshua and our ancestors that "],["892.8","that generation didn't get in but Joshua "],["894.959","and our ancestors got in and look here "],["896.639","we are we're now living in the land we "],["899.1","enter God's rest so we're good right "],["903.12","verse 3 for we who have believed entered "],["906.779","that rest notice the believing is "],["908.519","connected to the rest "],["910.199","just as he said as I swore in my wrath "],["912.66","they shall not enter my rest "],["916.98","what does that mean "],["919.68","we who have believed enter the rest in "],["921.48","what sense are we talking about land "],["923.279","are we talking about abrahamian Covenant "],["924.839","rest from wilderness wanderings "],["927.42","how have we entered the rest "],["929.759","so this is where the author is expanding "],["931.56","the audience understanding of what rest "],["934.019","is verse number four "],["937.56","for he said some wheres concerning the "],["939.899","seventh day God rested on the seventh "],["942.36","day from all his works and again In this "],["944.16","passage they will not enter my rest "],["946.259","therefore since it remains for some to "],["948.42","enter it "],["949.56","and those who formerly had the good news "],["951.48","preached to them failed to enter Because "],["953.399","of disobedience "],["956.04","so this declaration they should all "],["958.74","enter my rest it's not just that "],["961.38","generation that Moses is leading "],["964.259","it's for us as well "],["966.36","rest is more than just the physical "],["970.339","Promised Land there's this ultimate rest "],["973.92","that God is enjoying that's connected to "],["976.5","himself hence the title the rest is yet "],["980.339","to come "],["981.48","verse number four his work was completed "],["984.36","and he rested this is the point he's "],["986.279","making God rested on the seventh day "],["988.32","from his work so "],["990.36","when he speaks of rest there a verb God "],["993.54","rested but then he says they will not "],["995.579","enter my rest and when he says my rest "],["998.88","is not an action it's not a verb of "],["1000.86","resting it's a noun the rest "],["1004.519","is well the Heavenly blessings which God "],["1007.82","is where he's dwelling in what he's "],["1009.8","doing and he promises that to the "],["1012.98","preserving believer in Christ to partake "],["1015.8","on that after our toil and our labor is "],["1018.8","done on Earth then that's the ultimate "],["1020.72","rest we're looking forward to "],["1022.579","and you know how we have said going "],["1026.539","through this study the point of Hebrews "],["1028.64","is to teach how Jesus is better that "],["1030.98","Jesus is greater than the old Jewish "],["1033.799","system will this rest that Jesus is "],["1036.74","leading to is better is greater than the "],["1040.819","promised land that the Israelites were "],["1043.819","trying to get into so getting the "],["1045.439","promised land is not the final rest that "],["1048.02","the audience should be focused on that's "],["1050.179","just a partial rest the rest is yet "],["1054.08","to come here's the author's evidence "],["1056.84","here's how he proves his point with this "],["1059.12","logic following so verse number four he "],["1061.7","said some words concerning the seventh "],["1063.08","day God rested on the seventh day from "],["1065.179","his work so the concept of rest first of "],["1068.179","all pre-dates "],["1070.039","the land "],["1071.78","because God rested before there was any "],["1074.72","concept of Promised Land God didn't "],["1076.64","answer Canaan land to rest "],["1079.34","so rest is not simply a location "],["1082.4","if I was going to tell you about my home "],["1084.26","I could be talking about my address down "],["1087.2","in Piney Point some Billy Morgan our "],["1089.36","missionary last week came and stayed "],["1090.86","with me in my home "],["1092.6","what do you think okay he's down at "],["1094.1","Piney Point or I also could be not "],["1097.039","talking about my address in Piney Point "],["1099.5","maybe I'm referring to my home when I "],["1102.679","was in Canada I could stay home and be "],["1104.72","talking back home if I say back home you "],["1106.46","guys say oh he's telling Canadian "],["1107.78","stories again eh that's he's going to "],["1109.28","talk about right uh or I could be "],["1111.14","talking about my family unit my home uh "],["1113.66","my my it could be my wife and kids or "],["1116.48","what if I'm talking about uh my where I "],["1119.36","grew up and it's like okay or is that "],["1121.76","your parents or is that your trailer "],["1122.84","home is not simply an address is it "],["1125.299","that's not how we use it rest is not "],["1127.94","simply a location the Jews were in the "],["1130.58","promised land and yet "],["1132.98","they may not enter God's rest "],["1135.38","this is the point he's making the "],["1137","authors referencing something David said "],["1139.4","to prove his point in verse number five "],["1142.22","Again In this passage they shall not "],["1144.62","enter my rest well he's quoting Psalms "],["1146.96","95 where David says come let us worship "],["1149.96","and bow down let's kneel before the Lord "],["1151.46","Our God our maker for he's our God and "],["1153.919","we are his people of his Pastor we're "],["1155.419","the Sheep of his hand today now listen "],["1158.36","to this this is the logic he says today "],["1160.34","if you hear his voice don't Harden your "],["1162.799","heart as they did in the wilderness "],["1164.36","tested him and tested his works for 40 "],["1166.64","years God was disgusted with that "],["1168.679","generation and said that they are my "],["1170.66","people who air in their heart they did "],["1172.34","not know my way therefore I swore in my "],["1174.5","anger they will not enter my rest "],["1177.44","so David applied that passage to the "],["1179.6","people in his time David was warning the "],["1181.64","people there "],["1183.14","in his day who were in The Promised Land "],["1186.5","who did have a righteous King the nation "],["1189.44","of Israel was not under servitude of "],["1191.72","Rome or a foreign power when David was "],["1193.76","on the throne that era think about it "],["1196.28","would have been seen by the Jews as the "],["1198.679","ideal time one of the greatest glorious "],["1201.02","times that the nation ever enjoyed they "],["1203.059","had the covenants they had the promises "],["1204.799","of God they had a righteous King and "],["1206.659","even in that time David warns them today "],["1209.299","don't Harden your heart "],["1211.46","or you may not get the rest but David "],["1213.98","wait we're in the land you're our King "],["1216.62","how's it possible that we would not have "],["1218.659","the rest when we're already here "],["1221","well The Logical answer is because this "],["1223.82","is not all that rest is "],["1226.58","and once again "],["1228.559","you can say it with me the rest is yet "],["1231.44","to come "],["1233.059","verse six therefore since it remains for "],["1236.72","some to enter "],["1238.88","and those who formerly had the good news "],["1240.74","preach to them failed to enter Because "],["1242.72","of disobedience "],["1244.22","he again fixes a certain day today "],["1246.2","saying through David after so long a "],["1248.6","time just as he said before today if you "],["1251.84","hear my voice do not Harden your heart "],["1253.7","for Joshua had given them the rest "],["1256.28","he would not have spoken of another day "],["1257.84","after that "],["1259.4","so verse 7 the warning spoken to Exodus "],["1263.419","was still relevant to the people in "],["1265.22","David's day "],["1266.659","even after so long a Time "],["1269.419","and the warning is still relevant for "],["1271.22","the current Hebrew audience in uh was "],["1275.12","that I tell you this was 65 65 A.D and "],["1278.48","the warning is still relevant to "],["1281.36","St Mary's audience in 2022. "],["1285.2","verse number eight "],["1286.82","says the logic if Joshua got them giving "],["1290.059","them the rest "],["1291.2","they wouldn't have spoken of another day "],["1292.58","after that "],["1293.84","so there's more rest to come verse 9. so "],["1296.419","there remains a rest a Sabbath rest for "],["1299.9","the people of God "],["1301.88","so when they say Sabbath "],["1304.82","when we say Sabbath we automatically "],["1306.38","think what "],["1308.6","a day right the last day of a seven week "],["1312.02","there's a one 24-hour period of time at "],["1314.72","the end of your week which is the "],["1315.98","Sabbath rest and that makes sense "],["1318.2","because the seventh day is called the "],["1320.6","Sabbath day but Sabbath does not just "],["1323.659","mean day the word Sabbath can be used to "],["1326.48","modify a year we see this in Leviticus "],["1329.72","chapter 25 where God provides "],["1332.36","instructions for the Sabbath year to be "],["1335","observed by the Israelites when they "],["1336.86","were in the promised land so it says "],["1339.26","that if you for six years sow your "],["1341.48","fields for six years prune your "],["1343.28","Vineyards gather your crops but on the "],["1345.26","seventh year the land is to have a what "],["1348.74","a Sabbath rest a Sabbath to the Lord do "],["1352.28","not sow your fields or prune Vineyards "],["1354.2","do not reap or groan of itself or the "],["1356.96","Harvest and greats or the unattended "],["1358.82","Vines the land is to have a year of rest "],["1360.679","so every seventh year there was to be a "],["1363.62","time where they didn't plant or prune "],["1365.78","the crops and the the Sabbath day was "],["1369.44","the rest every week and this rest "],["1371.539","applied to the Farmland once every seven "],["1374.059","years "],["1375.32","a Sabbath year was also when they were "],["1377.9","supposed to let the slaves go and free "],["1381.559","everybody of debt and I think we should "],["1383.84","still do that amen yeah wouldn't that be "],["1386","great if you could get uh seven seven "],["1388.1","years in your mortgage and no it's a "],["1389.659","Sabbath year I just bought the house in "],["1391.4","the six year too bad it's uh free right "],["1393.919","that incidentally you we do still see "],["1396.14","the remnants of that in our culture "],["1397.58","because they tell you if you um if you "],["1400.28","go bankrupt you'll have bad credit for "],["1402.32","how long "],["1403.22","seven years right so you got to endure "],["1404.96","seven years and then you're free from "],["1406.58","your bad credit after seven years that "],["1408.2","ties back into that biblical concept "],["1412.46","so the rest is not just location "],["1415.58","and cyber press is not just a day "],["1418.28","it's more "],["1420.5","I want to show you another little Rabbit "],["1422.659","Trail interesting pattern of the seven "],["1424.7","days of creation "],["1426.98","um "],["1427.64","second Peter chapter 3 "],["1430.159","Peter says but do not overlook this one "],["1432.14","fact beloved that with the Lord one day "],["1435.32","is as a thousand years and a thousand "],["1437.659","years is a day and we say well you know "],["1439.1","because God's Eternal a thousand years "],["1440.84","is nothing to him or that's that's a "],["1443.539","that's a good way to take that but also "],["1444.919","some people take it very literally the "],["1446.96","ancient Jews "],["1448.46","they believed that Humanity has 7 000 "],["1452.779","years total "],["1454.1","that's going to be the the scope of all "],["1456.98","of humanity six thousand years of toil "],["1460.159","and labor under the rule of

year reign because it's spoken "],["1476.179","of in Revelation chapter 20 when uh it "],["1479.059","says I saw an angel come down from "],["1480.62","heaven holding the keys of the abyss and "],["1482.9","the great chain in his hand and he took "],["1484.76","hold a dragon The Serpent of old who's "],["1486.799","the devil and Satan and bound him for a "],["1489.919","thousand years and he threw him into the "],["1491.779","abyss and shut it and sealed it over him "],["1493.82","he would not deceive the Nations any "],["1495.559","longer until that thousand years we call "],["1498.08","that the millennial Kingdom the right "],["1500","the Earthly rule of Jesus comes to an "],["1503.419","end "],["1504.44","so that's an interesting Theory there is "],["1507.32","a total of seven thousand years pre pre "],["1509.9","preordained for the world six thousands "],["1512.36","of sinful uh existence and then a "],["1515","thousand righteous rule of the Messiah "],["1516.86","since the creation of Adam "],["1519.62","till Jesus Christ the scholars say that "],["1522.74","that was approximately four thousand "],["1524.539","years "],["1526.1","so "],["1527.12","is there only two thousand years left "],["1529.46","before the millennial Kingdom "],["1533.12","this is uh what 20 "],["1536.299","22 according to our Roman Greco calendar "],["1540.44","Scholars speculate that Jesus was "],["1542.36","crucified in 29 or 30 A.D not 100 sure "],["1545.539","if that's when the 2000 year started and "],["1549.08","we know that there's a seven year Great "],["1550.52","Tribulation before the second coming of "],["1552.02","Jesus then maybe the Great Tribulation "],["1554.299","starts "],["1556.34","the fall of this year "],["1558.62","or maybe next year "],["1561.5","that would be six thousand years of "],["1563.9","Fallen human history and one final "],["1565.64","Thousand Years a sabbatical Millennial

can't be "],["1577.039","dogmatic about that but Jesus did tell "],["1579.26","us two what watch and be ready so always "],["1584.36","watching and being ready okay that was a "],["1586.7","crazy blew your mind there you can talk "],["1588.5","more about that later for verse 10 for "],["1591.32","the one who has entered his rest has "],["1593.659","himself also rested from his works as "],["1596.36","God did from his "],["1598.34","so the Greek word used here translated "],["1602","into the English work is ergon and when "],["1605.419","you go to your Greek Septuagint that's "],["1607.279","your Old Testament uh Hebrew translated "],["1610.279","into Greek the same Greek word ergon was "],["1614.299","used in Genesis chapter 3 verse 17 where "],["1617.539","the curse was placed on Adam where it "],["1620.84","says then to Adam he said because you "],["1623.299","listen to the voice of your wife and a "],["1625.159","beaten of the tree so listening to his "],["1627.02","wife got him in trouble the reverse is "],["1628.4","now true if I listen to my wife I get "],["1629.84","out of trouble so that's important tip "],["1631.58","it for all you guys out there but "],["1633.559","because you listen to her and you ate "],["1634.76","from the trees I commanded you you shall "],["1636.5","not eat of cursed is the ground because "],["1638.6","of you with

the Greek word in the Greek "],["1651.02","Septuagint there the toil the labor the "],["1653.24","painful work there is coming a rest when "],["1656.419","we will be free from the curse we will "],["1660.2","have rest verse 10 says from our work as "],["1663.38","God did Will that only be for a day "],["1668.299","or a year "],["1670.94","before man fell "],["1673.399","they were living in

sin and also came the "],["1688.279","separation from God but God meanwhile "],["1691.22","he's abiding in his rest on the seventh "],["1693.14","day he rested and he's continuing on "],["1694.7","ongoing rest our sin separates us from "],["1697.88","God and his rest and thus our painful "],["1701.779","labor for the guys the toil for the "],["1704.179","women "],["1705.08","there's another whole worst painful "],["1706.94","labor isn't it and that's the part of "],["1708.86","the curse the child bearing "],["1710.779","so think about this back when the nation "],["1713.24","of Israel was slaves in Egypt they never "],["1715.88","would have been allowed to have a day "],["1717.26","off "],["1717.98","they were never given a rest they would "],["1719.659","have had to work whenever they were told "],["1721.34","to work forever long they were told to "],["1723.38","work rest would have been impossible for "],["1725.48","them but once they

"],["617.04","version the nasby that i'm reading uh "],["620.16","capitalized all the "],["622.079","third-person singular pronouns the he's "],["624.8","in his anybody else got them capitalized "],["626.88","in theirs okay some of you got those "],["628.079","capitalized that's because "],["630.079","they the um interpreter is telling you "],["634","those pronouns are in reference to

"],["674.64","interpretation is what what the author "],["676.72","is trying to communicate well i believe "],["678.24","so because verse number four for every "],["680.32","house is built by some man but he that "],["682.48","builds all things is "],["685.12","is god right "],["687.2","so i think that kind of sums it up there "],["690.079","judah israel the hebrew people the

"],["716.16","the author's point here is moses as "],["718.32","great as he was "],["719.68","was part of the house what do you say "],["721.519","what what do you call him a "],["723.68","a servant in the house jesus on the "],["726.48","other hand he called a what "],["729.519","a son so in heir "],["732.399","to the the house the son of the builder "],["736.32","and he's counted more worthy "],["738.399","than from counted worthy of more glory "],["740.88","which was a great choice of songs that "],["742.24","we sang here because that really tied in "],["744.24","with this passage well so the builder "],["745.839","the owner of the house is god jesus is "],["748","the son the heir so where is moses in "],["750.639","comparison in the hierarchy "],["752.8","compared to jesus "],["755.44","he's worthy of more glory the author of "],["758.16","hebrews says once again "],["760.399","our audience "],["762.16","is contemplating abandoning jesus "],["764.88","not holding fast

"],["776.48","and they're telling themselves well i'm "],["777.92","not disobeying god we're being faithful "],["779.92","to god because we're following moses and "],["782.079","the laws of moses and that's always been "],["784","the way to god so we're okay we're good "],["787.6","and the author says no "],["789.839","moses "],["791.279","is not the builder of the house "],["793.36","moses is not the son you can't reject "],["795.6","the son the will of the father and say "],["797.68","moses said so moses is just a servant "],["802.48","so "],["803.2","my home is down in piney point and it's "],["805.44","part of a community of 26 other homes in "],["808.72","the communities called potomac beach "],["811.04","and all 25 homeowners along with me have "],["814.56","joint ownership over what the hoa calls "],["817.92","common area "],["819.279","common area is all the land the "],["821.6","driveways the grass the dumpster the "],["824.079","beach and the pier "],["825.44","and we all pay

common area and "],["835.519","the hoa has to cut it and that's what "],["837.44","the dues go to so that's cool "],["839.839","so my it's it's my beach and my peer "],["842.32","along with the other homeowners and we "],["843.76","share and we can invite our friends over "],["845.6","to uh visit with us on our beach for the "],["847.76","most part i know "],["849.519","my 25 other neighbors "],["851.6","i don't know all of their family and "],["853.199","friends "],["854.24","and sometimes i'll see someone i don't "],["856.24","recognize on the beach "],["857.839","and uh you know i'll say who's that on "],["860.16","the beach "],["861.04","you know the binoculars "],["863.92","you got to keep an eye on these things "],["865.279","you know i'm i'm the president of this "],["867.12","hoa hey i got i got to make sure "],["869.519","people on the beach shouldn't be there "],["870.88","and it's like oh well i recognize okay "],["872.56","well i recognize that's uh that's dawn "],["874.399","and deb okay says don and deb's family "],["876","all right good don't have to go get them "],["879.04","however every once in a while there's "],["880.8","people outside our community who wander "],["882.56","down to our beach and use our pier and "],["884.72","uh because they just assume it's open to "],["886.16","the public so one day i'm on the pier "],["888.32","and there's this guy and his girlfriend "],["889.68","and some kids with them and none of my "],["891.44","neighbors are there it's just these "],["892.88","people alone "],["894","and uh so i i says uh in a friendly yet "],["898.399","direct manner "],["899.68","uh hey where do you guys live where are "],["901.519","you from and uh as i suspected they "],["903.92","weren't from our community and the lady "],["905.279","says oh well we live in this community "],["906.639","over here but my friend said that this "],["909.279","beach and pier is open to all of us to "],["911.519","use and i said oh i'm so sorry this is a "],["914.48","a private property and it's only to be "],["916.56","used by the residents of potomac beach "],["918.72","which by the way is exactly what the "],["920.24","sign says that's posted on the beach and "],["922.32","on the pier right there "],["925.279","their friend from another community "],["926.959","misinformed them she did not have any "],["929.44","ownership and that she has no authority "],["932.24","to make such a claim however me a legal "],["935.199","owner of beach and peer has more "],["938.16","authority than the word of her friend "],["940.16","all her friend was giving her was "],["942.24","wishful thinking "],["944.079","but it wasn't true "],["945.759","after i corrected the false narrative "],["947.759","about the legal access to the beach i "],["949.519","said well you folks have a nice day and "],["951.04","i walked away and i didn't try to run "],["952.32","them off or you know do a citizen's "],["954.079","arrest or anything like that i i just "],["956","left them to decide uh what they would "],["958.56","do what action they would take based on "],["960.079","the information i gave them to their "],["961.36","credit they rounded up their kids and "],["962.56","they left without offense the point is "],["965.519","if someone is the owner they have "],["968.639","authority over the property "],["971.199","so these people that the author of "],["972.8","hebrews is speaking to are acting like "],["974.72","the trespassers oh my friend says it's "],["977.36","okay moses says well first of all moses "],["980.079","is not god and second of all moses never "],["983.12","said he has authority over god he never "],["985.44","said it's his house "],["987.44","verse four "],["988.88","the builder of all things is "],["991.759","god and that statement right there just "],["993.92","move this discussion over here to 2022. "],["998.079","you know house of judah house of israel "],["999.839","moses old testament whatever what's that "],["1001.6","going to do with me "],["1003.12","god is the builder of all things meaning "],["1005.44","god is the "],["1007.519","owner of all things and the official "],["1010.72","theological word is god is sovereign "],["1013.68","he's sovereign over all "],["1016.399","this is as much "],["1018.079","a commentary about our lives "],["1021.44","as it is about "],["1022.8","the hebrews lives really do we see that "],["1025.039","anywhere else is the house of god used "],["1027.36","to relate to churches or christians in "],["1030.16","other passages of scripture well paul "],["1032.4","uses that imagery doesn't he in "],["1034.4","ephesians he says then you are no longer "],["1037.28","strangers and foreigners but you are "],["1039.199","fellow citizens and saints and we are "],["1042.16","of the "],["1043.6","of god's household having been built on "],["1045.839","the foundation the apostles the prophets "],["1047.679","christ jesus itself being the "],["1049.44","cornerstone in whom the whole building "],["1052.08","being fitted together is growing into a "],["1054.16","holy temple in the lord in whom "],["1056.88","you also are being built together "],["1059.52","into a dwelling place of god in the "],["1061.36","spirit "],["1062.96","so "],["1064.32","jesus is the chief cornerstone the "],["1066.32","apostles are the foundation and then all "],["1068.64","of us we're all part fitting together "],["1072.16","built on christ and peter uses the same "],["1074.72","illustration in first peter chapter 2 "],["1077.039","and coming to him as to a living stone "],["1080.559","which has been rejected by man but his "],["1082.799","choice impressions in the sight of god "],["1085.039","you also as living stones are being "],["1088.32","built up as a here it is "],["1091.12","spiritual house for a holy priesthood to "],["1093.679","offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable "],["1096.08","to god through "],["1097.6","jesus christ "],["1098.88","so living stone stacked them on top of "],["1100.72","another building a spiritual house and "],["1103.28","then paul "],["1104.72","by the way even points "],["1106.48","to the fact that our bodies are "],["1108.64","in fact tabernacles they are living "],["1111.52","literal temples dwelling places for the "],["1113.36","third part member of the holy trinity "],["1115.76","first corinthians chapter six or do you "],["1118.4","not know that your body is a temple of "],["1120.96","the holy spirit who is in you whom you "],["1123.28","have from god that you are not your own "],["1127.919","so the idea of being a spiritual house "],["1129.84","is both symbolic and literal "],["1132","we are living stones joined together to "],["1135.12","form this household we are literally the "],["1138.32","dwelling place of the holy spirit okay "],["1140.16","so what does that mean am i a wallpaper "],["1143.2","that's just supposed to hang around and "],["1144.32","do nothing "],["1145.6","am i the floor that everybody's gonna

and they "],["1191.919","bought this land and then they built a "],["1194.24","farm and they had three kids and two of "],["1196.32","the boys "],["1197.36","worked with their dad on the farm and "],["1199.679","once the boys grew up and and they "],["1201.12","wanted to get married conrad went out "],["1202.72","and bought houses right on the same road "],["1205.039","as the farm and um "],["1207.6","for the boys and their wives the farm "],["1209.679","conrad and minnie owned everything all "],["1212.48","the barns the livestock the equipment "],["1214.799","and the houses for their sons and their "],["1217.12","own house but once the boys came of age "],["1219.52","conrad then gave them a percentage a "],["1222","part ownership in all of it so they were "],["1224.559","more than just the kids they were more "],["1226.08","than just employees they had ownership "],["1228.72","and thus inheritance "],["1231.2","in the farm and once the boys got "],["1233.039","married and their their wives likewise "],["1234.799","would pitch in with the farming "],["1236.48","especially during hay season comrade and "],["1239.2","the boys would drive all the the "],["1240.96","tractors and the in the uh expensive "],["1242.88","farm equipment but us farm hands they "],["1244.88","just stuff us up in a hay mound and "],["1246.4","throw bales and hate us and we're "],["1247.679","supposed to figure out how to how to get "],["1249.2","them all packed in there and this would "],["1250.96","go on all day long and into the evening "],["1252.72","until the barns were full of hay it was "],["1254.32","a big job and the good crew is needed "],["1257.44","so we work all afternoon then we take a "],["1259.2","break for supper and then minnie and "],["1261.2","their daughter-in-laws they would they "],["1262.64","would bring this big supper out for us "],["1264.4","and we'd kind of sit out there in the "],["1265.6","lawn and uh you know it'd be just "],["1267.919","everything you'd expect from a big "],["1269.84","canadian meal roast beef and gravy and "],["1272.559","and vegetables and then because in cold "],["1274.96","countries we pickle everything so all "],["1276.64","kinds of preserves and homemade breads "],["1279.039","and oh i'm hungry now why did i do that "],["1282.96","so good "],["1285.2","we need an auction or something we could "],["1286.48","get some smoked meat or something right "],["1288.159","jennifer yeah so it was just be this big "],["1290.4","supper it'd be like 20 30 people eh "],["1292.24","because you'd have all their families "],["1293.679","and then all the farmhands "],["1295.28","and uh as time went on eventually derek "],["1297.84","the youngest bought these aging parents "],["1300.24","out and the

"],["1308.799","and minnie they stayed in their home and "],["1310.4","they helped out as much as they were "],["1311.679","able so the most family farm "],["1315.36","continues on passing down from

i think "],["135.28","this has been a good use of my time is "],["137.76","because i believe the bible is the word "],["141.28","of god "],["142.4","and god has "],["144.08","told us in his word about

"],["710.959","eternal kingdom is very much building "],["713.2","something "],["714.32","for us as well being cheap and "],["716.959","disinterested being derelict in our duty "],["719.839","of

"],["810.959","with my weirdness and my title but try "],["813.2","as me way try as we may there is no way "],["815.92","around the fact that as followers of "],["818.399","jesus we are not going to fit in with "],["820.48","the world we're going to be set apart "],["823.44","which is another reason why we need to "],["825.279","be close as a family our biological "],["828.079","families can shun

"],["906.32","that's one of the reasons why people "],["907.839","think paul may be the author of hebrews "],["910.079","is because of these reoccurring themes "],["911.6","and phrases appear also in paul's "],["913.76","writings of his other books the greek "],["916.16","word for calling is clasis "],["920.399","means invitation or "],["922.399","vocation in "],["924.24","english those are two

"],["924.32","all kinds of things about spirit beings "],["928.24","and we call them angels "],["930.399","where did these angels come from "],["932.48","well it tells us in colossians that they

"],["953.6","and "],["954.48","for him the bible states clearly that "],["957.12","all creatures "],["958.56","were created by god so angels were "],["960.32","created by god "],["961.759","and what

"],["979.68","you like to know what they're doing "],["980.88","let's talk about that for a minute "],["982.959","angels are spirit beings they inhabit "],["984.959","the spiritual realm called heaven "],["988.16","paul writes even if us or an angel from "],["991.36","heaven should preach any other gospel "],["994.079","contrary to what we preached to you let "],["995.92","him be accursed so

in luke chapter 20 they says for the "],["1007.68","talking about the resurrected they "],["1009.04","cannot die anymore they are like the "],["1010.639","angels they are sons of god being sons "],["1013.36","of the resurrection "],["1015.519","so they're immortal but we do see in "],["1017.759","scripture they have limits uh one of the "],["1020.16","examples of that is they can only be in "],["1021.92","one place at one time like in daniel "],["1024.559","chapter 10 this is a very interesting "],["1026.4","story in daniel chapter 10 uh daniel was "],["1029.6","trying to get a message from god and and "],["1031.76","this angel comes to him and says don't "],["1033.439","be afraid daniel the first day that you "],["1035.52","set your heart to understand this and on "],["1037.839","humbling yourself before your god your "],["1040.24","words were heard and i've come to "],["1042.4","respond to your words so here comes the "],["1043.919","messenger an angel but he says the "],["1046.64","prince of the kingdom of persia was "],["1048.64","standing in my way for 21 days and "],["1050.96","behold michael that's another angel that "],["1054.16","we hear about specifically in scripture "],["1055.76","one of the chief priests one of the "],["1057.679","archangels came to help me for i had "],["1060.72","been there "],["1062","for with the kings of persia now i've "],["1063.919","come to explain to you what will happen "],["1065.6","to your people in the latter days so "],["1067.12","this angel could only be in one place "],["1068.72","and he was trapped in this spiritual "],["1070.48","battle with this this uh other spiritual "],["1073.919","entity this evil one over the the persia "],["1077.679","oh my goodness what do angels look like "],["1080","well because they're spirits they don't "],["1081.2","really technically have bodies however "],["1083.28","the bible presents uh some descriptions "],["1085.28","for us they have generally human form "],["1089.2","in luke chapter 24 while they were "],["1091.12","perplexed about this this is a the "],["1093.36","resurrection of jesus it says that some "],["1096.799","men suddenly stood near them in gleaming "],["1100.08","clothes these were the women that came "],["1102","to the tomb and they see these men in "],["1104","gleaming clothes and that's how they're "],["1105.919","described but we also see other parts "],["1108.16","that angels have wings the cherubim have "],["1111.039","wings we see in um "],["1114.16","first kings chapter six "],["1116.16","and in isaiah it says the the seraphim "],["1119.52","have six wings so the cherubs have two "],["1122.08","big wings that they touch and they "],["1123.6","spread and then in isaiah it says the "],["1126.32","seraphim "],["1127.6","of uh two they cover their face and two "],["1129.679","they cover their feet and two they fly "],["1132.24","and so that's what the scripture gives "],["1133.919","us sometimes is specific descriptions "],["1136.559","and names of different angels cherubs "],["1139.36","seraphim archangel that's mentioned "],["1141.76","twice in the new testament michael is "],["1143.76","the only angel called the archangel "],["1146.16","and then more times than not it's just "],["1147.919","used the general term angel "],["1150.88","referring to all these spirit beings "],["1152.32","they're all different categories of what "],["1154.4","we call angels "],["1156.32","and they do interact with the real "],["1157.76","physical world the physical world that "],["1159.679","we live in the other world's real too "],["1161.28","which is we don't see it but "],["1163.52","for example when peter was in prison an "],["1165.28","angel showed up and it opened the door "],["1168.16","and brought him out in acts chapter 5. "],["1171.12","so sometimes you can see them but "],["1173.2","only if the lord allows it more times "],["1175.2","than not they can't be seen "],["1177.039","if you look at second kings chapter six "],["1179.76","that's a wild story more with elisha uh "],["1183.36","you remember this story second kings "],["1184.72","chapter six it's the story of um "],["1188.96","so the "],["1191.28","kingdom of assyria "],["1192.799","is out to get israel and uh so what "],["1196","happens is is every time they plan to do "],["1198.32","something and they got their troops all "],["1199.76","set "],["1200.72","elisha warns the king of israel and then "],["1203.36","they dodge it and they keep sneaking "],["1205.12","around and they can't get them and the "],["1207.12","uh the king of assyria is so angry about "],["1210.159","this he thinks somebody's spying and he "],["1212.48","says who here keeps telling israel our "],["1215.52","plans and then uh they say to him um "],["1220.72","if this is a chapter 6 verse number 11 "],["1223.2","will you tell me which of us is with the "],["1225.12","king of israel and the servants say no "],["1227.12","my lord "],["1228.159","o king but elisha the prophet who is in "],["1231.44","israel tells the king of israel the "],["1233.44","words that you speak in your bedchamber "],["1235.76","he knows it "],["1237.12","so he said go and see where he is that i "],["1239.76","may send and take him and he was told "],["1242.4","that he's at dotham so "],["1244.88","all the assyrian horses and chariots and "],["1246.72","a great army were there and they came by "],["1248.4","night and they surrounded the city and "],["1251.36","when the attendant of the man of god "],["1254.48","had risen up early and gone out he sees "],["1256.32","the army and the horses and the chariots "],["1258.159","circling the city and he says oh master "],["1260.559","what shall we do and he said "],["1263.52","elisha says do not fear "],["1265.679","for "],["1266.48","those who are with us "],["1268.4","are more "],["1269.52","than those with them "],["1271.12","and the attendant's like what are you "],["1272.559","talking about we're surrounded and "],["1274.4","elisha prays and says oh lord open his "],["1277.039","eyes that he may see and the lord opened "],["1278.88","the servant's eyes and he saw behold the "],["1281.28","mountains "],["1282.799","was full of the horses and the chariots "],["1285.84","of fire all around elisha "],["1289.76","elisha could see them the attendant "],["1292.32","could not and that's why i use that "],["1294.96","illustration of like frequencies where "],["1296.88","the angels can be all around "],["1298.799","and you don't even know that they're "],["1300.72","here "],["1302.32","and scripture tells us they're very "],["1304","powerful "],["1305.039","that in uh "],["1306.88","isaiah and his second kings one angel "],["1309.679","wiped out 185 000 assyrian troops "],["1313.6","one "],["1314.559","by himself "],["1315.919","and then you think about in second kings "],["1318","how the "],["1318.88","the whole mountain was full of the "],["1320.559","chariots and what is the what is the "],["1322.88","name that we have up here that speaks of "],["1325.52","that "],["1327.36","yahweh saba oath the lord "],["1330.84","of armies "],["1333.12","that's what that means the lord of hosts "],["1335.36","the heavenly host "],["1337.12","the angels protect us like we saw in "],["1339.44","elisha story uh the psalmist says the "],["1341.919","angel lord encamps around those that "],["1345.039","fear him and delivers them that's where "],["1347.84","we get that idea of guardian angels it "],["1350.24","comes from a passage of scripture that "],["1352.24","they're around to those who fear and "],["1354.64","protect us the bible tells us that god's "],["1357.76","angels don't just do things for people "],["1360.32","but he'll they also fight "],["1362.799","satan's angels the demons michael will "],["1365.6","lead god's angels in the final battle "],["1367.6","against satan and his angels according "],["1369.919","to revelation chapter 12 there's a war "],["1372.08","in heaven and michael and his angels "],["1373.919","fought against the dragon which is satan "],["1376.08","and the dragon and his angels but they "],["1378.4","didn't prevail and they were tossed out "],["1380.64","of heaven they were you know kicked out "],["1384.24","demons are fallen angels and i i don't "],["1386.48","really want to spend too much time on "],["1387.6","demons but we just know that the third "],["1389.76","of the angels created "],["1392","uh followed lucifer followed satan in "],["1395.039","his rebellion against god "],["1396.72","we know that pride was found in lucifer "],["1399.2","he was the first and the greatest uh "],["1402","created being he was in fact an angel "],["1404.96","but he wanted to be like god he wasn't "],["1407.76","happy with god's plans for him he didn't "],["1410.32","want to serve he wanted to rule and i "],["1413.12","suspect that a third of them that "],["1414.72","followed him likewise "],["1417.039","like that idea they wanted things their "],["1419.28","way and they did not want to serve but "],["1421.919","god has an order and plans for all that "],["1425.679","he creates and the word angel in the "],["1428.32","greek means what "],["1431.36","messenger right and it's the same uh the "],["1433.679","greek word is angelos and in in in "],["1436.159","hebrew it's "],["1438.799","with a hard guttural "],["1440.559","which are always fun to do "],["1442.4","so in the old testament both of those "],["1444.72","words mean messenger the bible uses the "],["1448","word angel when it refers to satan's "],["1450.799","messengers or demons like we saw in "],["1453.039","revelation chapter 12. so "],["1455.12","satan's angels are also messengers and "],["1458.08","likewise can give you "],["1460.159","messages "],["1461.76","they can give you information but the "],["1464.08","difference is the demons and satan's "],["1466.32","messages are always laced with deception "],["1469.84","they are half-truths with the intent of "],["1472.72","leading someone to destruction which is "],["1475.12","why paul gave us clear warning that "],["1477.279","whether in some people take this as "],["1479.44","hyperbole but no i would take this "],["1481.279","literally if "],["1482.72","we "],["1483.44","or an angel from heaven should preach "],["1485.44","the gospel contrary to what we preached "],["1487.36","let him be accursed is what paul said "],["1490.72","more on that in a moment "],["1492.48","angels are created to serve

"],["1529.44","and other things about angels is they do "],["1531.279","express joy particularly when "],["1533.52","sinners "],["1534.64","repent "],["1535.76","luke tells us jesus said the angels "],["1538","rejoice in heaven over a sinner that "],["1540.32","repents and also they rejoiced and they "],["1542.72","celebrated at the dawn of creation when "],["1545.52","god created the earth they were there "],["1547.2","they were already created and they "],["1548.48","witnessed it "],["1550","we also know that angels carry out the "],["1551.52","judgments of god in revelation uh "],["1554.32","there's a great voice of the temple "],["1555.679","saying to the seven angels go your way "],["1557.36","and pour out the vials of the wrath of "],["1559.6","god upon the earth

"],["2017.039","could that be the coming great deception "],["2021.679","so here's the point the author of "],["2022.72","hebrews is making "],["2024.64","we know "],["2025.919","all about the spirit

is greater "],["2039.36","than angels "],["2041.039","he has a more excellent name and what is "],["2043.679","his name verse number five "],["2045.6","which of the angels did he ever say "],["2047.76","you are my son "],["2049.679","this day i've begotten you and then he "],["2052","just keeps quoting all these old "],["2053.76","testament "],["2054.8","passages and saying that's about jesus "],["2058.24","sit at the right hand till i make the "],["2059.919","enemies your footstool you laid the "],["2062.159","foundation look at that one verse number "],["2063.839","10 you

"],["2074.48","the right hand of god that's all about "],["2076.48","jesus "],["2078.72","so i've illustrated to you that the jews "],["2080.32","and the hebrews believed in the spirit "],["2081.839","world they had lots of teachings and "],["2084.079","theories about angels you remember when "],["2085.839","we were studying the book of luke how "],["2087.119","there was a lot of demon possession that "],["2088.639","was really rampant at that time this was "],["2090.96","due to the fact that the people had "],["2092.32","opened their lives up to these "],["2094.079","influences "],["2095.359","of these beings chasing after them for "],["2097.68","blessings and hidden knowledge and "],["2099.92","that's a temptation that still goes on "],["2101.76","today horoscopes and palm reading and "],["2104.24","fortune telling that's all dabbling in "],["2106.56","the spirit world but anything those "],["2109.2","spirits can offer you by way of helper "],["2111.44","insights is going to be inferior to what "],["2114.88","jesus the son of god "],["2116.48","is offering you today he sits at the "],["2119.44","right hand of god he rules from the "],["2121.76","throne of god he has a more excellent "],["2124.24","name than they so angels are "],["2126","supernatural and they're real but we "],["2128.96","need to keep in mind "],["2130.4","that whatever an angel may do for us "],["2132.88","they do it only when they're following "],["2134.96","the commands of god and we shouldn't ask "],["2137.2","anything of angels directly we shouldn't "],["2138.8","pray to angels and uh we are not to "],["2141.76","worship them we really don't have the "],["2143.76","wisdom to interact with them "],["2146.8","so all of our
