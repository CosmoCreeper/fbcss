loving faithful "],["380.849","and apt to persevere and I personally "],["386.009","think that this is an accurate "],["387.33","description of one of the key players in "],["389.49","our Christmas story we see love faith "],["394.199","and perseverance in the actions of mr. "],["397.38","Joseph and you thought I had to break "],["399.96","from Titus to do a Christmas story no "],["402.36","it's in there this morning we're going "],["404.669","to look at Joseph's initial response to "],["407.639","finding out his fiance was pregnant with "],["410.13","the child that wasn't his and we're "],["411.96","going to see the law of the faith and "],["414.33","the perseverance in this man Matthew "],["416.069","chapter 1 turn to Matthew chapter 1 and "],["419.27","we pick up the story in verse number 18 "],["424.009","and it says now Matthew 118 the birth of "],["429.57","Jesus Christ was as follows when his "],["432.18","mother Mary being betrothed to Joseph "],["434.58","before they came together was found to "],["436.8","be with child by the Holy Spirit and "],["439.88","Joseph her husband being a righteous man "],["442.71","was not wanting to disgrace her plan to "],["445.889","send her away secretly but when he "],["448.38","considered this behold an angel of the "],["451.77","Lord appeared to him in a dream saying "],["453.599","Joseph son of David do not be afraid to "],["456.78","take Mary as your wife for the child who "],["459.15","has been conceived in her is of the Holy "],["461.219","Spirit she will bear a son and you shall "],["463.59","call his name Jesus he will save his "],["466.259","people from their sins now all this took "],["469.02","place to fulfill what was spoken by the "],["471.509","Lord through the Prophet behold a virgin "],["473.55","shall be with child and shall bear a son "],["476.009","and you shall call his name Immanuel "],["478.77","which translated means God with us and "],["482.01","Joseph awoke from his sleep and did is "],["483.99","the angel of the lord commanded him and "],["485.55","took Mary as his wife but "],["487.32","kept her as a virgin until she gave "],["489.81","birth to a son and called his name Jesus "],["494.18","it says in verse number 19 he's a "],["496.35","righteous man meaning he's going to "],["498.51","follow the law now that Mary is having "],["501.75","somebody else's child it's obvious that "],["504.09","she hasn't kept the law she hasn't kept "],["507.27","her end of the deal to this marriage "],["509.49","contract Joseph is going to follow the "],["512.7","law and he is going to release her from "],["516.479","the marriage contract but he's going to "],["518.91","do it in such a way that he's going to "],["520.86","save her a great deal of disgrace when "],["524.58","it says not wanting to disgrace her it "],["526.74","means he wasn't going to take the broken "],["529.92","marriage contract public it means that "],["534.09","he wasn't going to follow the full "],["535.68","extent of the law which it would have "],["538.71","said that in Deuteronomy chapter 22 if a "],["542.01","girl who was a virgin engaged to a man "],["543.63","and another man finds her in the city "],["545.49","and lives with her then you shall bring "],["547.14","them both out to the gate of that city "],["548.58","and stone them to death the girl cuz she "],["551.1","didn't cry out in the city and the man "],["552.54","because he was violated his neighbor's "],["554.85","wife thus you shall purge the evil from "],["557.19","among you pretty severe isn't it I think "],["562.59","what Joseph actions show us is that even "],["565.74","though the law often prescribed stoning "],["568.35","in the Old Testament generally speaking "],["570.09","the people did in practice that "],["573.83","punishments there were ways to avoid "],["576.51","killing all these neighbors and friends "],["579.42","and loved ones the animal sacrifices at "],["582.54","the temple were enough blood to be shed "],["585.3","for many of these situations furthermore "],["588.44","even when you think about some other "],["590.67","other events and other narrative "],["593.28","passages when the high priest who has "],["596.01","the most powerful position in the nation "],["597.78","he wanted to kill Jesus but he didn't "],["601.08","have the authority to simply order it "],["603.48","done you remember in the Christmas "],["605.64","Easter story he had to take it to the "],["607.95","governor of the whole region the Roman "],["610.11","governor Pontius Pilate to sign off on "],["611.7","it so these people were under Roman law "],["614.04","and the people of Israel in the New "],["615.69","Testament couldn't just execute anyone "],["618.3","they wanted to the reason why I point "],["620.64","all that "],["621.209","is because many times you are going to "],["623.04","hear people spouting off old testament "],["625.379","laws as a way to illustrate how horrible "],["627.66","and petty God is he's demanding all of "],["630.749","these executions but again the purpose "],["633.48","of the law the points the context that "],["636.66","you need to read the scripture in the "],["638.279","purpose of the law was to illustrate the "],["640.35","fact that mankind was indeed worthy of "],["644.759","death and desperate need of a savior the "],["648.509","animal sacrifices the lamb sacrifices "],["650.759","were the substitute the temporary "],["652.589","sacrifices that illustrated the fact "],["654.569","that Holy Justice called for righteous "],["657.42","vengeance it is a fact that the wages of "],["660.48","sin is death and all of mankind does "],["665.49","indeed die whether it's by stoning the "],["668.579","moment you sin or by old age the result "],["671.49","is still the same sin is the death of us "],["675.269","all Joseph doesn't want to destroy Mary "],["679.23","he he wants to handle it quietly that's "],["682.98","a very kind thing to do don't you think "],["684.899","to not put her to public shame Christian "],["688.529","love is kindness Christian love is being "],["691.259","merciful first Peter chapter 4 verse "],["693.929","number 8 tells us above all keep fervent "],["697.319","in your love for one another because "],["699.42","love covers a multitude of sin and that "],["704.069","is exactly what Joseph is doing he is "],["706.589","covering he's the one who's been wronged "],["708.929","not the entire community it's not a "],["711.629","public problem it's a personal offense "],["714.119","therefore he's going to deal with it "],["715.799","personally you know when you see a "],["719.819","marriage that you think is a really good "],["722.189","marriage it's not that those two "],["724.559","individuals are perfect it's that they "],["727.769","love each other in a manner where the "],["730.41","love "],["738.57","you "],["740.29","to perform so far in 2016 lots of "],["744.009","newlyweds around here I need to talk to "],["746.079","about these things right but that's how "],["748.69","a good marriage lasts long you know that "],["753.07","she's not perfect she knows that you're "],["756.73","not perfect should tell you from time to "],["760.24","time but your love for each other you "],["764.68","love each other despite the flaws "],["767.92","despite the failures despite the sin if "],["771.759","you're waiting to love someone who's "],["773.98","never sinned then you're only ever going "],["776.23","to be able to love Jesus right because "],["778.06","that's the only person who's never "],["779.29","sinned but Jesus tells us to love wanna "],["782.05","nother right so we're supposed to "],["785.92","practice that you know I my "],["787.66","mother-in-law's favorite did you know "],["790.209","that you know don't tell the other "],["792.16","in-laws but I know I'm her favorite she "],["795.91","thinks I'm just a wonderful guy who's an "],["798.97","amazing spouse to her daughter doesn't "],["801.699","do anything wrong you wonder why that is "],["804.569","because in all the years of marriage "],["807.459","we've had my wife has never told her of "],["810.16","anything I've done wrong she's never "],["812.05","told her any of the stupid annoying "],["813.91","hurtful insensitive things that I do do "],["816.25","you suppose it as I never do anything "],["818.139","like that yeah or maybe I do a lot of "],["824.26","stuff but she loves me anyways you know "],["828.399","how there's this stereotype about older "],["831.519","people that the older they get the "],["832.839","cranky are more critical they become i "],["834.73","mean i'm not talking about faith bible "],["836.68","church older people that doesn't it "],["838.089","doesn't apply to our crowd but you know "],["839.23","i'm saying in general there's kind of "],["840.49","that stereotype people get older and "],["842.23","crankier Paul says older men should be "],["845.649","sound in love meaning that they're not "],["849.31","getting crankier and more critical on "],["852.699","the contrary they're going to be loving "],["855.31","and more loving and continue to be sound "],["859.18","in loved you a lot of the folks here "],["862","remember brother Bill Mitchell and he "],["865.3","passed away in 2011 is it doesn't even "],["867.939","seem like it's been that long does it "],["869.26","and what what a warm friendly demeanor "],["873.31","that may "],["874.03","man had his kindness was so evident some "],["877.84","of those old guys have passed on now "],["879.4","brother Barclay hailstone brother jim "],["882.43","townsend these guys were gentlemen they "],["884.83","were so positive and so encouraging and "],["887.02","they never complained about anyone or "],["888.88","anything they just had these big "],["891.01","grateful hearts they were sound in love "],["896.91","we need to be sound in love we need to "],["900.04","be sound in faith Joseph was sound in "],["904.51","faith looking again at Matthew chapter 1 "],["907.57","verse number 20 how the angel appeared "],["910.72","to him in a dream saying Joseph son of "],["913.03","David don't be afraid to take Mary as "],["914.71","your wife for the child who has been "],["916.06","conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit "],["917.82","she will bear a son and you will call "],["920.38","his name Jesus for he will save his "],["922.51","people from their sins now all this took "],["925.03","place to fulfill what was spoken by the "],["926.83","Lord through the Prophet behold the "],["928.99","Virgin shall be with child and show "],["930.99","verisign and call his name immanuel neta "],["935.23","says in verse 24 Joseph awoke from his "],["937.21","sleep did what the angel LORD commanded "],["939.22","him and took Mary as his wife so once he "],["942.94","gets the word from the angel he then is "],["946.03","faithful to obey it and that is the end "],["948.82","of the discussion that is the end of the "],["951.7","debate what should I do with Mary oh you "],["954.22","should take her as your wife and story "],["957.43","and then he steps out in faith and he "],["959.5","obeys the word of the Lord uh yeah but "],["962.17","pastor wrong he he had an angel of the "],["964.78","Lord appeared to him and tell him "],["966.25","directly what to do and that's really "],["968.2","incredible if anyone got a direct visit "],["970.87","from an angel then they would do exactly "],["972.16","the same thing well ok first of all it "],["975.82","was all in a dream it tells us and has "],["979.27","anybody had a real vivid dream then woke "],["980.86","up and said ok that was just a dream "],["982.21","right so we you know he could have "],["984.16","reason the way that it wasn't real but "],["986.62","because he is a man of faith and because "],["989.38","he believed in God and believed in the "],["991.63","concept of the Messiah he took it "],["994.03","literally the whole concept of the "],["996.79","version conceiving in the Messiah coming "],["998.65","that wasn't unheard of that wasn't a "],["1000.81","foreign concept that was scripture that "],["1003.24","was prophecy Isaiah chapter 7 verte for "],["1006.63","ya some verse 4 "],["1007.59","team therefore the Lord Himself will "],["1009.57","give you a sign it will give you a "],["1012.47","miracle that a Virgin will be with child "],["1015.66","and bear a son and call his name "],["1017.96","immanuel sometimes people will assume "],["1020.61","Mary's story would have been "],["1022.35","unbelievable to Joseph people would have "],["1025.65","taken Mary's story it's just a wild "],["1027.87","excuse for Mary being unfaithful to "],["1030","Joseph you're having the Messiah and "],["1031.95","you're a virgin right yeah I don't think "],["1035.37","so no that isn't what happened though "],["1037.77","matter of fact for people who take the "],["1040.2","prophecies literally it would have been "],["1042.54","taken exactly how it should have been "],["1045.6","taken as a miraculous fulfillment to a "],["1048.33","seven hundred year old prophecy a person "],["1052.23","of faith would know the word and would "],["1055.52","believe the word that's what a person of "],["1058.65","faith would do so when the angel in the "],["1061.23","dream a firm's Mary's story that it is "],["1065.04","in fact a fulfillment of prophecy "],["1066.81","Joseph's sound faith propels him to be "],["1071.4","obedient scripture tells us that we are "],["1073.71","to test the spirits and see if they are "],["1075.78","from God and the angel of the Lord's "],["1077.88","message is in fact supported by the Word "],["1081.3","of God do we do not need supernatural "],["1086.1","experiences to promote faith in us to "],["1089.73","produce faith in us because the Word of "],["1092.16","God is enough and we have the same signs "],["1095.94","we have the same miracles the same sign "],["1098.79","that Joseph head we have today a seven "],["1101.73","hundred year old fulfillment of prophecy "],["1104.43","and if people are unwilling to see that "],["1106.38","as a miracle then what other miracle "],["1108.42","would suffice faith comes by hearing and "],["1111.6","hearing by the Word of God you need to "],["1115.92","hear the word and believe what it says "],["1118.32","and do it and then brothers and sisters "],["1121.62","then you will see all kinds of miracles "],["1125.72","remember when Jesus came and did "],["1127.89","miracles he made the blind see it he "],["1129.54","made the lame walk and he raised people "],["1131.46","from the dead brought folks back to life "],["1133.98","and did that that did nothing to inspire "],["1137.25","faith in the faithless religious leaders "],["1139.95","of his time "],["1141.21","they were so they had so corrupted the "],["1143.94","Word of God they had rejected the "],["1145.83","literal teaching so much that they "],["1147.48","wouldn't even believe in God when God "],["1149.25","Himself was in front of them doing godly "],["1151.62","things before their very eyes but people "],["1154.409","who believe what this says well we see

"],["1382.59","rapture hadn't happened there you go "],["1385.76","detailed answer for a detailed question "],["1388.77","now question why does God want to move "],["1393.36","the restrainer now it is illustration "],["1397.65","time I'm looking for my friend Corey "],["1399.99","Corey needs to come up here to help me "],["1401.55","up okay so when you play basketball yes "],["1407.94","we have to talk about the sports because "],["1409.35","ultimately all comes down sport when you "],["1411.45","play basketball the concept of "],["1413.79","basketball is to put the ball in the net "],["1415.74","okay and the concept for the other team "],["1418.14","defending is to stop them from putting "],["1420.27","the ball in that now if the net was "],["1422.28","right here which would be higher than "],["1424.5","this the most easiest place to score a "],["1426.84","basket is really close right and being a "],["1432.09","closest and being able to bank the ball "],["1434.19","in off the backboard is the easiest best "],["1436.71","way to score a bucket so what happens is "],["1439.98","the big tall basketball players try to "],["1442.92","get as close as they can and ask for the "],["1447.03","ball right so if Corey gets the ball "],["1449.31","here and turns around I'm not going to "],["1452.88","stop him because I'm little okay and "],["1455.46","he's bigger than me so now as a little "],["1459.39","guy plays basketball and a person who "],["1460.83","coaches what I try to teach my players "],["1463.44","and what I try to practice is just don't "],["1466.41","let Corey have this spot just stand in "],["1469.86","that spot ok so then what happens in the "],["1472.92","game of basketball wreaking you "],["1476.05","what happens in the game of basketball "],["1478.06","is you have typically the big guys fight "],["1480.91","over that spot Corey wants that spot and "],["1483.28","I want to get him out of that spot and "],["1485.2","then we start this game of pushing and "],["1487.57","shoving which I wouldn't bring Tim "],["1488.71","talked her up here because he's too good "],["1490.09","at this and he plows me out of the way "],["1491.86","so we teach a little bit of techniques "],["1493.99","we say ok when the big guys in there and "],["1495.79","he wants the ball you get you can't push "],["1497.62","with your upper body but you can push "],["1499.57","with your legs in your lower body you "],["1501.37","dislodge him and you resist him and "],["1504.19","restrain him from getting in here ok and "],["1507.43","so this is what it is and then Corey "],["1509.92","who's bigger than me says I'm look at "],["1511.03","this little fat guy pushed me around and "],["1512.83","he starts pushing back see how Corey's "],["1514.72","now pushing back and what happens is "],["1516.88","when he's pushing hard and I'm pushing "],["1518.86","hard as I'm pushing and aggravating him "],["1520.81","he starts pushing back what happens is I "],["1523.75","do this move called pulling the chair "],["1525.88","and pulling the chair is as he I can "],["1528.7","feel him making a big lunge I release "],["1530.83","the restraint swim around and take the "],["1533.77","spot and Corey ends up out of position "],["1537.07","and many times on the ground because "],["1540.49","he's over played himself and he's got "],["1542.95","nothing restraining him so he falls out "],["1545.98","of position or on the ground Thank You "],["1547.33","Corey well said the question was why is "],["1553.21","the restraint removed do you see where "],["1555.16","I'm going with this brothers and sisters "],["1557.92","the enemy is pushing pushing pushing "],["1561.46","hard on us pushing the unrighteousness "],["1564.82","the lawlessness the

"],["201.7","so did I and Robbie ended up winning "],["204.25","that game now sometimes when I play risk "],["206.62","I played a riff to win other times if I "],["209.47","know I'm not going to win I

"],["1525.78","over right so that could happen they "],["1527.19","wouldn't know but what has happened "],["1529.44","since the writing of the letter second "],["1530.76","Thessalonians is the Temple

"],["1584.94","what if that is what officially "],["1588.96","establishes the seven-year covenant with "],["1590.76","Israel that brings peace in the Middle "],["1591.99","East think about that for a

"],["879.059","do I make that interpretation because "],["882.059","the lamb is always affiliated with for "],["887.999","Jesus right Jesus is the Lamb of God "],["890.04","which takes away the sins

"],["1175.61","can't do it all but let me tell you a "],["1177.8","summary of what happens in Revelation "],["1180.64","people will follow Jesus and die for "],["1186.38","people will follow the

what happens to "],["1218.37","you just go to eternal damnation with "],["1221.7","him and suffer in the lake of fire "],["1222.96","that's a revelation said so yeah there's "],["1224.73","quite a bit

not over "],["815.59","emphasizing one doctrine is i follow "],["817.78","this preaching strategy called "],["820.26","expository preaching right where i just "],["822.94","take a book stay in it and

"],["860.05","know affects what you do so if you know "],["861.91","the Word of God it will affect you in a "],["863.53","positive manner but if you have been "],["866.59","given bad teaching or false teaching "],["868.54","that will affect you too and the "],["871.15","Thessalonians were be affected by some "],["872.86","bad teaching false doctrine they they "],["876.01","were told they missed the

"],["892.56","I'm not sure how they figured they "],["894.579","missed the coming of Jesus but their "],["896.68","persecutions and their afflictions were "],["898.36","so bad in so intense they assumed this "],["900.939","has got to be the Great Tribulation this "],["903.339","has got to be the end because there's no "],["904.839","way on earth it can get any worse than "],["906.61","this
