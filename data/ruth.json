(Pastor Rob McNutt)","date":"2025-05-11","transcript":[["22","20 years"],["23.64","ago, I could not provide for my wife and"],["29.359","mother of my three children. I was"],["32.079","living with my in-laws."],["36.16","Summer of 2005, I had finished my first"],["39.44","year of seminary. I couldn't go back to"],["41.68","Canada since there was no job there for"],["43.52","me in the summer. I couldn't get a"],["44.96","full-time job in the States or afford"],["47.12","any housing here. My in-laws graciously"],["50.239","offered to house us while I was"],["52.239","studying. So, I had to be content being"],["55.6","a foreigner on a student visa, making do"],["58.8","with the odd jobs friends from church"],["61.44","offered me. So, I found some jobs that"],["64.32","paid cash, working for a moving company"],["67.76","and doing some"],["69.24","construction. 10 years earlier, when I"],["71.439","married, I had a job. I could provide"],["73.84","for my family, but I decided to give all"],["75.84","that up, leave Canada, and go back to"],["77.759","school. For all of my childhood, school"],["80.96","felt like an affliction. Can I get an"],["83.68","amen from anybody? School, right? Even"],["86.96","after I graduated college like Garrett"],["89.28","did, I was just like, \"Woo! Glad that's"],["93.119","over. I don't ever want to go back to"],["95.6","school.\" But 10 years later, I was back"],["97.28","in school feeling very poor and"],["100","afflicted working on moving trucks in"],["102.96","the summer here in the DMV and that 100"],["105.439","90 degree like wet blanket wrapped"],["108.64","around you humidity felt like an"],["110.96","affliction."],["112.64","There are times when we all feel like we"],["115.92","are suffering some level of affliction."],["117.6","Whether that's some educational pain or"],["119.68","some financial pain or maybe broken"],["122.56","relationships with family and with"],["124.68","friends, sickness. We've had requests"],["127.92","for people dealing with sickness."],["130","Sometimes even when we're trying to"],["132.319","serve the"],["134.12","Lord, we are in the middle of a crisis"],["136.64","in ministry. For me, it was ministry"],["138.959","related crisis in 2004 that pushed me to"],["142.64","resign from my church in Canada and come"],["145.28","back to seminary which resulted in the"],["147.76","financial affliction that I was feeling"],["150.239","in 2005. One affliction just led to"],["153.44","another affliction. I was trying to"],["155.04","serve God. Why was my life so hard?"],["158.08","Well, many people here today, you're"],["160.239","feeling afflicted and you're wondering"],["162.16","why God, why are you allowing this"],["166","affliction?"],["167.519","Today, as Pastor Mark said, we begin a"],["169.92","new series in the book of Ruth. I invite"],["172.48","you to take your copy of the word of God"],["174.16","and turn to Ruth chapter 1. Let's read"],["177.28","the whole chapter and then we will make"],["179.92","some observations, interpretations, and"],["182.2","applications for ourselves today. Ruth"],["185.28","chapter 1 verse one. Now it came to pass"],["187.28","in the days when the judges ruled, there"],["189.2","was a famine in the land. A certain man"],["191.84","of Bethlehem Judah went to dwell in the"],["194.239","country of Moab. He and his wife and his"],["196.48","two sons. The name of the man was IMC."],["199.2","The name of the wife, his wife, was"],["200.8","Naomi. And the name of the two sons,"],["202.959","Malon and Chilon, Ephraimites of"],["205.76","Bethlehem of Judah, and they went to the"],["208.239","country of Moab, and remained there."],["210.72","Then Almc Naomi's husband, died. She was"],["213.84","left with her two sons. Now they took"],["216.159","wives of the women of Moab and the name"],["218.48","of one was"],["220.04","Oprah and the other was Ruth and they"],["224.319","dwelt there 10 years and then both Malon"],["227.12","and Chilion also died. So the woman"],["229.68","survived her two sons and her husband."],["233.28","Then she arose with her daughter-in-laws"],["235.519","and that she might return from the"],["237.2","country of Moab. For she had heard in"],["239.92","the country of Moab that the Lord had"],["241.599","visited his people and given them bread."],["243.2","Therefore, she went out from the place"],["245.2","where she was, and her two"],["246.879","daughter-in-laws with her, and they went"],["248.56","on their way to return to the land of"],["250.439","Judah. Naomi said to her two"],["252.56","daughter-in-laws, \"Go return each to her"],["256.56","mother's house. The Lord deal kindly"],["259.199","with you as you have dealt with the dead"],["261.6","and with me. The Lord grant that you"],["263.759","will find rest each in the house of her"],["266.08","husband.\" So he she kissed them and they"],["269.759","lifted up their voices and wept. And"],["271.84","they said to her, \"Surely we'll return"],["273.84","with you to your people.\" But Naomi"],["276.16","said, \"Turn back, my daughters. Why will"],["279.44","you go with me? Are there still sons in"],["282","my womb that they may bring you"],["284.639","husbands?\" \"Turn back, my daughters. Go,"],["287.28","for I am too old to have a husband. If I"],["290.08","should say I have hope, if I should have"],["292.4","a husband tonight and should also bear"],["294.479","sons, would you wait for them till they"],["296.56","are grown? Would you restrain yourselves"],["298.88","from having husbands? No, my daughters,"],["301.6","for it grieves me very much for your"],["303.759","sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone"],["306.56","out against"],["307.96","me. Then they lifted up their voices and"],["310.4","they wept again. And Oprah"],["313.24","kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung"],["316.56","to her. And she said, \"Look, your"],["319.919","sister-in-law is gone back to her people"],["322.08","and to her gods. Return after your"],["324.16","sister-in-law.\" But Ruth said, \"Entreat"],["326.56","me not to leave you or to turn back from"],["330.08","following after you. For wherever you"],["332.88","go, I will go, and wherever you lodge, I"],["336.08","will lodge. Your people shall be my"],["338.639","people and your God my God. When you"],["341.84","die, I die. And there I will be me be"],["345.199","there I will be buried.\" the Lord do so"],["348.639","to me and more also if anything but"],["352","death parts you and"],["354.28","me. When she saw that she had determined"],["356.96","to go with her, she stopped speaking to"],["358.88","her. Now the two of them went until they"],["361.68","came to Bethlehem and it happened when"],["364.4","they had come to Bethlehem and all the"],["367.36","city was excited because of them. And"],["369.12","the woman said, \"Is this not Naomi?\" But"],["371.52","she said to them, \"Don't call me Naomi."],["373.6","Call me Mara. For the Almighty has dealt"],["376.88","very bitterly with me. I went out full"],["380.08","and the Lord has brought me home again"],["381.68","empty. Why do you call me Naomi since"],["383.84","the Lord has testified against me and"],["385.919","the Almighty has afflicted me? So Naomi"],["390.24","returned and Ruth the Moabitis her"],["392.16","daughter-in-law with her who returned to"],["394.8","the country of Moab returned from the"],["397.6","country of Moab. Now, they came to"],["400.08","Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley"],["404.36","harvest. Chapter 1, it starts out with"],["407.84","Naomi feeling like the hand of the"],["410","Almighty has been against her, that she"],["412.08","has been afflicted by God. She says in"],["414.72","verse 21, \"Don't call me Naomi, call me"],["419.28","Mara,\" which means bitter, \"ince the"],["421.44","Lord has testified against me and the"],["423.199","Almighty has afflicted me.\""],["427.28","She feels this way"],["429.24","because she was being afflicted by God."],["434","And it will do us no good for me to deny"],["437.72","that. Many preachers do not want you to"],["441.12","have any negative emotions about the"],["444.24","topic of God or church. Many people"],["447.919","think that all your experiences here in"],["450.08","church, they they need to be warm and"],["452.639","and pleasant so that you'll feel safe"],["456.16","around"],["457.56","God. I have"],["460.12","not,"],["461.72","cannot, will not offer you a safe God. I"],["466.72","can show you a powerful God who has a"],["469.759","great plan to save you and bless you."],["472.479","But the way he leads all of us is not"],["475.599","around affliction, but through it. Ruth"],["479.919","is a beautiful story. It is a prequel to"],["483.36","God's great plan for the redemption and"],["485.84","the glorification of humanity. It does"],["488.56","have a happy ending, but it starts with"],["490.879","the cold, hard truth that Naomi needs to"],["494.479","be saved from something. We cannot"],["497.28","ignore the state of debt, poverty,"],["499.84","sickness, and desperation that all of"],["502.56","humanity needs to be redeemed from. The"],["506.72","pain, the affliction is making everyone"],["509.84","aware of the problem. When you break a"],["512.88","bone, you feel pain, right? The pain"],["516.479","tells you, \"Hey, something's wrong."],["518.159","Something's broke here.\" Without it,"],["519.68","you'd be unaware of your broken state."],["521.519","The pain is not the problem. The problem"],["523.599","is the is the broken bone. But the pain"],["526.72","makes you stop what you're doing and"],["528.72","attend to the problem. So Naomi is"],["530.959","feeling the pain affliction from God."],["533.68","Let's see if we can find what the root"],["535.36","of the problem is. Actually, it's not"],["537.519","very hard to figure out. It's right"],["538.959","there in the opening statement. Did you"],["540.399","catch it? Ruth chapter 1 verse number"],["543.12","one. It tells you right up front, in the"],["546.399","days when the judges ruled, there was a"],["549.839","famine in the"],["551.56","land. See? Makes sense, right? This is"],["556","not a random tale. This is not a"],["558.16","historic w with no historical or"],["560","theological"],["561.32","context. There is all that is being"],["563.68","communicated in that opening statement."],["565.519","You just got to know what was going on"],["567.12","before you get to Ruth. So, let me catch"],["569.6","us up. Let me give us the context."],["572.08","Little history lesson. I'll tell you"],["574.399","what this means. The days of the judges,"],["577.44","when was that? What was going on? So"],["579.519","around 2000 BC, God called Abraham and"],["584.08","he said, \"Leave your father's land."],["586.72","Follow me to a land that I will give"],["588.8","your descendants as an inheritance. And"],["590.64","I will make of you a great nation, and I"],["592.56","will bless you, and I will bless those"],["594.56","that bless you, and I will curse those"],["596.24","that curse you, and through your seed,"],["598.24","through your family line, all the"],["600.56","nations of the world will be blessed.\""],["602.399","Abraham by faith believed God, and he"],["605.6","obeyed. God made an unconditional"],["608","covenant with Abraham. God was going to"],["610.16","fulfill these promises. God was going to"],["612.24","keep his word. So Abraham had a son,"],["614.64","Isaac, and that covenant was passed on"],["616.72","to Isaac. And Isaac had a son, Jacob,"],["619.44","and that covenant was passed to Jacob."],["621.76","Jacob's name was changed to Israel. And"],["625.279","Israel had 12 sons. And the covenant was"],["629.44","passed to the 12 tribes of Israel. The"],["632.399","covenant of God went down to the"],["634","children of Israel there. That's the"],["635.36","whole book of Genesis. Just finish that."],["637.519","Just like that. At the conclusion of"],["640","Genesis, we see that Israel and his 12"],["642.72","sons, all their families moved to Egypt"],["646.48","where they were blessed for a time. They"],["648.64","grew into a nation, but then they were"],["651.88","enslaved and they were enslaved for 400"],["656.079","years. But the Lord sent Moses to lead"],["659.76","them out of slavery to the promised land"],["662.56","around 1500 BC. there. The book of"],["665.04","Exodus just took care of that. On the"],["667.44","way, Moses received the laws of God and"],["670.64","wrote them down."],["671.88","Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. God"],["675.76","said he's going to give the people the"],["677.68","land he's promised them that he promised"],["680.16","to Abraham, and he will greatly bless"],["682.16","them and prosper them if they obey the"],["685.279","laws and don't worship any other gods."],["687.44","However, if they do not obey the laws of"],["689.839","God and they worship other gods, he"],["692.32","would curse them. And this is called a"],["695.519","conditional covenant. Slightly different"],["697.36","from the unconditional covenant that God"],["699.36","made with Abraham. Those promises do not"],["701.519","change. The conditional covenant is obey"],["703.76","the laws and be blessed. Disobey the"],["706","laws and be cursed. And this was to"],["709.2","teach the people about justice,"],["712.2","righteousness, sacrifice, and"],["715.04","redemption."],["716.72","The laws were so very hard for the"],["718.48","people to keep. People sinned and they"],["720.48","fell short of living right. However, God"],["723.04","had instituted the animal sacrificial"],["726.079","system to atone for their sins. So, as"],["729.12","long as the nation followed the laws and"],["731.6","practiced the sacrifices to atone for"],["733.76","sin, worshiped the God of Abraham only,"],["736.48","they were going to be blessed. After"],["739.44","Moses died, Joshua led the people in"],["742.24","conquest of the promised land. That's"],["744.48","now the book of Joshua. They divided the"],["746.8","land up. They won the land and they"],["748.32","divided it from between the 12 tribes"],["750.92","around 1400 BC through that time period."],["755.44","Near the end of his life, Joshua"],["757.2","implored the people, be faithful, serve"],["760","the Lord. And actually, Pastor Mark did"],["761.68","that song for us. As for me and my"],["764.32","house, we will serve. That was Joshua."],["767.2","Serve the Lord our God. The people"],["769.6","pledged that they would do it. and all"],["771.519","the elders of the tribe of Israel"],["773.2","fulfilled that pledge even after Joshua"],["775.68","died. The whole generation was faithful."],["778.16","But then we get to the book of Judges."],["781.12","Turn to Judges chapter"],["783.72","2. Oh, why did it take us a whole year"],["785.839","to do Revelation? Look, I've just done"],["787.92","six books of the Bible. It's like"],["790.44","that"],["791.959","ridiculous. Chapter 2, verse number"],["795.16","7. Judges 2:7. So the people served the"],["798.32","Lord all the days of Joshua, all the"],["800.48","days of the elders who outlived Joshua,"],["802.16","who had seen the great works of the"],["803.519","Lord, which he' done for Israel. Now"],["805.92","Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of"],["808","the Lord, died, and he was 110 years"],["810.16","old, and they buried him at the border"],["811.6","of his"],["812.519","inheritance, went verse number 10, when"],["815.12","all the generation had been gathered to"],["817.279","their fathers, what does that mean? What"],["818.8","does that idiom mean? They were gathered"],["820.32","to their fathers. Means that that whole"],["822.32","generation passed away. They died."],["825.279","Another generation arose after them who"],["828.24","did not know the Lord nor the works that"],["830.48","he had done for"],["833.88","Israel. So all the people, the children"],["836.48","who remember Joshua faithful, the next"],["838.399","generation, verse number 11, the"],["839.839","children of Israel did evil in the sight"],["841.519","of the Lord and served the baales. They"],["844.88","forsook the Lord God of their fathers"],["847.04","who had brought them into the out of the"],["848.56","land of Egypt, followed other gods from"],["850.32","among the gods of the people who were"],["851.68","around them. And they bowed down to them"],["853.68","and they provoked the Lord to anger."],["856.32","They forsook the Lord. They served the"],["857.92","bales and the asteros. And the anger of"],["860.639","the Lord was hot against Israel. So he"],["862.56","delivered them into the hands of"],["864.32","plunderers who desoiled them and he sold"],["866.72","them into the hands of the enemies all"],["868.16","around. So they could no longer stand"],["870.48","before their enemies. Wherever they went"],["873.199","out, the hand of the Lord was against"],["874.56","them for calamity. As the Lord said, and"],["876.48","as the Lord had sworn to them, they were"],["878.32","greatly distressed. Nevertheless, the"],["880.48","Lord raised up judges who delivered them"],["882.32","out of the hands of those who plundered"],["883.76","them. Yet they would not listen to their"],["885.519","judges, but they played the harlots with"],["887.44","the other gods, bowed down to them,"],["889.44","turned quickly from the way which their"],["890.959","fathers walked in, and obeying the"],["892.16","commandments of the Lord. They did not"],["894.079","do"],["895.079","so. So that right there is a summary of"],["897.44","what happens for the next 300"],["901","years. From the time of Joshua for about"],["904.32","300 years, the people rebel, worship"],["907.12","false gods. God withholds protection and"],["909.12","blessing off the nation. Famine strikes."],["912.16","Foreign invad nations invade because of"],["914.959","the affliction. The people repent and"],["918.24","they call out to the Lord for help. And"],["920","then God raises up a judge to deliver"],["922.24","the nation. And then the people"],["924.56","experience peace and blessing. But then"],["926.399","that generation passes away and the next"],["928.399","generation does the same thing, disobys"],["930.32","and repeats the cycle. So the story of"],["933.279","Ruth is in the time of the"],["936.44","judges. And since there is famine in the"],["939.44","land, this tells us that during the time"],["941.68","of Naomi and her husband IMC, the nation"],["944.399","is in a period of rebellion. How do I"],["948.32","know that? Deuteronomy 28, turn to"],["951.199","Deuteronomy 28, listed very clearly in"],["954.48","the laws of Moses. Deuteronomy 28:1. Now"],["958.24","it shall come to pass, if you diligently"],["960.8","obey the voice of the Lord your God, to"],["963.199","observe carefully all his commands,"],["964.88","which I command you today, that the Lord"],["966.88","your God will set you high above the"],["968.72","nations of the earth. And all these"],["970.24","blessings shall come to you, overtake"],["972.079","you, because you obey the voice of the"],["974","Lord your God. Blessed shall you be in"],["976.56","the city. Blessed shall you be in the"],["978.72","country. Blessed shall be the f fruit of"],["981.12","your body. What does that mean? The"],["982.399","fruit of your body."],["984.48","Your wombs will be open. You will have"],["985.839","children, right? Happy Mother's Day."],["988.24","They get the kids. Blessed shall you be"],["990.8","the produce of the ground in the"],["992.639","increase of your herds, the increase of"],["994","your cattle, the offspring of your"],["995.44","flocks. Verse 5. Bless shall be the"],["997.44","basket and your kneading bowl. Blessed"],["1000","you will be when you come in and blessed"],["1001.44","you will be when you go out. The Lord"],["1002.959","will cause your enemies to rise against"],["1004.48","you and to be defeated before your face."],["1006.399","They shall come out against you one way"],["1008.24","and flee before you seven ways. The Lord"],["1012.24","will command the blessing on you in your"],["1013.959","storehouses and all which you set your"],["1016.48","hands, he will bless you in the land"],["1018.959","which the Lord your God is giving"],["1021.16","you. Go down to verse"],["1023.4","15. But it shall come to pass if you do"],["1026.48","not obey the voice of the Lord your God"],["1028.72","to observe carefully all his commands"],["1030.799","and his statutes which I command to you"],["1032.559","today that all these curses will come"],["1034.959","upon you and overtake you. Here we go."],["1038","Cursed you'll be in the city and cursed"],["1039.439","you'll be in the country. Curse shall be"],["1040.799","your basket in your kneading bowl."],["1042.319","Cursed shall be the fruit of your body"],["1044.079","and the produce of the land and the"],["1045.76","increase of your cattle and offspring"],["1047.28","and your flocks. Curse shall you be when"],["1049.52","you go in and curse will be when you go"],["1051.6","out. The Lord will send his cursings,"],["1054.72","confusion and rebuke in all that you set"],["1057.52","your hand to do until you are destroyed"],["1060.24","until you perish quickly because the"],["1062.08","wickedness of your doings in which you"],["1063.76","have forsaken me. The Lord will make"],["1066.16","these plagues cling to you until he's"],["1069.52","consumed you from the land which you're"],["1071.6","going to"],["1072.36","possess. So we look at Ruth and there's"],["1075.28","a famine in the land. That's a curse on"],["1078","the produce. The famine is an affliction"],["1081.76","sent by God because his people were"],["1084.48","being unfaithful to his laws. Was Alimc"],["1088.48","himself worshiping false gods? I don't"],["1091.039","know. It doesn't say that in Ruth. Maybe"],["1093.2","he was. Maybe he wasn't.

Will we believe in God and follow"],["2196.56","him even if his way seems like it's"],["2199.2","going to destroy us, ruin us? Will we"],["2203.04","trust him and take a step of faith? Ruth"],["2204.96","was leaving the safety and the"],["2206.88","protection of her people and her nation"],["2209.599","to go with Naomi to a foreign land to an"],["2212.48","uncertain situation. It was only"],["2214.4","offering"],["2215.64","poverty. I can only speculate as to why,"],["2219.599","but it has something to do with what she"],["2222.16","believed about the Lord. Did you catch"],["2226.32","that? In verse number"],["2228.599","17, she in her pledge, she says, \"Your"],["2231.28","people, my people, your God, my God,"],["2234.079","where you die, I will die.

Look at"],["2248.359","it. What's the"],["2251.64","Lord? Somebody sees it, right? It's all"],["2255.2","capitalized. Every letter is"],["2256.8","capitalized. What does that tell"],["2258.92","you? That is the formal name. What?"],["2262.72","Yahweh. Yahweh. That is the name of the"],["2265.839","God of"],["2267.079","Israel. Naomi said, \"Go back to your"],["2269.599","gods.

She wasn't trusting in the"],["2280.72","gods of Canaanite. She was turning to"],["2283.28","Yahweh. And that ought not be overlooked"],["2285.839","because this story is not about learning"],["2288.32","how to have love and loyalty like Ruth."],["2292.4","It's not about being good and good"],["2294.8","things will come to you.

It's not be good to your"],["2346.2","mother-in-law even though that would be"],["2348.52","nice and she would think that was"],["2351.8","lovely.

Because"],["2364.96","that's not what Ruth is about. It's"],["2367.28","about a step of faith honoring the Lord,"],["2369.92","not moms.

And then Naomi does a very wise"],["2383.2","thing. She realizes that this was not"],["2386.32","about what she thought was best for"],["2389.56","Ruth. She had already given her wisdom"],["2391.839","and shared her opinion. You know, go"],["2393.599","with your sister. Go back to your family"],["2395.52","and your gods. But after she hears"],["2398.64","Ruth's declaration, Naomi is wise enough"],["2402.8","to shut her mouth and let Ruth come with"],["2406.48","her to the land of Yahweh. Verse 18. And"],["2410.8","when she saw that she was determined to"],["2412.72","go with her, she stopped speaking to"],["2416.76","her.

They"],["2500.319","came to Bethlehem and it happened when"],["2501.92","they came to Bethlehem. All the city was"],["2503.68","excited because of them. And the woman"],["2505.119","said, \"Is this not"],["2506.44","Naomi?\" But she said, \"Don't call me"],["2508.839","Naomi. Call me"],["2510.839","Mara. The Almighty has dealt very"],["2513.119","bitterly with me. I went out full and"],["2515.119","the Lord has brought me back empty. Why"],["2516.8","do you call me Naomi? The Lord has"],["2518.8","testified against me. The Almighty has"],["2521.92","afflicted"],["2523.4","me. As we said at the start, God is"],["2526.44","afflicting Naomi."],["2529.48","Why?

So, you know"],["2542.56","what's amazing? We see this time and"],["2544.72","time again. When people go through"],["2546.64","trials and afflictions and return to"],["2548.64","God, they often influence other people"],["2551.839","to come with them. People go out there"],["2554.319","and they live their lives in"],["2555.599","disobedience and sin and they hurt"],["2557.04","themselves and finally they repent and"],["2558.72","they return. And when they do that, they"],["2561.119","end up influencing somebody to come out"],["2562.8","of that mess. Somebody who was in that"],["2564.56","mess with them. It's like, \"Oh, well,"],["2566.24","you're going to go that way. Well, I"],["2567.52","might as well give it a try, too. And"],["2569.76","God always has this way of using our"],["2572","pain and brokenness to help someone"],["2574.52","else.

This is how God will"],["2607.359","use something that seems like it's going"],["2609.04","to destroy us and turn it for good. And"],["2612.56","he loves to do that. Through our"],["2614.96","brokenness and weakness and failure, he"],["2617.28","brings glory to his name.

Last week"],["25.439","we saw Ruth went out looking to find"],["27.76","what was it? Favor. Find favor. And we"],["31.279","learned what exactly favor is and why we"],["34.239","too ought to be looking for it. And we"],["36.48","talked about how to find favor. Sure"],["39.2","enough, Ruth found favor with one of"],["42.04","Naomi's husband's relatives, and his"],["44.879","name is Boaz. Okay. Because of the favor"],["49.28","Boaz shows Ruth, she had a really good"],["52.079","day gleaning barley. So, that's where"],["54.32","we're picking up the story. Chapter 2,"],["56.32","verse number 14. Uh, and it says here,"],["59.6","\"Now Boaz said to her at meal time, come"],["62","here, sit, and eat of the bread and dip"],["66.32","your piece of bread in the vinegar.\" So"],["69.04","she sat beside the reapers, and he"],["71.52","passed her parched grain to her, and she"],["73.2","ate and was satisfied, and kept some"],["75.4","back. And when she rose up to glean,"],["78.24","Boaz commanded the young men, saying,"],["79.92","\"Let her glean even amongst the sheav."],["81.92","Do not reproach her. Also, let grain"],["85.799","from the bundles fall purposely for her."],["88.96","Leave it that she may glean, and do not"],["91.119","rebuke her. So she gleaned in the field"],["93.52","until the evening, and beat out what she"],["95.2","had gleaned. And it was about an ephod"],["98.159","of barley. Then she took it up and went"],["100.799","into the city, and her mother-in-law saw"],["103.119","that what she had gleaned. So she"],["105.28","brought out what and gave her what she"],["107.68","had kept back after she had been"],["110.479","satisfied. and her mother-in-law said to"],["112.399","her, \"Where have you gleaned today? And"],["114.56","where did you work? Blessed be the one"],["117.2","who took notice of you.\" So Naomi"],["120.56","recognizes that Ruth had a really good"],["122.479","day. She has lots of barley, and she"],["124.88","even has some leftovers from lunch that"],["126.799","she brought home to share with Naomi. I"],["129.119","don't know about you, but I like it when"],["131.44","someone brings me some leftovers."],["134.4","Elelliana will go to a lady's fellowship"],["136.08","and she'll sneak out a plate of"],["137.959","leftovers and I think that's really"],["140.239","nice. Not that I need it, but it's"],["143.12","always something tasty. Now, for Naomi,"],["145.599","this is more than just nice. They need"],["148.8","this food because right now they're very"],["152.08","poor and they can't afford to waste"],["155.04","anything. There is a generation of"],["158.16","people here today who were taught waste"],["162.68","not want not. It was practically a sin"],["167.519","to throw food away. You had to clean"],["170.4","your plate. It's a throwback to a time"],["172.959","when folks were had hard times and"],["175.519","getting food on the table was a struggle"],["177.68","in and of itself. So throwing anything"],["179.36","away, you couldn't afford to do that."],["181.76","And you know, like I'll I'll still be at"],["184","restaurants and somebody will order like"],["185.68","a $30 entree and uh leave a third of it"],["188.879","on the plate and I'm just shocked. It's"],["191.519","like that's $10 worth of food right"],["193.36","there. It's like, why don't you take"],["194.959","that home? Take it with you. When"],["197.36","Elelliana and I would take the boys out"],["198.959","to eat, I guarantee you there was never"],["201.36","any leftovers for those guys. But"],["203.84","between the four of us boys, there was"],["206.159","there was nothing left. And still to"],["208.72","this day, if we're at a restaurant and"],["211.04","somebody is full and they're done, you"],["213.28","just kind of hold the plate up and says,"],["214.56","\"Anybody want to finish these fries?"],["217.36","Does anybody want the rest?\" And it's"],["219.36","open season for all of us. Especially if"],["222.239","Roberto's home, he just hawks everything"],["224.56","down now. Ricky used to be the garbage"],["226.64","can, but now Robbie has taken that. And"],["230.239","sometimes, um, I just wants to see them"],["233.44","happy eating, so she doesn't even finish"],["235.36","her food. She just lets them eat it. And"],["237.28","it it's always sad for me because I want"],["239.519","it and she just, you know, prefers"],["243.04","giving it to the boys. So, what can you"],["247.56","do? These boys have been in my way my"],["249.92","whole"],["252.2","life. Verse"],["254.519","18. I'll get counseling. I promise."],["258.88","She took what she went up and went into"],["261.199","the city and her mother-in-law and saw"],["262.96","she had gleaned and she brought out what"],["265.28","she gave her and kept back for her and"],["267.52","was satisfied. And then her"],["269.919","mother-in-law says, \"Where have you"],["271.28","gleaned today?\" Verse 19, \"Where did you"],["273.28","work? Blessed be the one who took notice"],["275.12","of you.\" So, uh, remember that we"],["278.16","learned last week, the assignment wasn't"],["280.52","food. It was to find favor. So, Naomi is"],["284.88","curious. Where did you glean? who took"],["287.36","notice of you? And she says, \"This guy,"],["291.96","Boaz.\" And to Ruth, that's just some"],["294.479","fella she just met out there in the"],["296.32","field. To Naomi, Boaz is so much more."],["300.4","Verse 20, Naomi said to her"],["302.4","daughter-in-law, \"Blessed be he of the"],["304.72","Lord who has not forsaken his kindness"],["307.6","to the living and the dead.\" Naomi said"],["310.08","to her, \"This man is a relation of ours,"],["312.72","one of our close relatives.\" So if you"],["315.84","go back to the beginning of the chapter"],["317.759","verse number one uh we see that there is"],["321.479","a again a emphasis on the relationship"],["326.08","of Boaz the there was a relative of"],["328.4","Naomi's husband a man of great wealth of"],["330.479","the family of IMC his name was Boaz"],["333.28","verse number three uh Ruth went and"],["335.919","gleaned in the fields after the reapers"],["337.759","and she happened to be in the part of"],["339.52","the field belonging to Boaz who was what"],["342.639","of the family of Imc"],["345.4","So out of the first three verses, two"],["348.24","times the story tells us Boaz is a"],["350.72","family member on IMC's side. And uh it's"],["354.24","interesting that the text uses two"],["356.4","different Hebrew words. So in chap"],["358.72","chapter 2 verse one, Moda is the the"],["362","Hebrew word it means kinsman or"],["363.919","relative. Chapter 2:3 it's mitzaka. It's"],["368.639","clan or tribe. And that word carries a"],["371.199","more broader idea. Then we get to verse"],["374.319","number 20 and then again he she uses"],["378.479","these different words. He says this man"],["380.319","is a relation of ours one of our close"],["383.44","relatives and these likewise are"],["385.759","completely different words. It's uh"],["387.919","first relation is kob which means"],["390.4","personal relation. And then the second"],["393.199","word which is uh translated here in the"],["395.919","king new king James one of our close"],["397.84","relatives is"],["400.36","gaal. And that word uh the English"],["404.16","translation here does not do justice to"],["406.96","what gal is. It's very specific. So I"],["410.319","was just wondering why these different"],["412.08","terms. This is something that I think we"],["414.8","can relate to because we will do the"],["416.639","same thing, right? Family is a word that"],["418.88","can mean several things. And if I said"],["421.52","the Mcnut family, those of you been"],["423.68","around here for a while, you just in"],["425.12","intuitively think Rob, Iana, and the"],["427.44","three boys. Uh, but since the boys have"],["429.84","gotten married, now our family has"],["431.919","grown. And so now we got some"],["433.12","daughter-in-laws and they are now part"],["435.039","of the Mcnot family. And for the"],["437.759","wedding, my father and mother and my"],["439.68","sister and her kids were in town and"],["441.68","they too are my family. And then there's"],["444.8","times where you see Illana and his"],["446.72","mother and sister and her children here"],["448.479","and they too are my family. And uh then"],["452","if the daughter-in-laws uh have their"],["454.16","family over here, they too get all"],["456","lumped in as being part of my family."],["458.72","And then I we're going to talk about"],["460","going to Canada to visit uh family up"],["462.479","there. And that's a whole bunch of"],["463.52","people you've never even seen before."],["465.28","And so the word family can mean a whole"],["467.84","pile of people. So in order to be"],["470.479","specific, we use other words. We say"],["473.12","immediate family. We say uh family on my"],["476.72","mother's side, family on my father's"],["478.879","side. We say in-laws, nieces, nephews,"],["481.52","uncles, aunts. Some people call me uncle"],["484.24","Rob. The Spanish side, the kids call me"],["486.8","Tio Rob. Some of the kids who call me"],["489.36","uncle or teo. That's not accurate. I'm"],["491.84","not their uncle. Technically, I'm a"],["493.36","cousin or I'm married to their cousin."],["494.879","But since I'm older, they think of me as"],["497.12","an uncle. And at some point, it really"],["499.199","doesn't matter. All anyone knows is"],["501.199","whoever shows up on Memorial Day for"],["502.879","crabs is considered family. Call me"],["505.919","whatever you want. Pass the crabs."],["509.68","However, when it comes to scripture,"],["512.479","it's not whatever. The relationships are"],["515.68","important and the details matter because"],["518.159","there are laws that govern how these"],["520.8","people are to interact with one another."],["522.8","There are covenants. There are"],["524.72","prophecies spoken. There are specific"],["527.12","things God is doing that is directly"],["529.839","connected to these specific people. See,"],["532.32","these accounts are not fairy tales."],["534.959","They're not myths. They're not folklore."],["537.2","There is historical evidence. There is"],["539.519","textural evidence. There is"],["541.24","archaeological evidence. There is DNA"],["543.839","evidence, genealogies that detail who's"],["547.44","related to who. And it's all important"],["550","because it's all one message, the word"],["552.959","of God. And it's all tied together. So,"],["556.32","in order to accurately interpret it and"],["558.399","fully comprehend it, we need to pay"],["560.24","attention to what the author is"],["562.399","emphasizing. A big importance is being"],["565.12","placed on the family that Ruth has"],["567.76","married into. IMC of the tribe of Judah"],["571.6","of the town of Bethlehem. Have you ever"],["574.56","heard of Bethlehem before? Oh, I think"],["577.279","we remember. Oh, little town. Yeah, you"],["580.399","know that one. It's wrong season. Can't"],["582.399","talk about that now. Boaz is of this"],["584.56","tribe and he is a close relative, a near"],["587.959","relation, which means what? Well, the"],["591.2","word near personal relation. We know"],["593.36","it's not brother because we know the"],["595.04","Hebrew word for brother. It's a it's not"],["598.16","uncle because that's dod. That's the"],["600.16","Hebrew word for uncle. So what could he"],["602.24","be if he's a close relation? He's not an"],["603.68","uncle. He's not a brother. He's a maybe"],["606.36","a cousin. A cousin. My uh grandfather"],["611.839","has passed on.

I I think that's what the"],["756.8","different words for family in chapter 2"],["758.72","is communicating. Naomi in verse 20 is"],["761.279","stressing that Boaz is more than just a"],["763.04","family member. This man is Karob. He's"],["766","near. He's personal relation. He's one"],["768.72","of the"],["770.519","gaal next kinsmen. Now, that word some"],["775","translations and maybe some of your"],["776.88","translations in here will say our"],["778.48","family's redeemer. Anybody got that one"],["780.079","that says family's redeemer? Some of you"],["782","have that. Gal is more than just a"],["784.079","relative. The word carries with it legal"],["786.839","responsibilities. It could be translated"],["789.519","redeemer or even"],["792.279","avenger. Boaz is an avenger. Oo, like"],["795.04","Iron Man or Captain America. Oo, maybe"],["797.92","we have similar similar terminology. We"],["800.639","call it next of kin. It's what we call"],["803.12","the person who's been delegated to deal"],["805.36","with the legal responsibilities of a"],["807.279","loved one once they've passed away."],["809.12","Probably they're going to inherit the"],["811.88","estate and be the one who makes sure the"],["814.48","person's will has been followed. We"],["817.839","don't really have the avenger part, at"],["820.24","least that I'm aware of. Um, but you"],["824.56","know, talking to some of the folks"],["827.639","from the hillbilly side of, you know,"],["831.399","people, did you ever see that movie uh"],["833.519","Next to Kin by Patrick Sees? It's an old"],["835.76","movie, 1989. So, uh, sees from"],["838.92","Appalachia and his brother was a cop in"],["841.68","Chicago who was murdered by the mob and"],["844.88","sees to go to the city and administer"],["847.519","some hillbilly justice. Is that still"],["849.36","going on, Jennifer? Do we still do that?"],["850.88","Still apparently we still do this uh"],["853.6","hillbelly justice thing. Now since he"],["855.68","was next of kin, he had to go avenge his"],["857.6","brother's death. It's a cool movie, but"],["859.44","actually that is Old Testament. It's"],["862.8","part of what is entailed in being God, a"],["865.279","kinsman redeemer. Look at Numbers"],["867.36","chapter 35. Turn to Numbers chapter 35."],["870.399","This is some wild stuff this morning. We"],["872.48","go back into the laws of Moses. Verse"],["875.6","number nine. Moses, Numbers 35, verse"],["877.92","number nine. The Lord spoke to Moses,"],["880.24","saying, \"Speak to the children of Israel"],["882.079","and say to them, 'When you cross the"],["883.6","Jordan into the land of Canaan, then you"],["885.6","will appoint cities to be cities of"],["887.04","refuge for you, that the manslayer who"],["889.839","kills another person accidentally may"],["891.76","flee there.\" Numbers"],["894.44","35:12. They shall be cities of refuge"],["896.8","for you from the avenger. The avenger,"],["899.199","the gaal is the Hebrew, that the"],["902.24","mansllayer may not die until he stands"],["904.56","before the congregation in judgment. And"],["907.199","of the cities which you shall give, you"],["909.12","shall have six cities of refuge. You"],["911.12","shall appoint three cities on this side"],["912.48","of the Jordan, and three cities you"],["913.68","shall appoint in the land of Canaan,"],["914.959","which shall be the cities of refuge."],["916.399","These six cities shall be for refuge for"],["918.32","the children of Israel, for the"],["919.76","stranger, for the sojourer among you,"],["922","that anyone who kills a person"],["924.04","accidentally can flee there. But if he"],["926.8","strikes him with an iron implement so"],["928.24","that he dies, he's a murderer. The"],["930.079","murderer shall be put to death. If he"],["931.839","strikes him with a stone in the hand,"],["933.36","which by which he could die, and he does"],["935.199","die, he's a murderer. The murder will be"],["936.88","put to death.

So, here's what this law is"],["945.519","dealing with. It's dealing with murder"],["947.199","and manslaughter. Someone has lost their"],["949.519","life and now the family avenger, the"],["953.04","goal is hunting the asalent down. In the"],["956.399","Old Testament law, it was eye for an"],["959.16","eye, tooth for tooth, life for life."],["963.12","Now, sometimes death is accidental. And"],["965.759","if you accidentally killed someone, you"],["968.079","fled to a city of refuge. And once you"],["971.36","got there, the gaal, the avenger, could"],["974.24","not kill you until you got a trial. If"],["976.959","it was an unintentional death, your life"],["978.48","would be spared. But if you didn't get"],["980.16","to the city of refuge, the gaal caught"],["981.92","up with you. He could legally kill you."],["984.32","If you unintentionally killed someone,"],["986.32","the kins and redeemer, he was out to get"],["988.8","you. But if you intentionally killed"],["990.32","someone, oh, he you you were done for."],["992.8","Look at verse number uh 19. Uh the"],["995.36","avenger of blood, that's the go all"],["997.68","himself shall put the murderer to death."],["999.44","When he meets him, he'll put him to"],["1000.72","death. If he pushes him out of hatred,"],["1003.199","lying in weight, hurl something to him"],["1005.759","to die, emnity to strike with his hand"],["1008.399","so that he dies. The one who struck him"],["1010","will surely must be put to death. He is"],["1013.279","a murderer. The avenger of blood shall"],["1015.279","put the murderer to death when he meets"],["1016.8","him."],["1018.48","That's what the Gal is. Now, in Naomi's"],["1021.04","case, her husband was not killed. He"],["1023.759","died of, I don't know, disease or"],["1025.28","something, but he wasn't murdered. So,"],["1026.959","Boaz is not required to hunt anybody"],["1029.36","down and kill anybody. But there are"],["1031.199","other jobs that the kinsman redeemer was"],["1033.199","supposed to do. Turn to Leviticus 25."],["1036.72","Leviticus 25"],["1040.6","23 says, \"The land is not to be sold"],["1044.12","permanently.\" This is God speaking. The"],["1046.64","land is mine. You are strangers and"],["1048.88","sojourers with me. And in all the land"],["1051.12","of your possession, you shall grant"],["1053.12","redemption of the land. Redemption of"],["1055.919","the land. Verse 25. If one of your"],["1059.28","brethren becomes poor and has sold some"],["1062.16","of his possession, and if his redeeming"],["1064.32","relative comes to redeem it, then he may"],["1067.12","redeem what his brother sold. Or if a"],["1069.2","man was not with has no one to redeem"],["1071.6","it, but he himself is able to redeem it,"],["1074.4","then let him count the years for the"],["1075.76","sale and restore the remainder to the"],["1077.28","man to whom he sold, he may return to"],["1079.6","his"],["1081","possession. God swore a covenant with"],["1084.12","Abraham that his family would have this"],["1087.039","promised land. God had Moses lead the"],["1090.32","people out of slavery to the promised"],["1093.2","land. God had Joshua conquer the land"],["1096.32","and distribute it between the 12 tribes"],["1098.96","of Israel. That was the fulfillment of"],["1101.039","God's covenant with Abraham. The point"],["1103.36","here is God has given the land to the"],["1106.16","nation of Israel as an inheritance."],["1108.64","Their children are always to inherit the"],["1111.44","land, which means they always have a"],["1113.679","home. The land provides food for the"],["1116.08","people. So they will always be provided"],["1118.24","for. But sometimes people fall on hard"],["1120.48","times. People get sick or injured and"],["1122.64","they can't work the land. Famine comes"],["1124.559","and brings poverty. People can't afford"],["1126.48","to stay on their land. That's what"],["1128","happened with IMC. He sold the land and"],["1130.08","he moved to Moab. That was disastrous"],["1132","move for his family. Nevertheless,"],["1134.4","despite IMC's foolishness and"],["1136.28","disobedience, God has a way for the land"],["1139.76","sold in poverty to be returned back to"],["1142.72","IMC's family because it is IMC's"],["1146.52","eternal"],["1148.28","inheritance. But since IMC sold it, it"],["1151.919","has to be bought back. Legally, it has"],["1155.039","to be sold back. They can't just take it"],["1156.559","back. So, as long as there's a kinsman"],["1158.88","redeemer who can buy it back, he can get"],["1161.2","that land back. This summer, we're going"],["1163.36","to go to Nova Scotia and we're going to"],["1165.52","drive by all these properties that used"],["1167.84","to belong to my"],["1170.28","greatgrandfathers and my grandfathers on"],["1172.799","both sides, father and mother's side."],["1174.88","And I know where these homesteads are,"],["1176.799","and I know where the grave sites are. I"],["1178.799","know where the old farms are. And those"],["1181.28","properties, if I wanted to redeem them,"],["1184.08","my family's homesteads, I would"],["1187.16","need millions of dollars to buy them"],["1191.36","back. Just the house my father built 50"],["1194.08","years ago for"],["1198.2","$19,000. Built his own house for"],["1200.36","$19,000. I was a baby in that house. He"],["1203.039","sold it when I was like four years old."],["1204.88","He was telling us when he was down"],["1206.08","visiting how he built it that he built"],["1208.16","the forms for the septic tank. I was"],["1210.4","like, \"Oo, you built the for he built"],["1212.08","the forms for the foundation to be"],["1214.08","poured in.\" Tony was amazed that he did"],["1216","that. He was 21 years old when he went"],["1218","out and he built all of that with his"],["1220.24","own hands. And if I wanted to buy that"],["1222.24","three-bedroom home back, I would need"],["1226.76","$400,000. In 1975, he sold it for"],["1231.08","$27,000. That's what's going on. I have"],["1234.72","no land inheritance. Even if I had the"],["1237.679","money to buy all these properties back,"],["1239.6","they may not be for sale. And there"],["1241.44","would be no legal way for me to compel"],["1243.12","those people to sell them to me. You"],["1244.559","know, I go in the go into the house and"],["1246.24","say, \"My dad built this house. This is"],["1248.88","my childhood bedroom right here.\" They"],["1251.6","would say, \"Get out of here, crazy"],["1254.52","person.\" 911. I don't know if they have"],["1257.36","911 in Canada. I don't call somebody"],["1260.52","RCMP. I have no inheritance in Canada."],["1263.679","But for the children of Israel, they"],["1266.24","always had ancestral rights, inheritance"],["1269.6","rights to that land. Even if it was"],["1272.32","sold, it had to legally come back to"],["1274.72","them. All you needed was a kinsman"],["1277.44","redeemer who would buy that land back"],["1279.52","for you. Now, the question is, why would"],["1282.64","he want to do that? Why would this"],["1284.799","kinsman redeemer spend his own money to"],["1287.039","buy your land back for you? H let's"],["1291.039","let's wait on that answer. Avenging a"],["1293.76","death and buying back land is part of"],["1295.28","what the kinsman redeemer does. Now"],["1297.2","sometimes someone is so poor they sell"],["1298.919","themselves into debt into slavery. And"],["1303.28","the kinsman redeemer could buy that"],["1305.36","person back out of that debt. That's"],["1308.12","Leviticus 25 47. If a sojourer or a"],["1312.64","stranger close to you becomes rich and"],["1314.799","one of your brother who dwells him"],["1316.48","becomes poor and sells himself to the"],["1318.64","stranger, the sojourer close to you or"],["1320.559","to a member of the stranger's family"],["1322.559","after he's sold, he may buy him back"],["1324.88","again. One of his brothers may redeem"],["1327.28","him. That's ga the same Hebrew word"],["1330.08","redeem him or his uncle or his uncle son"],["1332.88","may redeem him or anyone who is near of"],["1334.559","kkin to him. His family may redeem him"],["1337.039","or if he's able, he can redeem himself."],["1338.96","Well, that sounds horrible. selling"],["1340.64","yourself into slavery. Who would do"],["1342","that? Well, you know, actually pretty"],["1343.2","well all of us, right? For houses and"],["1344.88","cars and credit cards and education, we"],["1346.799","assume debt. And we've agreed to pay"],["1349.76","work and pay that debt. And that person"],["1352.159","who owns our debt, they charge us"],["1354.08","interest, compound interest, 5, 10,"],["1357.96","19%. So, they load that on us unless"],["1362.159","someone with a lot of money wants to pay"],["1364.88","that off for us. Anybody want to pay off"],["1367.28","my credit card? No. Okay. Maybe I'll be"],["1370.159","debtree before I die. Who knows? But a"],["1372.08","kinsman redeemer could buy you out of"],["1374.72","that debt slavery. Now the question is"],["1378.559","once again, why would he want to do"],["1380.72","that? Spend his own money to get you out"],["1382.96","of"],["1384.039","debt. Let's answer that in a minute."],["1386.4","There's yet another duty that the"],["1388.4","kinsman redeemer could assume. And this"],["1390.159","one's really interesting. So if you're"],["1391.84","bored right now, I think I'll get your"],["1393.2","attention on this one. The duty of the"],["1395.919","kinsman redeemer was not limited to"],["1398.24","preservation of the relative or their"],["1400.159","property. They also were required to"],["1403.36","ensure that a relative got a descendant"],["1406.72","in the case of death. If someone died"],["1409.2","without having children, his kinsman"],["1411.52","redeemer, his brother was expected to"],["1413.6","marry the wife in order to preserve the"],["1415.679","name of the one who died through the"],["1417.039","firstborn of that wife."],["1420.28","Deuteronomy 25-10."],["1424.32","Look at this"],["1426.28","one. If a brother dwells together and"],["1429.44","one of them dies and has no son, the"],["1431.919","widow of the dead man shall not marry a"],["1434.799","stranger outside the family, but her"],["1436.4","husband's brother shall go to her, take"],["1438.88","her as wife, perform the duty of a"],["1440.4","husband's brother to her.

But if the man does not want to"],["1452","take his brother's wife, then his"],["1453.919","brother's wife will go up to the gate to"],["1455.76","the elders and say, \"My husband's"],["1458.4","brother refuses to raise up a name to"],["1460.799","his brother in Israel. He will not"],["1463.12","perform the duty of my husband's"],["1465.48","brother.\" Then the elders of the city"],["1467.84","will call and speak to him. But if he"],["1469.52","stands firm and says, \"No, I don't want"],["1471.6","to take her.\" Then the brother's wife"],["1473.679","shall come to him in the presence of the"],["1475.279","elders.

This"],["1496.96","sounds weird to us, but you have to"],["1498.96","understand back in the day, the"],["1500.72","covenants and the blessings of God were"],["1502.96","connected to the land and to your seed,"],["1506.159","to your descendants. The laws were"],["1508.799","there. The laws of Moses were there to"],["1511.36","ensure everyone had blessing through"],["1514.08","your family. You are provided for on"],["1516.799","your family land. So, a father worked"],["1519.279","the land and provided for his wife and"],["1520.96","children. And once he was old, his sons"],["1523.44","and his son-in-laws would work the land"],["1525.679","and provide for him. And once he died,"],["1527.52","the land passed on to them. And they"],["1529.679","continued that same process. But if he"],["1532.08","had no children, once he was old, who"],["1533.76","would provide for him? And if he died"],["1535.36","and his wife was left there with any"],["1537.36","children, who would provide for her? And"],["1539.12","who would get the land? So the kinsman"],["1541.76","redeemer was a way of providing for this"],["1543.84","family in that situation. IMC had land,"],["1548.08","sold it because he was poor, went to"],["1550.4","Moab.

Ruth the Moabus said,"],["1593.52","\"He also said to me,\"You shall stay by"],["1595.6","my young men until they have finished"],["1597.679","all the my harvest.\" And Naomi said to"],["1599.84","Ruth, her daughter-in-law, \"Ooh, it is"],["1602.159","good, my daughter, that you go out with"],["1604.88","these young women, and that people do"],["1606.96","not meet you in any other"],["1609.4","field.\" So she stayed close by the young"],["1612.24","men of Boaz to glean until the end of"],["1614.08","barley harvest and wheat harvest, and"],["1615.84","she dwelt with her mother-in-law. This"],["1617.679","is very intentional, isn't it? It's good"],["1620.159","that people do not meet you in any other"],["1622.48","field, Ruth. Why,"],["1624.84","Naomi? Well, Naomi's got something in"],["1626.96","mind here. For this kinsman, redeemer,"],["1630.72","Boaz. She doesn't want anyone else to"],["1633.12","meet Ruth. H, you got to got a sneaking"],["1636.159","suspicion. Why? Naomi doesn't want"],["1638.799","anyone to meet Ruth because Naomi wants"],["1641.24","Boaz to be the kinsman redeemer. And I"],["1644.96","suspect Ruth is very attractive. And if"],["1648.64","other people meet her, they would"],["1650.48","realize, \"Hey, this family needs a"],["1652.88","kinsman redeemer. I will get a nice"],["1654.799","piece of land and I'll get a pretty"],["1656.48","young wife.\" But Naomi is hatching a"],["1658.96","plan where Ruth gets the kind, wealthy"],["1663.12","Boaz. How's she going to do that? Well,"],["1666.32","you'll have to come back next week to"],["1667.36","find out. So, you got to sit there with"],["1669.12","that. And that's a good reason to come"],["1670.48","back. But maybe you're sitting here and"],["1672.32","you're intrigued by this history lesson."],["1674.64","You know, you like sociology and the"],["1676.96","laws and the customs of ancient Israel,"],["1678.799","but you might be a little confused."],["1679.919","Well, what am I supposed to do with"],["1680.799","this, Pastor Rob? I mean, how is this"],["1682.64","relate to me? So, remember this is not"],["1686.159","just sociology. This is"],["1690.44","theology. And because it's theology, God"],["1694.159","through these laws is teaching us his"],["1696.64","standard for righteousness, his ideas"],["1699.279","for holiness. With this kinsman redeemer"],["1702.08","laws, we see that God has taken into"],["1704.919","consideration failure, poverty, slavery,"],["1708.88","brokenness, sin, and death. And he's"],["1712.159","created a system that can pull people"],["1714.559","out of these horrible situations and"],["1716.64","redeem them from all this debt. God"],["1719.039","cares so much about this that he made it"],["1721.6","law. He made it part of the standard for"],["1723.84","righteousness. He wants people redeemed."],["1727.039","Now the challenge for Naomi and Ruth is"],["1729.6","do we have a gal? Is there someone who"],["1732.399","will redeem us? And the answer is yes."],["1734.799","It's Boaz. He is qualified. He's next of"],["1738.159","kin and he's wealthy. He's got the money"],["1740.559","to do it. So he could, but will"],["1745.32","he? So this is where we finally answer"],["1747.679","the question. The question is why would"],["1750.159","anyone want to be kinsman and redeemer?"],["1752.24","Why would anyone want to pay someone"],["1754.64","else's debts? Why would anyone want to"],["1756.559","sacrifice their resources? Why would"],["1758.64","someone want to take the responsibility"],["1760.32","of raising an heir on the behalf of"],["1762.64","another? Why do you want to provide for"],["1764.48","someone else's family? And the answer to"],["1766.799","that has got to"],["1768.919","be"],["1770.52","love. It's got to be love. Boaz is going"],["1773.76","to do this because Ruth found favor in"],["1777.2","his eyes. And Boaz is about loyalty to"],["1780.24","family and about loving his family."],["1784.48","This is Memorial Day weekend and we"],["1787.36","remember people who sacrificed for our"],["1790.159","freedoms. People who sacrificed for our"],["1792.799","country, people who fought to avenge and"],["1796.44","defend. And nobody signed up thinking,"],["1798.72","\"Oh man, I really hope I can die. Hope I"],["1800.72","can just, you know, get in a battle over"],["1802.64","some"],["1803.399","wast.\" But when they signed up, they"],["1805.84","knew that would be an option. So they"],["1807.84","had to think, am I okay with"],["1810.76","that? And then they concluded."],["1813.84","I'm prepared to sacrifice for the good"],["1816.32","of people. Jesus says, \"Greater love has"],["1820.399","no man than this, that a man would lay"],["1823.039","down his life for his friends.\" And"],["1825.12","Jesus knew what he was talking about."],["1827.039","The kinsman redeemer from the laws of"],["1829.36","Moses from the story of Ruth is God's"],["1832.08","way of explaining to us how much he"],["1834.52","cares. That love and loyalty are core"],["1838.559","values. And you know this John 3:16, for"],["1842.559","God so loved the world that he gave his"],["1846.48","only begotten son that whosoever"],["1848.72","believes in him will not perish but have"],["1852.559","everlasting life. God cares about us and"],["1855.36","has a plan to redeem us back out of debt"],["1859.559","slavery. A way to make us"],["1863.399","hes and provide all the promised"],["1866","blessings to all of us. It is through"],["1869.36","the kinsman redeemer. Someone who has"],["1871.919","the resources and someone who has the"],["1874.08","love and loyalty to family to want to"],["1876.72","save us. And this was what God was"],["1878.96","planning through the line of Abraham. He"],["1881.6","incorporated the plans in the law of"],["1883.6","Moses. He enacted a literal biological"],["1886.48","line through Judah that's running"],["1889.279","through this story right here leading at"],["1891.84","the end of Ruth to King David which"],["1894.08","ultimately leads to Jesus Christ. Jesus"],["1898","is the son of God, but he is literally a"],["1900.64","physical son of man. He has a historical"],["1904.279","biological genealogy that connects him"],["1906.96","to the kinsman redeemer. Jesus is flesh"],["1909.519","and blood. He is our brother. He is our"],["1912.32","near relative. He has the resources and"],["1915.12","he has the love to compel him to redeem"],["1917.679","us."],["1919.64","So,"],["1922.2","amen. God's plan for humanity is"],["1925.039","redemption. And Paul lays it all out for"],["1927.12","us in Ephesians chapter 1.

So we we live with the in-laws. We"],["2056.159","were 14 months. Now what I didn't tell"],["2058.879","you is one month in they sold their"],["2062.2","house.

We're going to sell it.\" And so"],["2069.76","we packed her right back up again and uh"],["2072.48","we had to move out. But um in between"],["2075.52","selling the old house and buying a new"],["2076.96","house, there was like a month that we"],["2078.879","had no place to"],["2080.28","live. So we lived in our minivan. No, we"],["2083.879","didn't. Leiana's aunt, Zoa, said,"],["2086.72","\"That's no problem. You can just stay"],["2088.639","with me.\" At the time, she had a"],["2090.599","townhouse.

But that's"],["2126.8","just how Aliana's family operates and"],["2128.72","just take care of each other. And that's"],["2131.2","what this story is teaching us.
