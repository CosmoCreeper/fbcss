[{"id":"GU324q60DxI","name":"2025-10-19  One Accord in Jesus' Name (Pastor Rob McNutt)","date":"2025-10-19","transcript":[["21.68","Well, last week we heard the instructions that Jesus gave to the disciples in Acts chapter 1 verse number"],["30.72","four that they were to not leave Jerusalem"],["37.12","uh but wait for the promise of the Father promise of the father. Is it the crown?"],["44.64","Is it the kingdom? No, it's not the kingdom. It's"],["51.039","power. You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you being my"],["56.399","witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the ends of the earth. That's the"],["62.16","last word spoken by Jesus during his earthly ministry. And now we will turn"],["67.68","our attentions to the acts of the apostles. So verse number 12 and we need to know"],["74.24","well who are these guys exactly. So Acts 1:12 they returned to Jerusalem from the"],["81.36","mount of Olivet which is near Jerusalem a Sabbath day's journey. And when they entered, they went up to the upper room"],["88.479","where they were staying. Peter, James, John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son"],["95.6","of Alphus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. These all continued"],["101.36","with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary the"],["106.479","mother of Jesus and with his brothers. So here they travel a Sabbath days"],["112.24","journey back to Jerusalem. Well, how long is that? Well, that's half a mile. According to Jewish traditions, that's"],["119.119","as far as you could walk on a Sabbath. Any further than that would be considered work and thus breaking of the"],["124.799","Sabbath. So, they're allowed to travel a half a mile. Who's in the upper room? Luke gives us the roll call. Starting"],["130.72","off, first of all, is Peter, the leader, the rock. We know"],["135.92","Peter well. He's very outspoken. Uh he'd even argue with Jesus."],["141.2","Also is James. and he too has a fiery temperament."],["146.64","Both these guys kind of argumentative and edgy and yet here they are as part of Jesus disciples and even in Jesus"],["155.12","inner circle who's also in the inner circle you remember John the beloved right those three but"],["162.72","let's be honest like these two disciples Peter and James men"],["171.12","are prone to being disagreeable hotheaded impatient, quick to speak"],["177.76","without thinking things through, quick to wrath. These disciples are young fellas. Younger fellas, probably younger"],["183.44","than Jesus. Younger guys are even more edgy, more eager to fight."],["190.72","If you are going to be a leader of men, you have to deal with some crankiness,"],["196.4","some edgginess, some questioning. Amen. I've known, man, you're into this today,"],["201.92","aren't we? I've known pastors who could not handle anyone questioning or disagreeing with"],["208.879","them. But Jesus had to deal with that within his disciples. So nobody"],["216.879","gets 100% buy in on all their ideas. So mental note, if you're aspiring to lead"],["222","something and you're pitching new ideas and you're trying to make change, you should assume you should plan for a time"],["228.64","of questioning and disagreements. You should invite questions. You should"],["234.239","foster conversations because there's no avoiding people's natural tendency to be"],["240","disagreeable. If you're going to lead people, then you're going to have to work with that"],["246.159","tendency. Our treasurer, Mark Newkerk, is beginning the uh process of building"],["252.64","the 2026 budget. I started it last month. It's a three-month process. lots"],["258.4","of meetings, discussions, questions, disagreements within the leadership and then we try to get it out to you all uh"],["264.96","two to three weeks before the annual meeting so you could have a time to question it and discuss it and argue"],["271.52","with us and that's just part of working with people. All right, let's go back to the disciples and uh meet some more of"],["278.16","them. Then we got John the beloved uh which is the brother of James Andrew who is the brother of Peter. Now he's more"],["285.28","even killed. He's he's more humble. Andrew is obviously very spiritually in tune because he was a follower of John"],["292.32","the Baptist before he was a disciple of Jesus. He seems to be able to discern the working of the Lord because he's two"],["299.04","for two in believing in both the ministry of John the Baptist and finding"],["304.479","the Messiah. Next is Philillip who's a very analytical person. He too u"],["311.759","declared we have found the Messiah and he brought Nathaniel to Jesus but he's"],["317.199","also not afraid to ask questions. He asked Jesus uh remember how are we going to feed these multitudes? Send them"],["323.68","away. We can't we can't buy food to feed all these people. He also asked Jesus show us the father. So Philip likewise"],["330.16","has a tendency to analyze and ask good questions. And we'll learn more about Philip's acts when we get further on in"],["336.479","the book. Thomas names affiliated with"],["342.08","doubting doubting Thomas. Unless I see and touch the wounds and put my hands in"],["348","the holes, I will not believe. A little bit of a contankerousness there in him too. Bartholomew also called Nathaniel."],["356.16","And uh many of these guys have more than one name which makes reading the gospels and trying to keep everyone straight a"],["361.199","little bit tricky. But Philip has brought Nathaniel to Jesus. He told Nathaniel, \"We have found the one Moses"],["367.6","wrote about in the laws and about who the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth. He is the son of Joseph.\" And"],["373.12","Nathaniel's response was, \"Nazareth? Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\""],["379.039","Jesus saw Nathaniel coming from a far off. And he said, \"Uh, a true Israelite in whom there is nothing false.\" And"],["386.96","then Jesus revealed that he'd seen Nathaniel sitting under a fig tree when, uh, Philip called him. And uh when Jesus"],["394.479","called Nathaniel a true Israelite, it the Lord affirmed his character as being a godly man, receptive to the Lord's"],["401.12","work. And then Jesus simple demonstration of his omniscience uh was enough to make Bartholomew change his"],["407.36","tone. He went from can anything good come out of Nazareth to oh you are the divine son of God. You are the king of"],["412.96","Israel. And Jesus is like really? It's cuz I said I saw you under a fig tree. I will show you a whole lot more. Next is"],["419.199","Matthew. Matthew was a tax collector. He which means he probably was uh very"],["425.52","wealthy and yet he abandoned that to follow Jesus which is a very very very"],["432.639","hard thing to do to leave the things of this world security and prosperity and seek first the kingdom. Now to the"],["440.24","Pharisees and the average Israelites, Matthew would have been a horrible sinner, a thief, a traitor of his"],["447.919","people, of his countrymen. But Matthew illustrates to us the grace of God and"],["453.919","the transformative power of Jesus. And we're thankful for that, aren't we?"],["458.96","Because you can be affiliated with the horrible actions and yet be accepted by"],["464.4","Jesus and transformed. James the son of Eltheus, also called James the Lesser,"],["471.199","least known, least mentioned disciple, doesn't get any quotes in the New"],["476.639","Testament. Simon the Zealot. The Zealots were a Jewish sect that were bent on"],["482.16","revolution, looking for the Messiah who would violently overthrow over overthrow Rome. That was their vision of what the"],["489.199","Messiah was going to do. So probably Simon the Zealot would have been into the uh you know the no kings revolution"],["494.4","this weekend been all excited about that type of action political action. And"],["500.56","then we have Judas the son of James. His other name was Thaddius. Uh possibly the"],["508.08","author of the book of Jude. Lucky for him, he has another name to go by because there was another Judas who was"],["514.959","a disciple. And that was Judas who betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver."],["521.36","He led the temple guard at night to where Jesus was staying so they could arrest him in secret. And this helped"],["527.92","the Sanhedrin avoid the crowds. And that Judas will forever be known as the"],["533.519","betrayer. And that is still on the minds of the disciples which we'll see later"],["539.04","on in this chapter. But the naming of the disciples is how the book of acts begins. These are people whose faith and"],["546","works were foundational to who we are, what we believe, and how we live today."],["551.44","Take for example the detail here. We see in verse 14 that they all continued."],["556.88","Here's the action. with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women"],["562","and Mary and the mother of Jesus and with his brothers. So the detail of the"],["567.839","inclusiveness of the women, I think that's very interesting. Luke always uh speaks the most about the women and the"],["573.519","ladies that were in and around the the uh the entourage of Jesus. It it's it's"],["578.959","interesting because in the ancient world prior to Christianity, women were very"],["584.08","much viewed as inferior to men. The Greek wives were to be at home and"],["589.12","completely separate from the everyday comingings and goings of the their husbands and the men in society. Roman"],["594.72","men had legal guardianship over their wives which meant the women had limited"],["600.16","rights and freedoms and often were treated as property. Jesus involvement"],["605.279","and inclusion of women in his ministry showcased what Paul instructs the church"],["610.32","in Galatians where he says there's neither Jew nor Greek. There's neither slave nor free. There is neither male or"],["615.76","female. We are all one in Christ Jesus. One in Christ. Jesus illustrated or"],["623.2","instructed in Matthew chapter 19. He said uh let the little children come to me and forbid them not for such is the"],["629.92","kingdom of God. And the gospel is for all of humanity regardless of age or"],["635.76","gender or nationality. The western cultures understanding that all men are"],["641.2","created equal. There is liberty and justice for all. Women are to have equal rights. These values find their genesis"],["648.64","in the word of the Lord, especially the words and the acts of Jesus. Now, these"],["655.2","men and women are foundational to what we're doing here 1,970 years later."],["660.959","Their faith and works are examples to us. And even their names are imitated by"],["666.16","us. We use the same names. How many John's are here? It's the most popular name in this church is John. And we got"],["673.2","lots of John's. Uh Mary's, we have Mary's in this church. We have Peter's. We got James's. We got Jimmy's, right?"],["681.36","Andrews, Phillips, Thomas', Matthews. We had a Nate up here this morning."],["686.48","Nathaniel, right? Any Judas's?"],["691.839","That was once a very popular name in uh Israel. And so much so there was two disciples named Judas. the other um was"],["700.16","the author um of a book in the Bible. But uh you know it was there was it was"],["706.24","kind of complicated with the uh authors of the gospels. They had to kind of"],["711.279","qualify this is Judas the Saggariat speaking or this is the other Judas. But can you imagine having a name that"],["716.56","everyone affiliates with some someone who's evil? Now I I'm not sure you've noticed but I"],["724.72","have a rather unique last name. She knows that many people never heard of the name McNut until they met me. And"],["732.32","that's okay because it's given me the opportunity to control the branding."],["738.48","What comes to mind? What attributes do you associate with the name McNut and uh"],["744.72","I I get to control the narrative since there's so few of us. About eight years ago was one afternoon at the fair."],["750.56","Illean and I were at the hall where they uh you know stuff all the nonprofits out of the way where we can just not bother"],["756.32","anybody. And we were over there in the little hall and we were at the KCA table, Kings Christian Academy. And uh"],["762.72","I'm standing there and we're handing out, you know, I don't know why we're handing out stuff. And then um I look"],["768","over here and buddy beside me, he's got a name tag on and it says uh Pastor Tim"],["773.36","McNut. And I says uh Pastor McNut. Well, that's my name too. I'm Pastor Rob"],["779.36","McNut. and he said, \"I have heard of you.\" And uh we struck up a conversation. He was the pastor at the"],["785.279","uh Charlotte Hall Lutheran Church. And uh he says to me as we're talking, he"],["790.56","said, \"Well, do you happen to know Eugene McNut?\" He was a pastor from Canada who I met uh he was in the uh uh"],["798.24","Christian Missionary Alliance uh denomination. And he said, \"I met that guy and we used to always joke that we were related.\" And I said, \"Well, as a"],["804.959","matter of fact, I have heard of Pastor Eugene Mcnut. He is the first cousin to my father, Pastor Bob Mcnut. Have you"],["812.639","noticed the theme for Pastor McNuts? Now, the other Mcnut"],["819.04","I used to hear a lot about when I was growing up was a fellow whose name was Tal McNut. Anybody ever heard of Tal"],["824.639","McNut? Okay. He he he was a young when I was young in ministry, people would say,"],["830.16","\"You are you related to Tal?\" Uh, his name is Tolbert. Tolbert Tal Mcnut was"],["835.519","born in 1923 in New York City. Uh served in World War II, stationed in Japan. He"],["841.68","founded Tokyo Youth for Christ Ministries and Tal came home from the war and he devoted his life to youth"],["849.279","ministry, directed Boston Youth for Christ, started teen Bible clubs, did"],["854.8","evangelistic crusades all through New England up into the Maritime Provinces. He founded the Happy Tea Ranch in New"],["861.68","Hampshire, which is now called the uh White Mountain Ranch. I don't know if Becky, you've heard of the White Mountain Ranch, but he was in full-time"],["868.16","ministry until he passed away in 2010. He was 87 years old. You can Google Tal"],["874.56","McNutton and find all that out. So, while I do have a rare name that not many people heard of before, uh folks"],["881.519","who have known it have affiliated it with ministers, people trying to serve"],["886.56","the Lord. Well, that's better than Judas. The other Judas, he had to short his name to Jude. And even though he wrote a"],["892.72","book in the Bible, the name Judas is not affiliated with the good Judas. It's always affiliated with the traitor. The"],["898.959","traitor. You know, there's a lot of a lot of pregnant moms here, a lot of babies being born. And I say, \"Oh,"],["904.079","what's the baby's name?\" And nobody ever says, \"Uh, we named him Benedict Arnold.\""],["910.399","Not a lot of kids named Adolf. What does your name get affiliated with?"],["919.199","What is your reputation? Is it a name that makes people say, \"That's a guy I would trust. That that dude, he's"],["926","dependable. That gal, you know, she is so loving and kind, always giving and"],["931.04","sacrificing. That that person's wise, very respectable.\" Or does it have a"],["936.16","poor affiliation? You know, he he's a mess. He's very unreliable."],["942.56","You know, she's such a drama queen, you know, self-centered."],["949.279","Not everything affiliated with my name is positive. I've been described as an aggressive"],["955.6","driver. That's my wife's. She affiliates with my name. Very competitive. Uh some accuse"],["962.959","me of stretching rules in order to win. Maybe. Or maybe they're just sore losers. I mean,"],["971.44","forgetful that that's an affiliation I I can never live down. Not great attention"],["977.04","to details. So, there's a lot of poor qualities for me to continue to work on."],["982.48","If we would like our names to have positive affiliations, then we have to actually be about those character"],["988.88","qualities. We need to be doing things that we would like to be affiliated with. If we want to be loving and kind"],["995.6","and patient and meek, then those aren't those aren't things that we naturally are. Those are fruits of the spirit."],["1004.16","So, we need the holy spirit to help us generate those things in our lives. We"],["1010.24","need the holy spirit to change us to be these things. Uh they they all continued uh all the list of the disciples their"],["1017.04","names in one accord in prayer and supplication. Uh and and that was the"],["1022.639","other observation I made of the the the description Luke uses. One accord homo"],["1030.16","is the Greek word. It means unanimously. And I noticed that Luke really likes"],["1035.439","this word. He uses it 12 times throughout the book. And sometimes it's describing the work of the apostles in"],["1041.439","the church, how they were together in one accord. We see in Acts chapter 2 as"],["1046.48","an example, they continued daily with one accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house. They ate their"],["1051.84","foods with gladness and simplicity of heart. And then likewise uh through the hands of the apostles, many signs and"],["1056.96","wonders were done among the people and all the growing church was in one accord"],["1062.08","in the temple at Solomon's porch. Other times, one accord is used to describe the actions of the Pharisees, the"],["1067.84","religious leaders of the nation of Israel. when they were attacking the apostles, they were doing it uh in one"],["1075.039","accord. And uh and then we see the mob would react uh in one accord when they"],["1081.28","were uh uh violently attacking the apostles. But we see in Acts chapter 18, Galileo was a protocol uh and the Jews"],["1089.12","were in one accord when they rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat. And so then we see in"],["1095.2","chapter 19, once again, the whole city was filled with confusion. And this is uh when they all were uh aggravated and"],["1102.08","they grabbed uh Gallas and uh this fellow's name who's a Macedonian and they were Paul's companions and they"],["1108.799","arrested them and they were all spooled off. They had this mom mentality where they were all acting in one accord. The"],["1116.16","point being in whatever situation that phrase is used being in one accord always provided strength and power to"],["1123.2","the group. There's a level of overwhelming force behind those who are"],["1128.64","standing in one accord. Due to the fact that you"],["1133.76","Luke uses the term often, I feel that it illustrates to us a biblical principle that is spoken of. First of all, we see"],["1139.679","it in wisdom literature. Ecclesiastes chapter 4, the one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves, a threest"],["1147.28","string cord is not quickly broken. We see it there and then we see it re repeated in the biblical principles"],["1153.919","mandated in the letters of the apostle Paul where he says to the church I therefore the prisoner of the Lord"],["1160","beseech you walk worthy of your calling which you're called. Here's how he describes that calling with all"],["1165.12","loneliness and gentleness longsuffering bearing one another in love endeavoring"],["1170.16","to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one"],["1177.2","spirit just as you are called by one hope. your calling. One Lord, one faith,"],["1182.24","one baptism, one God and father of all who is above all through all and in you"],["1187.52","all. Paul teaches and then we also see this reflected in what Jesus prays for his"],["1195.84","followers to have this. I do not pray for these alone but also those who will believe in me through their word. So"],["1201.679","he's praying for his disciples but he says not just for them but for those who believe because of their word. So that's"],["1207.039","who that's us. Jesus is praying for us. What does he pray for us? Verse 21. That"],["1214.559","they may all be one as you, Father, are in me and I in you. That they may also"],["1220.72","be one in us. That the world may believe that you sent me. And the glory which"],["1227.12","you gave me, I have given them that they may be one just as we are one. I in them and you in me. and they may be made"],["1234.799","perfect in one that the world may know that you sent me and have loved them as"],["1240","you loved me. The reoccurring theme in scripture is unity oneness."],["1247.28","One of the challenges of coming back after being away for a whole month was gathering everyone back together to"],["1254.08","ensure that we are all still in one accord. We elders hadn't met since"],["1259.76","August and there was a lot of things to catch up on and some discussions and decisions had gotten put on hold and we"],["1265.28","needed to review and reaffirm our plans and I had to catch up with the staff and"],["1270.64","with all the ministry leaders and with people who needed reassurance that we are still united. Got to make sure we're"],["1277.679","all on the same page. We value unity and I wanted to"],["1283.6","illustrate how we endeavor to accomplish that here at Faith Bible Church for you to better understand the philosophies of"],["1289.76","leadership that we are adhering to. So within our leadership, we operate as a"],["1295.039","plurality of elders. So it's not just, you know, Pastor Rob's the big cheese and pastor Mark does everything he says."],["1301.679","No, not at all. We are a plurality meaning we all the different elders are working together to in harmony to make"],["1309.2","decisions. Uh we have leadership classes. We do three classes. Uh one's on character of a biblical leader uh on"],["1316.88","the doctrines of the church and then uh we do a hermeneutic class which pastor"],["1321.919","Greg teaches uh principles of biblical interpretation. And this training helps"],["1327.039","all the leadership coming into the church to be on the same page. the leadership can all understand the"],["1333.28","biblical principles and so that we can all work together in one accord, not"],["1339.039","divided. Right? Well, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under"],["1346.64","God, indivisible. Well, that's no longer an accurate"],["1352.08","description, now is it? We are very divided. There is practically nothing"],["1359.919","that people agree on anymore. And a house divided against itself"],["1364.96","cannot stand. The prophet Amos said this in uh Amos chapter 3. He said, \"Can two"],["1371.6","walk together unless they agree?\" The mistake being na made in the nation"],["1378.64","is also made in the church. The churches of America are not of one accord."],["1384.48","Consequently, the people of faith have received mixed messages, contradictory messages, and there's very little I can"],["1391.12","do about the churches in America. But a Faith Bible Church, we have to be of one"],["1396.32","accord. It's easy to say. It's not so easy to do. In order to make it a reality, it"],["1403.12","requires commitment to the concept of unity, indivisible."],["1409.6","So, as an elder board, we endeavor to make decisions that everyone agrees with. We don't take votes in the"],["1416.72","majority rules, right? So, you know, well, it's 5 to three, so you know, never mind, Pastor Mark and John"],["1422.799","Murdoch, just be quiet. We voted you down, right? That's not how we operate."],["1428","Uh we if one if one elder has a concern with something we're doing, uh we don't"],["1433.76","press the issue. we will we will pause and we'll take time to listen and reflect and we'll even go away from"],["1439.12","meetings and pray about something dive into the biblical instructions and seek"],["1444.24","to apply them accurately to the scenario that we're debating since we believe in"],["1449.52","the concept of one accord. We want uh unanimous decisions. We want everyone"],["1455.76","agreeing and satisfied with the decision. And as we strive for this at"],["1461.52","every level of relationship in this church, that's what we're aiming for."],["1466.64","But it's not easy, is it? Because, you know, people got strong opinions on different issues. There's uh opinions on"],["1473.76","rights and freedoms and people got opinions on, you know, proper medical care and educational options. And"],["1480.24","there's opinions on outreach and community interaction, opinions about politics, about finances. There's"],["1486.32","opinions about music. There's opinions galore. And everyone's entitled to their opinions. But when the"],["1493.84","opinions drive us to division and disunityity, that's when we have to"],["1498.96","evaluate the motives. Our mission is simple to glorify God by"],["1504.159","sharing the good news of Christ in establishing believers to pursue God's plans for their lives. And our"],["1511.76","authoritative foundation for what we're doing is the word of God. 2 Timothy"],["1517.52","2:16-1 17 says, \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for"],["1524.24","doctrine, reproof, correction, instruction in righteousness, that the"],["1529.679","man of God, the woman of God might be complete, thoroughly equipped for every"],["1535.76","good work.\" The word of God is the standard that determines what is right and wrong, what is true and what is"],["1542.72","false. And if we are steadfast in our commitment to love God and keep his commandments, that value will pull us"],["1550.88","together, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. The"],["1557.2","enemy uses the strategy divide and conquer. And it works so well"],["1564.159","to break up homes, communities, societies, churches."],["1569.679","We learned when we were over in Germany that the Germans pay a tax. They called"],["1574.88","it a church tax. They pay a a tax comes out of their income and it goes directly"],["1580.32","to the church. And uh wow, you know, wow, the and it's not all churches. It's"],["1585.679","the Lutheran church. So, well, man, the Lutheran church, they must really be very effective uh with all that money."],["1592.159","They're probably doing great things for God. Nope. They are ineffective and almost dead. The buildings are empty and"],["1599.36","uh they don't even let anybody else use them.

Satan wants us divided. And Jesus prays that we would all be"],["1696.559","one. So each and every one of us must be responsible"],["1701.6","for the part that we play in being of one accord.

We all have a part to play. We all have a role to fulfill in the body. The disciples were in one"],["1721.6","accord in prayer and supplication.

That's an investment of"],["1757.76","time. But we believe it is an act of faith. What we do here on Sunday mornings is what the followers of Jesus"],["1765.2","were doing in the upper room, right? When we sing praises in one accord, uh"],["1770.799","when we are uh praying together in one accord, we're in one accord.

The Fellowship of the Ring was the first part of that"],["31.84","three-part series. And I watched it, was totally immersed in the experience. And"],["37.36","when the movie ended, I was so frustrated because the movie was over, but the saga"],["46.079","was just beginning. And since I never read the books, I didn't know how it was going to what was going to happen next."],["52.32","Maybe I should read. I don't know. But uh at the end of the movie, The Fellowship of the Ring was fractured."],["57.84","The main main characters were killed. Orcs and evil were winning. Froto and his friends were in danger and it would"],["64.64","be another whole year before the next movie came out. So, I didn't know what was going to happen next."],["72.08","The New Testament begins with the four gospel accounts, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Whichever one you read, or if"],["79.119","you read through all of them, you're left with the same question after watching the Lord of the Rings first"],["85.52","movie. What's happening next? Matthew chapter 28 ends like this. The last"],["91.2","chapter of Matthew, the 11 disciples went away into Galilee to the mount which Jesus appointed them. Jesus came"],["96.72","and spoke to them saying, \"All authority is given to me in heaven and on earth. Go make disciples of all nations."],["102","Baptize them in the name of the father, son, and the holy spirit, seeking to observe all that I've commanded you to"],["107.439","do. Lo, I'm with you always till the end of the earth.\" End of chap of end of the book of Mark. And he said to them, \"Go"],["114.56","into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved. He who does"],["120.479","not believe will be condemned. So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, sat down at"],["126.56","the right hand of God, and they went out preaching everywhere as the Lord working with them, confirming the word through"],["132.319","the accompanying signs in the book of Luke. Luke ends this way. He said to"],["137.68","them, \"Thus it is written, and thus it is necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third"],["143.52","day, and that repentance or remission of sin will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem. You'll"],["149.84","be my witnesses of these things.

And it came to pass while he blessed them, he parted from them, carried up"],["169.36","into heaven, and they worshiped and returned to Jerusalem with great joy."],["176","That's how the earthly ministry of Jesus concludes. But the saga is just beginning. And"],["184.64","that's what Acts is. What happens next? The acts of the apostles once Jesus"],["191.519","leaves. turn to chapter one as we start in with this study. So um as we did last"],["199.84","week, chapter 1 vers1, the former account I made, O Theophilles, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach"],["205.68","until the day which he was taken up after through the Holy Spirit having given commandments to the apostles whom"],["211.2","he had chosen, to whom he presented himself alive after his suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by"],["217.84","them during 40 days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God."],["223.84","And being assembled together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise"],["230.56","of the Father, which he said, you have heard of me. For John surely baptized"],["236.72","with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit, not many days from"],["243.2","now. Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the"],["249.76","kingdom of Israel? And he said to them, \"It is not for you to know the times and"],["255.12","the seasons which the Father has put in his own authority, but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon"],["261.199","you. You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the ends"],["267.68","of the earth.\" Now when he had spoken these things, while they watched, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out"],["274.8","of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly towards heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in"],["281.919","white apparel, who also said, \"Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into"],["287.919","heaven? This same Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven will so come in"],["293.04","like manner as you saw him go up into heaven.\" So Luke gives his audience, who's his"],["300.24","audience? Who's the book written to? Theophilles. Who's Theophilus? What does"],["306.4","his name mean? I heard a good sermon on that recently. Friend of God. If you are a friend of"],["313.199","God, this you're theophilus and this book is written to you. That's kind of a big deal. So, last week we learned how"],["319.12","to be a friend of God. Go back. All you creative guys, go back and watch it. It's a pretty good sermon. Luke begins"],["326.56","Acts with a summary. In my previous account, I told you all about Jesus, who"],["331.68","he was, what he did. That was the book of Luke. His amazing teachings, his miraculous acts. He chose disciples. He"],["337.84","mentored them. He was crucified. He rose again. Presented himself to all of his followers for 40 days. And he gave them"],["345.28","instructions which were what? What were the instructions? Verse number four."],["351.919","You have heard from me that John baptized with water, but you will baptize with the Holy Spirit not many"],["357.84","days from now. So he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem but to wait there for the promise."],["365.6","Now that information ought to elicit some questions."],["371.919","Who or what is the Holy Spirit? What does it mean to be baptized without"],["378.24","water? How many days are we to stay in Jerusalem? It's kind of unsafe there right now. Like you know they just got"],["384.24","crucified. And what are you going to be doing, Jesus? where what's going to happen with you based on what Jesus just"],["391.919","said those would have been logical questions what question do they ask"],["397.6","verse number six their question is Lord will you at this"],["403.52","time restore the kingdom of Israel"],["409.759","did that have anything to do with what Jesus just instructed not really why did they ask that"],["415.919","question because it was what the disciples had expected. It's what they had originally"],["423.12","signed up to be disciples for the kingdom of God, the kingdom of"],["430.4","Israel. So when will you restore is the question. The Greek word for restore is"],["436.88","apocahmy. It means restore to a former state or"],["442.08","maybe reassemble. See, at one point there was a kingdom. Something happened to it. It's been"],["448.16","broken down. And they're excited for Jesus to reassemble it. At the time of"],["455.919","the writing of the book of Acts, Israel was not an independent nation. They were an occupied people. They were ruled over"],["462","by the Roman Empire, which means they were subjects of Rome. They were under"],["467.12","Roman law. They had to pay Roman taxes. They had to yield to Roman authorities. and they had foreign Roman troops"],["474.639","occupying their land. Now, that's not a new situation for Israel. Before Rome"],["479.68","took over the land, the Israelites were under the authority of the Greeks. And we don't hear a lot about that because"],["486.319","that was uh during the intertestamental period, also called the 400 years of"],["494.24","silence. Why? Well, the last prophet sent by God from"],["500.479","the Old Testament was the prophet Malachi. That was in 420 BC. And no word"],["507.039","of the Lord came for 400 years. Not to say that there was no revelations or no"],["512.64","explanations of what was going on. Actually, the prophet Daniel had been g had been given incredibly detailed"],["519.76","accounts of all that the nation of Israel was going to go through and exactly how long would it be till the"],["525.44","Messiah arrives. That's uh chapters 9- 12 of the book of Daniel. The people"],["530.8","watching Daniel's prophecies being fulfilled before their very eyes, if they were paying attention to that book,"],["537.76","they would have known what was going on, what the empires were, and they if they"],["543.12","had interpreted it properly, they would have been fully aware. But that's the"],["548.16","challenge now, isn't it? Interpreting it properly because we have God's word. We"],["554","have all this revelation but often people do not interpret it properly. Uh"],["561.04","many churches do not use a literal historical grammatical consistent"],["566.16","hermeneutic. Well, why not? Well, because you know there's things that God said we don't agree with and there's"],["573.04","things that we don't find acceptable and some of these doctrines are offensive or"],["578.16","you know people in the congregation, they're going to get a little weirded out by it. So, let's just ignore those parts. It's confusing. It's hard. It's"],["585.76","It's challenging to live by. So, we'll pick and choose the parts that we want"],["591.519","to accept. How about that? It's called 400 years of silence, but"],["598.56","there was plenty of prophecies to pay attention to, and Israel pretty well missed all of them."],["604.959","Now here we have been 1,925 years since the last prophecy since the"],["611.04","author was last author was inspired by the Holy Spirit to write the word of God. 1,925 years of silence. Is God"],["619.76","silent with us? No. Because the word of God is d is"],["625.68","dynamic. It's quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword that"],["631.44","divides us under soul and spirit. joint and marrow and is a discerner of the"],["636.8","thoughts and the intents of our very heart. We need to listen to it and"],["642","interpret it properly and apply it consistently to our everyday lives. But"],["647.76","the disciples back in their time being occupied by Rome before them the 400 years of"],["654.56","silence that was during the Greeks occupation and then before the Greeks it was the Persians and then before the"],["659.6","Persians it was the Babylonians and they had been ruled over and and oppressed by"],["665.279","these world empires for 600 years. So none of Jesus disciples knew anything"],["671.68","about being a free independent people. They were a conquered, oppressed people,"],["678.32","but they had read about a time when things were different. When will you"],["683.36","restore the kingdom of Israel? They were thinking about a time in the Old Testament when the nation of Israel was"],["689.68","not divided into two kingdoms. They were thinking about a time when they had a great king who led them to victory over"],["695.279","their enemies. They were thinking about a time when the kingdom of Israel was prosperous and flourishing. King David"],["701.76","with the power of God had brought military victory and built a strong nation. King Solomon his son with the"],["709.12","wisdom of God had made the nation prosperous, wealthy beyond compare. He built a glorious temple that was"],["716.079","overlaid with gold. And people from every nation would travel to Israel to marvel at its riches and splendor. But"],["722.56","all that was destroyed in 580 BC when the Babylonians disassembled that temple and they tore down the city of"],["728.88","Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the Old Testament prophets foretold of a son of David, the Messiah, who would rise up"],["736.639","and restore, reassemble the kingdom of Israel. He would sit on his Dave, father David's"],["743.519","throne, and he would rule the whole world. And this is what the disciples had in mind when they signed up to"],["749.92","follow Jesus. They believed he was the Messiah. They believed he was going to restore the kingdom of Israel, reclaim"],["756.079","their sovereignty and independence. And when he did, they would be rich rulers"],["763.2","in a restored kingdom. That's what they had in mind. Those were their plans,"],["771.279","but they're about to learn through the Acts of the Apostles that their plans are not God's plans. You got"],["779.76","any plans? What do you have in mind? What do you want to do with your life? You know,"],["785.6","some young people, you know, maybe they're here and they love sports and they're thinking, you know, well, maybe I could get a college scholarship"],["792.16","playing baseball and and then I could go pro and then I could sign on with the Blue Jays and beat the Yankees and go on"],["798.88","to the World Series. No amens on that."],["804.32","I mean, you knew I was going to talk about the Blue Jays at some point, right? Some people are in here and they're and"],["810.399","they're in school and they're working on their education. and they're thinking, well, I'm planning to go into this field and I'm going to get a career when I'm"],["815.76","done my studies and I'm going to rise up in that industry. I'm going to make really good money. And some people here, what they have in mind is like, you"],["821.519","know, I'm going to fall in love and I'm going to start a family. I'm just going to be so happy raising my kids. Well,"],["827.6","everybody has something in mind. So did the disciples. We expect to be rulers in"],["833.12","the messianic kingdom. Lord, when will you do that? Have you ever considered"],["839.12","that maybe your big plans are not God's plans for your life? The disciples had"],["845.519","not considered that Jesus had a different plan. Lord, when will you restore the kingdom? And Jesus said,"],["851.92","\"It's not for you to know when the kingdom is going to be restored.\""],["857.92","Lots of people think they know when Jesus is coming back. I I missed all the"],["863.68","fun in Spain because there was all these predictions last month that maybe that was going to be the rapture. It's going"],["871.04","to be in September. Either that or we all missed it cuz I don't know. But anyways, didn't happen. Well, now well"],["876.8","maybe it's maybe it's this month. Maybe it's the end of October. Personally, I think that would be great. I'd love for Jesus to come back. I think it will be"],["883.76","soon. But just as the disciples, the people who went on the internet uh and"],["889.76","said the rapture is going to happen last month, they learned the hard way what it says here, we do not know when"],["897.36","the time will be. However, there are specific things that we do know that God wants us to perform. Verse number eight,"],["905.279","he says you, it's not for you to know the time, but you will receive power"],["910.88","when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the"],["917.519","ends of the earth. We have been given a specific task to be"],["923.199","what? Witnesses. The Greek word for witness is, you know,"],["929.6","martyr. Martyr. It originally meant in the Greek someone who gives a testimony"],["935.68","of what they saw. Maybe they go to court and they go on record telling being a witness. Now for us, the word martyr"],["942.959","means someone who's killed for their convictions. That's not"],["948.079","what the Greek word originally meant, but it's what the word became to mean. Why? Why does it get used like that now?"],["956.959","Because when all the disciples went out to be witnesses of Jesus, what happened"],["962.48","to all them except John the beloved? They were all killed. They were all put to death because of their testimony."],["970.24","That was God's plan for his disciples. What a horrible plan. Why would anyone"],["978.639","sign up to be a disciple? Why did Jesus want his disciples to be"],["984.56","killed? It's not that Jesus wanted his disciples or any of us to be killed. Matter of"],["991.12","fact, God is not willing that any should perish."],["996.959","So much so that he made a way to save us from perishing. For God so loved the"],["1003.759","world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not"],["1009.68","perish but have everlasting life. God doesn't want anyone to perish. But people have a free will. And if people"],["1016.959","choose to kill others because of hate, because they reject the will of God, then people perish. When people want to"],["1024.559","remain in their sins and reject the gospel message that the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, if they reject that gift, then"],["1031.52","they will perish. But since God doesn't want them to perish, he wants them to"],["1036.559","hear the good news, to receive the gift of eternal life. He instructs his disciples to take the message out to the"],["1043.919","whole world so that everyone can hear that Christ died for our sins and that he was buried and that he rose again and"],["1051.919","whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. That's God's plan."],["1059.039","That is what he wants each and every one of us to be about. Just as he told his disciples, the great commission here"],["1065.679","applies to all of us. We are to be witnesses taking that message of Jesus"],["1071.12","to the uttermost parts of the earth. Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, uttermost"],["1077.919","parts of the earth. And that's what we've been trying to do. That's what I personally been trying to do for the past 33 years. 1992. I said to the Lord"],["1085.36","or look, I really don't know what I'm doing with my life here. Uh it's just kind of a mess. So, you take over and I"],["1092","will do what you want me to do. And since then, I've been trying to follow these instructions. And and the first"],["1098.88","thing he did was he took me to the hometown that I was born in Toronto, Nova Scotia. And he took me there to"],["1105.44","serve as a youth pastor trying to reach teenagers with the gospel, plus shoot"],["1111.6","them with paintballs and play basketball and take them skiing and all kinds of fun things with teens. But then they got"],["1116.799","I got I got promoted into more of a assistant pastor role and and serve in the church and learn to do a little"],["1123.52","more. And uh then he took me from and that would have been my Jerusalem, you"],["1129.36","know, where I was from. And then he took me to uh a part of Canada where I had"],["1135.12","grown up, uh New Brunswick, and that would have been my Judea. And I was pastoring a church there, trying to help"],["1141.12","those people and reach them likewise with the gospel. And then he took me right across the border to the United"],["1146.799","States of America and uh different country, different people but neighbors, you know, kind of similar to Canadians"],["1152.88","kind of. Uh and now in America, this would be my Samaria. And as the pastor"],["1159.44","of Faith Bible Church, when Elelliana and I first came to Faith Bible Church 18 years ago, this church was was very"],["1166.16","small. It's like 150 people here. Now the interesting thing about the members"],["1171.44","of faith bible church is you people are true to the name of the church faith"],["1178.32","bible you believe that practicing your faith is doing what the bible says so we"],["1185.84","have been striving to follow Jesus commandment here in verse number eight we've been making disciples for the last"],["1193.36","18 years and the church has been growing and because of this faith bible church,"],["1198.799","which 18 years ago had a missions budget of about $25,000. Today, we do well over"],["1204.32","$200,000 to missions and to ministries that are witnesses of Jesus Christ. And"],["1212","we have missionaries all over. Praise the Lord for that. We have missionaries all over the world that we're trying to"],["1217.6","support. And on top of that, every year we have a portion of people here that go out to do some short-term missions"],["1224.64","trips. And this past year, we had people go to the Dominican Republic and go to Panama and go back to the Dominican"],["1230.159","Republic and go back again. I don't know, Mark, everybody likes the DR. You started something there. We've had folks"],["1235.28","go to Africa. We had 50 people go to Kentucky because, you know, that's just a place that needs revival, right? And"],["1240.96","we sent people out to Kentucky. And I a year ago, we were we were asked by our"],["1246.24","missionaries in Spain, could we come over there for a month, preach at their church, and help at a uh their"],["1252.24","ministries? And one of their ministries is a refugee center that they support. And originally we thought, well, this"],["1258.08","would be good because Illiana could provide some counseling services for the refugees who've experienced a lot of trauma. And she has been trained in in"],["1264.96","in trauma counseling. And there were a lot of Ukrainians fleeing the war, their"],["1270.08","war torn country. A lot of Ukrainians were dumped into Spain. And these classes were full. Um, but once we got"],["1276.88","there, they they didn't really need the they didn't ask for the trauma counseling. what they really needed was"],["1282.08","a Spanish teacher because uh they didn't have anybody to teach Spanish uh that week. And in Spain,"],["1289.84","uh they will not permit you to advance in the immigration process until you can"],["1294.88","speak the language, which is Spanish. Imagine that. Requiring people to learn"],["1301.679","the language of the culture that you're attempting to assimilate into. What a concept. So the demand for the Spanish"],["1308.4","classes gives the center an excellent opportunity to interface with the people who are needy and to minister to them."],["1315.679","So they didn't charge them for these Spanish classes. They just all show up. And uh in the Spanish classes, Illana"],["1321.6","was able to weave into her lessons Christian values. Uh she taught them how"],["1326.72","to pray in Spanish. She teaching the uh colors in in Spanish. She used the"],["1332.64","wordless book. So she went through the wordless book to teach them colors and teach them the gospel while she was"],["1338.24","going through the colors. Uh so she was very effective in connecting with these people. I was much less effective than"],["1345.28","her. Uh no compren no ablan there. I just gave you all my"],["1351.12","Spanish. When I say I'm familiar with Spanish, it means I know the word taco."],["1359.84","But I got to uh serve lunch and I washed dishes and I went grocery shopping and I set clothes out that were donated for"],["1366.4","the people and I assembled chairs that the students could sit on and I cleaned the tables afterwards and I did all this"],["1372.159","behindthescenes ministry but that was needed to help support the program. And"],["1377.84","there's are many aspects to ministry that make the proclamation of the gospel effective. We do that here, right? Our"],["1385.12","video ministry, it it goes out to the whole world. Matter of fact, people in Spain were telling me, \"Oh, yeah, we've"],["1390.159","been we were doing your study and we were following along with your teaching at Faith Bible Church.\" But that doesn't"],["1395.6","happen if there's not somebody behind the scenes going to run the camera. People can hear the preaching so much"],["1402.96","better when all the beautiful little toddlers and children are not crying and"],["1409.6","laughing in the service. You know, some Sundays we got 25 kids down there in the nursery. And if they were all in here,"],["1416.799","probably be hard to hear what was going on. So these behind the scenes ministry"],["1422","help make disciples. So whether you're up front preaching or you're behind the scenes assisting, whether you go on a"],["1428.48","missions trip or whether you are donating money with the churros and chocolate last week, which I heard was great, but I didn't get any churo or"],["1434.88","chocolate, so I'm a little salty about that. But if you donated money at that for someone to go on the trip, we all"],["1442.64","have a part to play in fulfilling the commandment of Jesus. Go and be witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,"],["1451.279","and the ends of the earth. And we were able to witness to people from the ends"],["1457.679","of the earth in Spain because at the center there were people from Morocco and Ukraine, Brazil, Iraq, Nigeria."],["1466","There was people, there was a gal from China and for a few days we actually were able to take this little side trip"],["1472.48","to Tangier, Morocco and while in Morocco we were seeing the country. We had this young fella who was driving us around"],["1478.48","for the afternoon and over the course of that trip we got to talk to him about Jesus. So that's what we did the whole"],["1485.279","month of September trying to be witnesses for Jesus to all the people that we came in contact with in all the"],["1491.76","different countries we got to see. That's God's plan for all of the followers of Jesus. All who claim to be"],["1498.08","a friend of God. Jesus followers ask about the kingdom. And Jesus said, \"It's not for you to know that. Focus on being"],["1505.039","a witness.\" Are you focused on God's plans"],["1510.24","or like the disciples? Are you thinking about your own plans? You shall be my witnesses. Jerusalem,"],["1516.48","Judea, Samaria, the ends of the earth. That is the commandment. That is the"],["1521.76","purpose statement. the mission statement that we followers of Jesus are still to"],["1526.799","follow. Nothing has changed. However, that doesn't mean that the messiac messianic kingdom is not coming. Look at"],["1533.84","the next thing that happens here. This is so interesting. Verse number nine. While he had spoken these things, while"],["1539.679","they watched, he was taken up and a cloud received him out of sight. And while they were looking steadfastly"],["1546.159","towards heaven, as he went up, two men stood by them in white apparel. So we"],["1552.559","say, yeah, those are angels, right? Angels stood there and they said, \"Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up"],["1558.64","into heaven, the same Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will so come in like manner as you saw him go up"],["1565.679","to heaven.\" So, I heard last month that uh since people thought the rapture was"],["1570.799","coming that some people quit their jobs and some people had stopped paying their bills and uh I I I heard this story that"],["1578.159","one neighbor asked their their neighbor uh would you take care of my dog when I'm raptured next month? It's like what"],["1584.96","do you mean like I'm not going to heaven? It's just you. Yeah, that was kind of salty. But um I"],["1590.799","think the angel's instructions to the disciples is still relevant for people today. We're not supposed to be standing"],["1597.84","around gazing up into heaven. That's not the proper life application of the prophetic information that Jesus is"],["1604.64","coming back. I think it is human nature to you know"],["1609.679","complicate things. You remember the Pharisees? They were a prime example of this in their earnest attempts to follow"],["1615.52","the laws of Moses. They they made some instruction manuals. They devised some policies and procedures. They formulated"],["1622.799","governance and it did not help anyone follow the Lord. All it did was lead"],["1628.96","them away. Jesus says, \"Woe to you scribes and Pharisees. You you put burdens around people's necks. You do"],["1635.039","you shut the kingdom of heaven. You don't enter and you don't let anybody else enter.\" It's just a It was just a bunch of when"],["1641.919","Jesus showed up on the scene, it was just a bunch of standing around gazing at religious activities, but no actual"],["1648.96","obedience was being accomplished. And we too can get wrapped up in talking about"],["1654","spirituality and discussing ministries and studying the subject matter and reading books and taking classes and a"],["1661.36","lot of philosophy about following Jesus. But it can turn into a lot of standing"],["1666.72","around gazing up into heaven and not actually being witnesses. And at"],["1673.039","some point we need to reach out to people who don't know Jesus and communicate the message to them. You"],["1679.6","know, many times we're praying, you know, God, what do you want me to do? You know, where do you want me to go to school? What should I do for work? Or"],["1685.679","what state should I move into? Should I ask this girl out? You know, what investment should I put in? What church should I go to? And we distract"],["1692.24","ourselves with our plans. But the clear instructions are be my"],["1698.96","witnesses. We talk to God about ourselves and sure we can. You know, he's available. He listens because he"],["1704.159","loves us. But at some point, we need to just get at doing what we know we're supposed to be doing. Make disciples."],["1710.64","Share the good news so that when he does return, you're not standing around doing nothing, but he finds you faithfully"],["1718.48","busy, not idle. Well, I believe Jesus is coming back. And I believe he's coming"],["1724.159","soon. And I believe we're supposed to watch and be ready because that's what scripture said. But the gospel is not"],["1730.88","the rapture is coming soon. The gospel is not Jesus is going to judge all the"],["1736.559","evil empires of the world.

It's"],["26.64","like rubbing it in. While we were in Spain, we did a lot of walking through the city of Malaga, and every morning we"],["32.8","took the same route to the immigration center where Elelliana was teaching Spanish to the refugees. The first time"],["39.28","we walked to the center, we were concentrating hard on, you know, the Google Maps instructions. Where did my"],["44.719","phone go? I thought it was here. Anybody see my phone? Oh well. Anyways, uh we"],["50.399","were using the Google map instructions, trying to find the proper se streets, you know, not getting lost. But once"],["57.039","you've walked a particular route a time or two, you no longer need that map. And uh that's when you can kind of look"],["64.4","around at your surroundings and make some observations. I noticed that this particular business,"],["71.76","this same woman came out every morning right at the time we were walking by and she would sweep the sidewalk and uh"],["78.72","clean up and pick up all the trash around the business. And I thought, I like that. You know, they they have such"],["84.32","an attention to detail. They even want the street outside of their establishment to be clean, which means"],["91.52","this lady was cleaning up other people's messes, cigarette butts that people had"],["96.799","thrown there. Uh, man, they smoke a lot in Europe. I'm just saying it was smoke"],["102","break all the time. And, you know, trash that would blow uh, you know, from the night before. None of it was that"],["108.479","business's trash. Certainly not that lady's trash, but nevertheless, she came out every morning to clean up someone"],["115.2","else's mess. And I noticed that phenomena at different businesses. People would come out in the morning and"],["120.479","they would they would kind of hose down and sweep up in front of the front of the business. But I also noticed that"],["126.079","other businesses did not do that and there would be trash outside and they just you had to step over it. They did"],["132.56","not even bother a bit with it. Uh after all, you know, the sidewalk is not or the street is not theirs. They don't own"],["139.2","that. So why would they pick it up? It's someone else's mess. Have you ever had"],["144.879","to clean someone else's mess? Why would you do that? You know, my dad"],["151.76","um by the way, I want to say this about my father. Uh he has retired in 2021 and"],["159.12","just been in the community and uh up there in Woodstock, New Brunswick, Carlton County. He's been 60 years now a"],["165.519","minister in that area. and uh he told me this past week a a church in that town"],["171.599","called him and said could you come in and resume ministry here uh we don't have anybody and uh he prayed about it"],["178.64","and he said yes and so today was his first Sunday at St. James United Church in Woodstock, New Brunswick. And he"],["184.56","said, \"I'm a little nervous.\" And I said, \"Well, you know, you at half speed is better than most up there.\" So, you"],["190.159","know, we praying for him. So, pray for Pastor Bob as he uh he once again resumes uh ministering the gospel there."],["196.48","But, you know, Pastor Bob, I'll tell you a Pastor Bob story. Um he loves to get out and cut grass. And"],["203.04","in the winter, he loves blowing snow. Maybe he doesn't love it, but he just he has to. He's obsessive. So he'll get out"],["209.76","there and cut his grass and then he looks at the street where he lives and"],["214.879","if he sees somebody else's yard is untidy, he'll go over and he'll cut their grass, too. And uh just he's"],["222.239","obsessive guy. Just wants everything to look a certain way. So when he drives"],["227.519","down the street, all the grass is neat and tidy on the whole street. And uh lo"],["235.04","and behold, as he's done this, he gets to meet neighbors who he's cutting the grass for. It's kind of awkward. Here's"],["240.879","here's Bob out here cutting the grass, you know, they go out. And lo and behold, he has found that many times people are sick or they're just kind of"],["247.36","weak. They're recovering from something or they just got old and they can't do it for themselves anymore. And uh it"],["252.64","opens up a door for him to minister to them and share the gospel. So by working on their yards, he's been able to also"],["259.759","work on their souls and uh the street you conduct business on, the community"],["265.199","you live in. How do you want it to look? Now, some people can ignore it and and"],["270.24","they they they feel that you know that that's fine, but other people can't function. They can't concentrate when"],["277.52","there's so much mess in order to move forward and get anything accomplished. They're like, \"First, I need to clean up"],["283.84","this mess.\" Well, that's what I see happening here in Acts 1. And I promise"],["290.4","we are going to finish this chapter and move on. But Acts 1 verse number 15"],["295.84","through 22. Let's read this and see if you can see what I'm getting at. So verse number 15. In those days Peter"],["302.56","stood up in the midst of the disciples altogether. The number of the names was about 120 and said, \"Men and brethren,"],["311.36","this scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas.\""],["319.36","Oh, something in scripture about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus, for he was numbered with us and"],["328.08","obtained part of this ministry. Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong he burst"],["335.919","open in the midst and his entrils gushed out. It's very appropriate for ghoulish"],["342.24","Halloween, right? We can talk about guts rushing out. And it became known to those dwelling in Jerusalem. So the"],["348.08","field is called in their own language achiema"],["354.56","that is field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, \"Let his dwelling place be desolate, and let no"],["361.44","one live in it, and let another take his office.\""],["367.44","Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"],["373.68","beginning with the ba with the from the baptism of John to that day when he was taken up from us, one of these must"],["380.4","become a witness with us of his resurrection. Let's stop right there. Last week we saw"],["386.88","the disciples were following Jesus instructions which we saw in verse number four this chapter which was to do"],["393.68","not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father and Luke gives"],["398.8","the roll call of the disciples and we uh went through their names and we observed that they were all in one accord while"],["405.28","waiting for the promise of the father which was the baptism of the holy spirit. How long did that take? Just out"],["411.68","of curiosity. How long did they have to wait in Jerusalem? It was actually 10"],["416.88","days. Uh there how do I know that? Because there's 50 days between the"],["422.16","Jewish festival of first fruits where Jesus rose from the dead and the 50 days"],["428.8","between that and the Jewish celebration of Pentecost. And we know the Holy Spirit comes on Pentecost. So Jesus was"],["435.84","with his disciples according to uh Luke 40 days after he rose from the dead"],["442.08","before he was ascended up into heaven. So he told them wait in Jerusalem till the promise comes. He was within 40"],["447.919","days. It means there's 10 days left. So those are interesting numbers by the"],["453.12","way. Do do you recognize the number 40 and the number of 10? You know where where do we see 40? Remember the"],["459.68","Israelites wandered for 40 years in the wilderness and Jesus spent 40 days"],["465.36","fasting in the wilderness and it's always affiliated with the number of a"],["470.88","time of testing. Uh likewise the number 10 they had to wait 10 days in Jerusalem"],["477.599","and 10 symbolizes you recognize 10 from original scripture 10 commandments maybe"],["485.039","the 10 plagues right so 10 symbolizes completeness divine order human responsibility so you can think of 10 as"],["493.68","a divine reset point a moment where God completes a cycle and invites a response"],["500.56","so in those 10 days of waiting The disciples are going to take care of a little business. They're using this time"],["506.72","to reset, regroup, and replace Judas."],["512","Judas betrayal clearly had an impact on the whole group. He made a big what? He"],["518.88","made a big mess for the group, also for himself. Judas made such a mess, he"],["524","broke his own spirit and his own will to live. And instead of trying to find any way to clean up his mess, make amends"],["531.44","with the group, ask for forgiveness from from Jesus, he goes out and what did he do? He hung himself. And uh we see this"],["540.08","account here briefly, but it tells it in more detail in Matthew chap 27. I'll read that for you. Uh Judas, his"],["547.279","betrayer, seeing that he had been condemned, was remorseful, brought back the 30 pieces of silver to the chief"],["553.44","priests and elders, threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, went out and hanged himself."],["560","But the chief priest took the silver and said, \"Well, this is not lawful for us to put it back in the treasury cuz it's the price of blood.\" And they consulted"],["567.04","together, bought with it a potter's field to bury strangers. Therefore, that"],["573.12","field was called the field of blood. And then we get a little more of the story here in Acts where that was the field"],["578.72","that he hung himself and fell and split his guts all open and it became called the field of blood. But there is more to"],["585.2","the mess than just his guts spilling in the field. There is broken unity. The"],["591.279","offense of the friends, the disciples, the followers of Jesus, and their reputation as a group. It's a big mess."],["599.92","How do they make sense of this? I think this is a scenario that many can"],["604.959","relate to. We know there are people in here who are feeling the pain of broken"],["611.12","relationships, very messy situations because of hurt and offense and even"],["617.04","feeling betrayed. Someone did something to you and it's just made a big mess for"],["622.079","you. Do you wallow in it or do you clean it up? It seems unjust that we have this"],["630","responsibility thrust upon us. Where would we even start? How do we make sense of it? Well, what I saw here is"],["637.2","Peter turns the group's attention to the word of the Lord. Look at verse number"],["642.8","16. So Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, verse 15, and he said, \"Men and brethren, this scripture has"],["650.48","been fulfilled that the Holy Spirit spoke from the mouth of David concerning Judas.\""],["656.72","And then verse number 20, he quotes the scripture. It's written in the book of Psalms, \"Let his dwelling be desolate."],["662.88","Let no one live in it, and let another take his office.\""],["668.16","So, Peter's quoting the Old Testament, and we're going to check out these passages from the Psalms in just a"],["673.6","moment. But I wanted I did not want to miss the opportunity to stress the importance of finding the answers to all"],["680.56","of life's challenges in the word of God. We live in a world,"],["686.48","we are living in a time when our culture is fragmented. And people can hear about"],["693.12","everything, but they can discern nothing. A gale force wind of information is"],["700.079","hitting us. Do we have any objective standard of truth that will anchor us?"],["705.76","Many people do not. Consequently, when the storm of life crashes down on them,"],["711.04","when chaos and conflict assaults them, they have feelings. They have all these opinions and all these emotions of fear"],["717.519","and anger. But where can they go to find the right answer? Where can they go for the truth? Is your iPhone algorithm that"],["726.079","is designed to keep you addicted to spending time on your phone going to provide you the answers?"],["732","I think it's just going to serve another round of emotional opinions laced with political talking points but void of any"],["738.079","context to keep you engaged in your echo chamber echo chamber and addicted to its contents."],["744.959","People have subjective emotional reactions, but those are not solid foundations to base important life"],["750.959","decisions upon. Our fragment culture is offering you sand to build your life on."],["757.76","Sand that sifts with the storms. And Peter appoints everyone to the objective"],["763.839","truth of God's word. Something to be anchored to that will hold when the storms blow. A rock that will not shift."],["771.12","How firm a foundation you saints of the Lord is laid in this most excellent"],["777.12","word. Remember that song we used to sing that one. You have to decide when the storms of"],["784.079","life blow. What will be your foundation? Will it be the fragment opinions of"],["789.92","society fed to you by an AI algorithm? Or will it be the word of the Lord, the"],["796.32","objective standard of truth? If you say, \"Well, it's going to be the word of the Lord.\" then probably you should spend"],["802","more time paying attention to it as opposed to what the echo chamber screams"],["807.92","on your phone. Meaning you need to put the phone down and you need to get into"],["813.12","that. Now I just made some of you very defensive because the idea of what"],["818.959","stepping away from something that you might be addicted to is going to incite an emotional reaction. It it may be"],["825.92","upsetting that I would call that out. Be that as it may, I have a duty to warn you. If your phone influences your"],["833.12","worldview more than the word of God, you're on shifting stand. If your modern-day PC curated opinions"],["841.199","contradict God's word, you're going to fall for deception. Peter turns to the"],["846.56","word of the Lord to find proper perspective on how to think and feel about the betrayal of Judas. This"],["854.079","scripture had to be fulfilled. Peter says this horrible thing that the group is experiencing, this mess that we now"],["860.32","got to clean up, Judas's mess, it's a fulfillment of prophecy."],["865.76","Really, look at this verse. Psalms 41:9. Even my own familiar friend whom I"],["872.88","trusted in, who I ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me. Well,"],["878.24","that just sounds like on face value David is lamenting about some injustice he's experiencing."],["884.48","But in hindsight, it's so much more. David had his own countrymen who he"],["889.68","fought to liberate from the Philistine oppression turn on him. His own father-in-law tossed javelins at him."],["896.72","His own son betrayed him and tried to take his throne. David was a man who"],["902.959","knew about betrayal and wrote psalms crying out to God for help. And in doing"],["908.16","so, in those psalms, David expressed emotions that all of us feel at some"],["913.519","point in our lives. And under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, David described the very scenario that Jesus"],["919.839","would endure the detail about the bread. Even my own familiar friend whom I"],["925.12","trusted who ate my bread. Remember when it was the soop of bread that Jesus used"],["930.8","to identify his betrayer? He said, \"Someone's going to betray me.\" John asked him, \"Who's it going to be,"],["936.8","Lord?\" And Jesus said, \"It's going to be who I give this bread dipped in wine to.\" And he dipped it and he gave it to"],["944.8","gave it to Judas. Like David, like Jesus, you too"],["953.04","have had people betray your trust. They've hurt you. They've wounded you. It's created a big mess for you. We see"],["960.24","it all around from our personal relationships to the mess on the national scale."],["967.279","Everything in this world is one big mess. But Peter's words ring true to all of"],["974.639","us. The scriptures had to be fulfilled."],["979.759","All this injustice, unrighteousness, brokenness, is it not to be expected?"],["988.079","Things are exactly as the word of the Lord describes them. Since the fall of mankind, when sin and death entered the"],["994.32","world, all have been put under a curse. Fear, hatred, greed, envy, pride,"],["1000.8","selfishness, lies. This is in the hearts of all people from the greatest to the"],["1006.959","least. The empires, the kingdoms of men are corrupt. And this leads to all this poverty and shame. Everything happening"],["1013.92","in the world today is exactly as Peter says, a fulfillment of prophecy."],["1020.079","It could be no other way. Likewise, what you're feeling and experiencing on a personal level is a"],["1026.079","fulfillment of what God's word tells us is going on in the universal level. And once you get redpilled, you start to see"],["1034.319","the reality of the world we live in. That's when you can start making sense of it all. But many people are suffering"],["1041.679","with what is called cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is a psychological theory that describes the"],["1048.4","mental dis comfort we feel when we hold two or more conflicting beliefs, values or attitudes or when our behaviors"],["1055.36","contradict our beliefs. On the one hand, people want to believe that themselves"],["1060.88","and the people around them are generally good people. And since they're"],["1066.799","good, life should be good. Pain is avoidable and bad things aren't supposed"],["1072.08","to happen. And yet reality is the opposite of their beliefs. They're"],["1078.08","living in a big mess. And it's shocking to them. Why all this pain and suffering? Why are things so bad? I"],["1083.919","don't understand. We have all these really smart scientists. We got all these people winning these Nobel Peace Prizes and all these Noble people."],["1090.16","They're they're being paid lots of money. Why can't they fix this? Why isn't this mess getting cleaned up?"],["1097.6","People believe they deserve better. They deserve good things, a good life, a good environment, completely in denial of"],["1104.48","reality. The reality that everyone is sick and dying. Everyone is under the curse. As"],["1111.679","the prophet says in Isaiah 64, we are all an unclean thing. And all of our"],["1118.72","righteousness, it's just filthy rags. And we all fade as a leaf. and our"],["1124","iniquity is like the wind. It's just takes us away. And then Paul reinforces that in Romans 3:23 where he says"],["1132.16","you people but not me. No, he says all all have sinned and fallen short of the"],["1137.84","glory of God. So just like Peter, the word of the Lord makes sense of what we are experiencing. Your pain, this mess"],["1144.88","is a fulfillment of prophecy. And just as the word of the Lord helps us make sense of why things are so bad, it also"],["1151.6","tells us what we are supposed to do about it. And that's the part you need."],["1156.64","However, I don't know if you're going to like my answer, but I'm going to give it to you regardless. Three steps and how"],["1161.919","to deal with the mess. Ready? Step one, write it down. Here we go. Step one is"],["1169.039","you need to let God deal with injustice. You need to let God deal with injustice."],["1176.16","Let's look at the Psalms that Peter quotes. Psalm 69. Turn over to Psalms"],["1181.2","69. Verse 19. I want to read a little bit more of it for context, not just the"],["1187.84","verse itself. So, let's pick it up in verse 19. You might recognize this when I start to"],["1194.24","read it. The psalmist writes verse 19, \"You know my reproach, my shame, and my"],["1200.4","dishonor. My adversaries are all before you. Reproach has broken my heart. I am"],["1206.4","full of heaviness. I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none. For comforters, but I found none. They also"],["1212.96","gave me g for my food, and for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink. Oo, what is this? Recognize that one?"],["1221.44","That's Jesus on the cross. This is messianic prophecy. Let their table become a snare before"],["1229.039","them. Let their well-being a trap.

Also the descendants of his servant shall inherit it. Those who love"],["1285.36","his name shall dwell in. Now turn to Psalms 109. Same"],["1292.559","same thing. We want to read a little bit of what Peter is quoting for context."],["1298.08","Picking it up at the beginning of the psalm. David writes,"],["1304.32","\"Do not keep silent, oh God, of my praise.

He's not scheming of a way to get even with these people. He's not holding on to the"],["1415.84","bitterness or the resentment. Nor is he living in denial saying it's fine, it's good, whatever. No, he's telling the"],["1421.919","truth about all that he's experiencing, how it's making him feel, but can you spot the pattern? What is the pattern of"],["1427.36","the psalms?

No one live in their"],["1751.2","tents. That was Judas's fate.

We have here uh"],["1785.279","we have 11, we need 12. Uh let another take his place. As I said earlier, there"],["1791.12","was more to the mess than Judah's bloody guts. There was the broken unity. The disciples feel incomplete. Something"],["1798.08","Jesus had instituted has been severed. There was 12 disciples in scripture."],["1803.919","There's another number for us. We recognize that number, right? 12 symbolizes divine authority,"],["1808.96","completeness, governmental foundations, and appears over 180 times in the Bible.

Some people don't do so well moving on"],["1846.24","from the betrayal that they've experienced. It becomes a a great excuse"],["1852","for every unwise decision they make for the rest of their life.

And this tells me that after this, everybody moves on."],["1901.44","They replace him and they got back to the business of following Jesus' commands."],["1907.6","Same's true for many of us here today. Cleaning up the mess is putting the old"],["1913.44","away and getting involved in something new like maybe a new job or a new"],["1919.44","relationship or some of you a new church, some of you a new ministry"],["1924.96","opportunity that you can get into. You know, when we first left Canada, we moved to the United States. I talked a"],["1930.64","lot about with people my the the painful situation that happened in that church"],["1936.24","that I used to pastor that that kind of motiv that was like one of the things that motivated us to leave.

But, you know, I don't talk about"],["1954.08","it anymore. I rarely ever speak about that time. I I now only bring up the situation when I use it to relate to"],["1961.84","someone who is going through a painful time as a way to assure them you'll"],["1967.519","survive this betrayal and you will move on and you can thrive. I see now that God had a plan in that"],["1975.84","time and I played my part and the mess got cleaned up and God's word came true and now 18 years later I'm blessed and"],["1982.32","we're working on year 19 being down here with you all. So it's wonderful. You know when you've forgiven and you've"],["1989.279","moved on when the sight of and the mention of"],["1994.799","that person no longer hurts you. You don't have to retell all that bad"],["2000.24","history. uh Tom Foxworthy. Uh he did this to me one time. 400 time I've told"],["2006.72","that story, right? And you know, you can finally close the book and you can talk about Tom and say, \"Yeah, Tom, he's"],["2013.279","great man of the faith. Love him.\" Verse 21."],["2022.159","We'll close with this. Therefore, of these two men who have accompanied us all the time that the"],["2028.88","Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John to the day when he was taken up from us,"],["2036.32","one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection. Okay, we got two guys. Who are they? Well, there's Joseph"],["2043.279","and u called Baradas who was surname Justice. So, he's got"],["2049.839","three names. That's confusing. and Matias. And they prayed and said, \"Oh Lord, who"],["2057.04","knows the hearts of all, show which of these two you have chosen to take part in this ministry and apostilhip from"],["2063.919","which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place"],["2069.52","and they cast their lots and the lot fell on Matias and he was numbered with the 11 apostles.\" Okay, let's close with"],["2076.96","this. This is a very interesting detail. Even though these two guys are not part of the 12, they had been following Jesus"],["2083.679","according to Peter from when? The time of Jesus' baptism till the time"],["2088.72","he went up. So according to verse 15, we read that this group, you know,"],["2094.24","because we always think of Jesus and the 12, right? Jesus and the 12. But according to verse 15, how many people were there?"],["2099.839","Like 120 people, right? And and this shows us that there were many people"],["2104.96","around Jesus all the years of his ministry. There was a congregation. And"],["2110","now the congregation begins to function in a new capacity. Not simply people"],["2115.68","walking along listening to Jesus. What you know standing around. Oh, Jesus is going to do something cool. Let's wait"],["2121.28","for Jesus to do some do a miracle. No, now they are beginning to participate to"],["2127.44","take an active role. Since Jesus is no longer there to appoint someone, the disciples use a criteria to determine"],["2134.48","who should be considered. Someone who's been with them from the beginning. And then they cast lots believing that God"],["2139.599","will direct the lot to fall on the person who he deems best. Now today, to a certain extent, we do the same"],["2145.92","tradition when it comes to appointing church leaders. We look at a person's track record in life and ministry and"],["2152.24","then we pray about it and we ask God, you know, to guide us and then we we cast lots. we take a vote and uh members"],["2158.96","of FA Faith Bible Church, you will have an opportunity to participate in this ancient tradition in just a few weeks at"],["2165.04","our annual meeting.

No, don't you don't have to walk in with it. We got the rolls. We know who's on them. Uh you"],["2177.92","have the opportunity to vote on some new deacons, some new leaders, and you get to vote on the budget. It's always fun."],["2184.72","So, show up for that. uh if you're a member, you get to you're"],["2190","part of the congregation, you get to do these things. And we also have gifts and talents that we use to actively serve"],["2196.32","the congregation. So the first acts of the apostles, clean"],["2201.92","up Judas mess, move forward in one accord as a"],["2207.04","congregation. And we too, we have to clean up other people's messes. And we"],["2213.04","got three steps. What are they? trusting in God to deal with the injustice."],["2219.52","Our part is to forget. Oh, you got that one good. That was that was the key.
