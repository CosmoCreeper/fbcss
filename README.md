# The FBC Sermon Search
PATENT PENDING.\
*DELAY: Project is being polished, but due to commercial delays, the program will not be announced yet.*

**What is the Sermon Search?**: The Sermon Search is a program that allows you to search through all of the sermons from Faith Bible Church that were also posted on YouTube and have a transcript.

**What are some use cases?**: Let's say you have a friend that doesn't go to church, but you want to show him something your pastor said. Or maybe you have a question and want to know what your pastor said about it. You can "Sermon Search" and find exactly where he said it.

**Can you filter results?**: Absolutely! You can filter by date, book of the Bible, and pastors. You can even sort results by new, old, and top (video with the most results of keyword).

**What are the prerequisites?**: There are none, except for a device and maybe a web browser. Just go to "https://cosmocreeper.github.io/fbcss/".
