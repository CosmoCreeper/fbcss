Samuel chapter 31 I "],["25.509","know you thought we were done it but "],["27.46","there's one more important lesson to be "],["29.859","learned and we will read starting at "],["32.98","verse number eight to the final verse 13 "],["38.07","it came about the next day when the "],["40.48","Philistines came to strip the slain they "],["43.42","found Saul and his three sons fallen on "],["46.42","mount cavora they cut off his head "],["48.48","stripped off his weapons and sent them "],["51.25","throughout the land of the Philistines "],["52.329","to carry the good news to the house of "],["55.39","their idols into the people they put his "],["59.109","weapons in the temple of Astaroth and "],["61.3","they fastened his body on the wall of "],["63.82","bhishen now when the inhabitants of "],["67.33","jabish Gilead heard what the philistines "],["70.149","had done to solve all the valiant men "],["73.03","rose and walked all nights took the body "],["76.899","of Saul and the bodies of his son from "],["78.909","the walls of us and they came to Jay "],["81.19","Bosch and buried them there they took "],["83.56","their bones and buried them under a "],["85.149","tamarisk tree and jay-bez and fasted "],["87.94","seven days I want you to take a moment "],["91.539","and think about the day that you were at "],["94","your best whatever it is you consider "],["96.88","you were excitable being your best at "],["98.89","that moment in time when you were "],["100.959","shining and you were doing your very "],["104.38","best that think about for a while and "],["107.349","what I want to talk about on that "],["108.34","illustration and I thought of May in "],["111.629","2007 I graduated from Capitol Bible "],["114.91","seminary and I received my diploma for "],["119.349","my Master of Divinity that day also on "],["123.19","that Saturday I received the Charles B "],["126.52","Han shoe preaching award and that was a "],["129.729","competition that took place every year "],["131.53","at the seminary the guys in seminary "],["134.019","would do a preaching series and we would "],["136.36","all preach before all the staff and all "],["138.76","the faculty and all the students of "],["140.349","Capitol in Washington Bible College and "],["142.03","then they would announce it at "],["144.28","graduation who had won that award so I "],["147.16","received that award on that "],["149.56","day and then also I received that day "],["154.53","salutatorian award for second highest "],["157.36","grades in the class so yes quite "],["160.51","shocking actually apparently nobody else "],["164.319","did their homework that year but that "],["167.08","wasn't a big surprise the hand shoe "],["168.489","award cuz I had ten years of ministry "],["170.62","experience probably to go into Seminary "],["172.03","preached a lot of sermons so I kind of "],["173.89","figured I I was gonna get that but that "],["176.5","academic award was a draw dropper I'd "],["180.37","never gotten an academic award in my "],["182.11","life so my parents were there and "],["185.08","they're very proud of me and my family "],["186.519","wife kids and and my in-laws and I buddy "],["189.82","come down from Canada flew in specially "],["193.33","and that was a really good day and that "],["196.69","was Saturday and then Sunday we all "],["198.97","drove down here and I started my first "],["201.22","Sunday at Faith Bible Church stepped out "],["203.92","onto this pulpit and began my ministry "],["206.2","here and likewise all my family and "],["208.18","friends joined in we're here and "],["209.95","celebrated with me so thankful for what "],["212.29","God had done in our lives to see us "],["213.85","through and open up this window of "],["215.44","opportunity to be back in the ministry "],["217.42","and back in the pastorate so when I "],["218.829","reflect upon that weekend it was very "],["220.93","rewarding and it was kind of nice to be "],["223.51","at the at your best there was a day when "],["227.2","Saul was at his best do you remember it "],["230.25","for so long he has done a lousy job it's "],["233.799","hard to remember that at one time he "],["235.66","actually did great when Saul ruled the "],["238.51","nation of Israel for forty years and he "],["241.42","was at his best actually forty years ago "],["243.43","back at the beginning First Samuel "],["246.22","Chapter eleven in Chapter eleven the "],["249.07","ammonites had come against a border city "],["251.709","called jabish Gilead Saul was anointed "],["256.15","the king but he hadn't done anything yet "],["258.31","to do any leadership he would just you "],["260.47","know basically was went back home and "],["262.18","started you know taking care of the "],["263.5","donkeys again but Jabez Gilead was in a "],["266.229","tough spot because the ammonites all "],["267.82","came up against them and they knew that "],["269.71","they were not strong enough to fight "],["271.36","back against the ammonites "],["272.71","so they tried to save their city with "],["274.75","diplomacy and the elders of jay-bez "],["276.729","Gilead said to the ammonites make a "],["278.289","treaty with us and we will serve you you "],["281.8","know we'll pay you taxes and "],["283.33","you know will kind of be under your rule "],["285.37","and the ammonites replied we'll make a "],["287.56","treaty with you "],["288.4","part of the treaty part of the agreement "],["290.439","is going to be everybody in the city has "],["292.3","to gourd they're right iOS and the elder "],["297.099","said well give us 7 days we'll get back "],["299.199","to you on that one and say say it's fine "],["301.659","so in that seven days they set out a "],["303.879","word they sent out messengers they sent "],["306.31","out Pony Express all through the country "],["309.189","telling the nation of Israel what they "],["311.56","were faced against it in a desperate "],["313.21","plead for help and that was when Saul "],["316.379","stepped up do you remember what he did "],["318.94","remember that story he took two oxen and "],["321.759","he hacked them into small pieces and he "],["324.43","shipped all those pieces to every "],["326.74","players in the country and he said "],["328.599","anyone who doesn't show up to support "],["331.24","and to follow Samuel and Saul this will "],["334","happen to you and I wouldn't recommend "],["337.15","to our president that he used that "],["338.62","tactic to garner support for his "],["341.139","leadership but back then that was very "],["343.93","effective and 300,000 men showed up and "],["347.62","saw led them up to jabish Gilead and "],["350.65","they destroyed the ammonites and Saul "],["353.59","was heralded as a war hero and a great "],["357.129","king and that was Saul's "],["359.259","best day because of that day forty years "],["363.339","ago he had the undying loyalty of the "],["367.69","people of jabish Gilead no matter how "],["370.659","lousy of a king he was jay-bez Gilead "],["373.12","would never forget and would always "],["375.069","appreciate the salvation that saw "],["376.93","brought to them so when they heard that "],["379.06","Saul's sons had been killed and that "],["381.279","Saul had been decapitated and that his "],["384.129","body was hung up on the wall of a Shan "],["386.349","as a war trophy as a means of "],["388.36","terrorizing the nation as a way of "],["390.009","gloating over their conquests this "],["391.839","arrogant hateful disrespectful act they "],["395.229","were offended and it stirred up that "],["398.05","undying loyalty for Saul and the valiant "],["400.839","men traveled all night down to best Shan "],["402.909","and even though the army had been "],["404.349","decimated by the Philistines and even "],["406.69","though the Philistines have bitterly "],["407.919","Illustrated their cruel intentions for "],["409.99","all of Israel nevertheless these guys "],["412.149","infiltrated enemy territory they risk "],["414.55","their lives to retrieve the remain "],["416.289","I saw the sons they took them back to "],["418.21","jabish Gilead and buried them under a "],["420.939","tamarisk tree and fasted for seven days "],["424.649","sometimes we'll read these actions in "],["427.24","the stories of the Old Testament and we "],["429.069","don't necessarily know everything that "],["431.529","is met behind the details well I want to "],["434.529","fill some of that in for you this "],["435.639","morning with these few short verses so "],["437.439","some very important details for us to "],["439.689","know first of all it says in the law of "],["441.46","Moses Deuteronomy 21 "],["443.229","if a man is commits a sin worthy of "],["445.089","death that he is to be put to death you "],["446.86","shall hang him on a tree his corpse "],["448.809","shall not hang all night on the tree you "],["452.05","will surely bury him on the same day for "],["455.229","he who is hanged "],["456.219","is the cursed of God so that you do not "],["458.86","defile your land which the Lord your God "],["460.749","give you as an inheritance bodies were "],["464.469","to be buried and put a sight it's a "],["467.439","curse to have them hanging out in public "],["470.08","so first we see that the men of jabish "],["472.509","Gilead are valiant because they are "],["474.339","honoring the law of God and they are "],["476.68","removing the defilement from the land "],["479.139","the whole hanging the body of saw on the "],["482.11","wall served as a scare tactic doesn't it "],["484.779","it's a mean of rubbing it in the "],["486.849","nation's space that we have overpowered "],["489.459","you so the valiant men of jay-bez are "],["491.769","serving the country by defying the "],["494.769","Philistines statements they're also "],["497.229","attempting to spare saw the curse of "],["499.809","being hung in such a dishonouring way it "],["503.919","is evident that they wish to honor the "],["505.749","king out of loyalty and repay the good "],["508.539","that saul did for them forty years "],["510.49","earlier something I have learned you "],["513.839","never lack when you give when you help "],["518.079","when you are good to people when you "],["520.659","bless folks they will look for an "],["522.639","opportunity to pay that back to you we "],["525.91","had a classic example of this yesterday "],["528.36","we know that Dave and Sandi wanted some "],["531.1","help with their roof and anytime anyone "],["533.829","needs any help around here you can count "],["536.29","on Dave and Sandi to help it's their "],["539.139","spiritual gifts they have the gift of "],["541.18","helps and service and they have "],["542.8","committed themselves to this body of "],["545.23","believers here at beit bible church for "],["547.48","years they have served all of our "],["549.519","socials our "],["550.48","our work projects are seniors ministries "],["553.6","if you ever need help Dave and Sandi "],["556.09","will show up and give you a helping hand "],["558.19","so when dave told me that he was looking "],["560.11","for help on his roof "],["561.43","I had Asik sneaking suspicion that there "],["563.77","would be lots of people that would be "],["566.14","eager to repay back that help so if you "],["569.23","happened down Forrest Hall Drive "],["570.82","yesterday morning you would have seen 20 "],["573.13","plus cars parked all up and down the "],["575.5","Drive at Dave and Sandy's house and all "],["578.05","these fellows showed up and I want to "],["580.33","thank all the guys that show that it was "],["581.83","so good to have you come out and "],["583.36","participate and and just just too many "],["587.74","guys actually showed up so well you know "],["590.83","you promised them smoked meat pastor Rob "],["592.48","so obviously guys would show up for that "],["593.98","actually I'd like to tell you that a "],["595.48","lunch a bunch of the guys that showed up "],["596.86","for the work project never made it back "],["598.18","to the church for the smoked meat they "],["599.95","just they just worked and then they had "],["601.72","other things to do but I guarantee you "],["603.79","that that that would have happened no "],["606.67","matter what meat or no me those guys "],["608.26","would have showed up to be a blessing to "],["610.18","people who are been a blessing to all of "],["613.06","us here at Faith Bible Church and that's "],["615.28","what commitment will earn you when you "],["618.43","show commitment to people you earn "],["620.83","people's commitment when Saul was at his "],["623.65","best he earned jabish gilead commitment "],["626.56","and loyalty this is sin this is the "],["629.62","symbolism behind the tamarisk tree it's "],["634.09","a symbol of commitment it comes from "],["636.36","Genesis chapter 21 all the way back in "],["640.39","Genesis 21 Abraham was the father of the "],["643.99","nation of Israel as you know and he was "],["645.85","called by God to leave his home and "],["647.47","journey to a distant land God made this "],["649.69","covenant with Abraham I'm gonna make a "],["651.49","great nation of you I'm gonna bless "],["653.41","those that bless you I'm gonna give you "],["655.18","this land and I'm gonna curse those that "],["656.65","curse you now Abraham and his journey "],["658.96","with God he he had a few missteps along "],["661.42","the way and one of them was with the "],["663.64","King Abimelech so Abraham meets King "],["666.28","Abimelech and Abimelech is right away "],["668.38","attracted to Sarah Abraham's wife "],["670.51","Abraham was fearful of these foreign "],["673.21","Kings in this new land so he thought "],["676","well this guy's gonna kill me and he's "],["677.44","gonna take my wife so he said she's my "],["680.47","sister and Abimelech said great and I "],["683.17","will marry her "],["684.25","since she's available but God in a dream "],["687.19","warned Abimelech if you touch Sarah you "],["690.16","will die because she is Abraham's wife "],["693.22","so Abraham in that situation showed a "],["696.37","lack of faith and commitment to God in "],["698.41","in that situation now in chapter 21 of "],["702.55","Genesis Abimelech and Abraham make a "],["706.21","covenant to be kind and to live at peace "],["709.3","with each other but there there was this "],["712.45","this disagreement over a well and "],["715.18","apparently Abraham's guys had dug a well "],["717.91","and built a well and then Abimelech "],["719.56","servants came along and took over the "],["721.78","well and chased the Abraham's guys away "],["724.12","and they didn't Abimelech parently "],["726.85","didn't know anything about it so Abraham "],["728.68","the two guys the two leaders Abraham and "],["730.51","Abimelech they resolved the situation by "],["733.33","making a covenant by taking an oath and "],["737.2","they named the place Beersheba which "],["740.14","means well of oath it says in verse "],["743.53","number 30 31 of Genesis 21 therefore "],["749.8","they call the place bare sheba because "],["752.1","the two of them there took an oath "],["755.38","so they made a covenant at Bathsheba and "],["757.48","Abimelech and Phil Cole the commander of "],["760.06","the army arose and returned to the land "],["762.19","of the Philistines "],["763.5","Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Bear "],["766.66","Seba and there he called on the name of "],["769.51","the Lord the everlasting God so Abraham "],["774.07","planted a tamra's tree and called on the "],["777.04","name of the Lord and the everlasting God "],["779.29","whenever someone makes a coven or an "],["781.6","oath they're making a what they're "],["784.81","making a commitment to one another and "],["787.93","this Tamara's tree was a representation "],["792.4","of that act of commitment that Abimelech "],["795.64","and Abraham made with each other now "],["798.22","trees are one of those things that "],["800.14","outlives all of us don't they you you "],["802.3","can remember trees when you were a kid "],["804.1","and they're still there today don't you "],["805.93","can you think about a few favorite trees "],["807.31","your head and they were around long "],["808.78","before you and they'll be probably long "],["810.67","around if nobody cuts them down long "],["812.92","after you unlike monuments which erode "],["815.95","or decay trees always "],["818.05","and then they reproduce and they stand "],["820.36","the test of time and since Abraham ever "],["823.87","since him and the tamra's tree of "],["825.97","Genesis 21 that tree represents to "],["829.66","Israel commitments the tamra's tree "],["832.36","stands as a monument to the people of "],["834.94","jabish Gilead concerning their "],["836.65","commitment to solve by burying him there "],["838.45","they are expressing their commitment to "],["840.91","King Saul even as it in his death they "],["843.25","remembered him and they are loyal and "],["845.11","committed to him and this level of "],["847.45","loyalty this level of commitment "],["849.49","brothers and sisters is priceless do you "],["852.85","value loyalty and commitment in your "],["855.55","life do you value people who keep their "],["858.94","word and say what they mean and means "],["861.1","what they say I do you know you're gonna "],["865.45","meet all kinds of different folks in "],["867.13","life all kinds of different "],["869.11","personalities and you know some people "],["871.03","come across real nice and polite and "],["873.37","agreeable and you know quiet and they "],["876.16","smile at you and that's good those are "],["877.69","those are virtuous things to be but "],["880.15","sometimes those people will will say "],["883.06","what you want them to say and they don't "],["885.37","like to be confrontational and they try "],["888.04","to avoid the heart saying the hard "],["889.84","things and they're just always kind no "],["891.94","matter what then you have these other "],["894.34","people who just roar and they're loud "],["898.48","and they're opinionated and they're "],["901.12","obnoxious and they're challenging and "],["903.22","sometimes they're offensive and you just "],["905.2","wish they would shut it all right just "],["908.14","stop and yet many times those are the "],["910.84","people that will just speak the truth "],["912.82","and we'll say what needs to be said and "],["914.86","they confront sin and it make you face "],["917.8","facts I know you're probably thinking of "],["919.54","a few right now in your mind the top "],["924.76","things about those kinds of "],["926.26","personalities and being those times of "],["927.97","personalities that sometimes people want "],["929.44","to get away from you and just you stir "],["932.02","things up too much for them just can't "],["934.24","we all get along since I grew up at a "],["936.84","Christian college and I've always been "],["938.98","around institutions I've noticed that "],["942.4","administration and faculty tend to "],["945.7","prefer those nice polite quiet studious "],["948.73","agreeable kids those compliant kids "],["952.53","but not just at school I've noticed that "],["955.3","also pastors and many times leaders "],["959.28","really prefer yes men who don't do as "],["964.6","they say and they don't really question "],["966.25","and they don't really argue lots of "],["968.83","times leaders struggle with with and "],["971.17","will marginalize the strong challenging "],["973.81","personalities sometimes you see honestly "],["976.66","that somebody's just won everybody shut "],["977.71","up and go along with what you want to do "],["978.79","right and we don't want to speak up when "],["980.68","we don't want all those questions we "],["981.97","don't like to be challenged but when you "],["985.57","do have those people around who agree "],["991.63","with you all the time sometimes you're "],["994.48","lacking severely and you don't always "],["997.15","get the whole story you don't always get "],["999.25","all the facts you don't always hear what "],["1002.79","you need to hear you hear what you want "],["1004.29","to hear but you always hear what you "],["1006.15","need to hear and pastor chest Mackenzie "],["1009.21","first fella who follow who mentored me "],["1011.7","in the ministry I quote him from time to "],["1014.49","time because he had these great great "],["1016.76","expressions he'd say many times "],["1019.61","institutions have a way of slaying lions "],["1022.26","and breeding foxes you know the little "],["1025.079","yes men the brown nosers always get "],["1026.85","promoted and those you know those loud "],["1029.1","annoying kids they get you know would

those loud "],["1039.23","lion personalities once you get one of "],["1043.199","those guys on your team and you win them "],["1045.03","low over they will be the most loyal "],["1047.85","people they will fight and they will die "],["1051.36","for you they say what they mean they "],["1053.7","mean what they say "],["1054.72","and when they give you their word they "],["1056.58","would die before

barrier that's the kind of people "],["1067.59","those are those valiant people and I "],["1069.75","value that type of loyalty because I've "],["1072.63","been with people who are friendly and "],["1074.73","nice to me and and they they talk they "],["1077.88","talk real good but then I've been left "],["1080.1","hanging when the battles came on and it "],["1083.13","was time to go to fight

"],["448.5","David completely out of the picture when "],["450.9","this particular Battle of philistine "],["452.639","versus Israelites take place it seems "],["455.46","here that God had decreed

"],["445.039","time you're done but it's just a "],["446.599","marathon so in Risk we love to play this "],["448.919","game it's basically a map of the world "],["451.8","and everyone gets their countries and "],["454.039","you try to take over other people's "],["455.759","countries got these little armies and "],["457.479","you try to take over other people's "],["458.8","countries so you can get their continent "],["460.56","and once you have a continent you get "],["462.28","more armies for that and eventually you "],["464.4","want to build up your armies and take "],["467.36","over the whole globe that's right take "],["469.72","over the whole "],["470.8","world and uh when we play this game we "],["474.8","we we we we we get a Contin and then we "],["476.68","build up our

"],["493.8","have to go make popcorn because I get "],["495.319","destroyed but you you you play the game "],["497.96","and you plot and you think okay you're "],["499.4","building up armies and he's building up "],["500.879","armies and you start to think "],["503.56","okay if I don't hit him soon he's going "],["506.919","to amass more armies than me and here's "],["509.24","the weakest Port here's the weakest "],["511.88","border weakest country in his border "],["513.959","I'll hit there and I'll take his "],["515.719","continent away and then I'll stomp him "],["517.64","down and then he'll be weaker than me "],["519.64","and uh that's that's kind of how you "],["521.12","play that game uh if I don't hit him "],["523.159","soon he'll have the upper "],["525","hand and then you do that likewise in "],["528.04","real life I think we're conditioned to "],["530.839","believe preemptive strike is wise right "],["533.88","I got to hit this guy before he gets too "],["535.56","big before something bad happens to me "],["537.959","but is that right "],["541.16","Proverbs 25 says if your enemy is "],["545.8","hungry "],["548.72","you there you go feed him if he is

"],["1490.039","instead to gain his friendship and "],["1492.76","understanding further the use of "],["1494.679","boycotts and methods of non-cooperation "],["1497.24","were the means to awaken a

"],["1546.799","evil and not "],["1548.799","individuals tension was not between "],["1550.96","races but it was between Justice and "],["1553.48","Injustice between the forces of light

was a victory for "],["1564.6","the force of light thus tension could "],["1567.039","only exist between good and evil and not "],["1570.24","between people and again David he's not "],["1573.36","competing to try to fight Saul he just "],["1575.799","wants to tell what we say last week the "],["1579.48","truth he wants to tell the truth David "],["1581.919","is embodying and

"],["1666.279","the universe is completely on the side "],["1668.96","of Justice accordingly people have a "],["1672","cosmic companion with God who's on the "],["1675.6","side of Truth therefore the

"],["1717","believed the importance of nonviolence "],["1719.519","rested in the fact that it prevented "],["1721.76","physical violence and the internal "],["1724.48","violence of

"],["244.08","been hunting him down and last week we "],["246.319","learned that david and his men were "],["247.76","hiding in the cave at ingeri and the "],["250.48","very cave that they were hiding in saul "],["252.56","came in all alone "],["255.12","by himself to "],["257.359","take care of some business by himself "],["258.959","and needed some privacy to do that and "],["261.04","while he

what'd he do "],["270.4","cut the robe caught the corner of his "],["272.16","royal robot that's right it was an act "],["274.32","that sends a message "],["276.32","sent a message that david has the "],["277.84","ability to take saul's royalty from him "],["281.6","it also was illustrating that david "],["283.12","could kill saul "],["284.96","but he chose not to "],["287.36","now the only

"],["408","me now think about ancient civilizations "],["411.68","uh the one judging and ruling "],["414.96","was usually the same person wasn't it "],["417.52","like the king or the "],["419.12","the chief he would be the guy with all "],["421.12","to say wouldn't he we view the law of "],["423.919","the land as something higher than "],["426.56","everyone in every position we are all "],["430.16","ruled by laws and if it's against the "],["432","law for one person it's against the law "],["434.479","for "],["435.84","everyone "],["437.44","in theory right "],["438.96","so supposedly certain people have been "],["441.12","appointed to execute the laws and they "],["444","too are bound by the law to conduct "],["446.4","themselves in a particular manner we "],["448.479","have presidents but we also have supreme "],["450.72","court judges "],["452.16","so ruling and judging has been spread "],["454.639","out in our economy to uh be done by not "],["458.56","one person but different people so not "],["461.199","one guy exclusively has all the power "],["463.12","but this is not always how it worked in "],["465.919","the ancient world nations tended to be "],["468.4","ruled by a single individual the king is "],["472.16","the ruler and the judge and the decider "],["474.24","of what is right and his word is law so "],["477.599","even if the king was violating some of "],["479.52","the laws of the land his word had more "],["482","pull and nobody could really do anything "],["484","about whatever he was doing so you know "],["486.16","from time to time prophets would show up "],["488.24","and rebuke the king and and "],["490.879","try to influence him to change his "],["492.56","actions but ultimately nobody could do "],["495.039","anything or move him out of office what "],["497.12","would be the only way to get rid of the "],["498.319","king "],["499.44","that's right you'd have to kill him "],["501.28","so like david could have done "],["503.12","so samuel for example he gave the word "],["505.28","of the lord to saul saying god is going "],["506.96","to remove the kingdom from you but "],["508.639","samuel didn't officially do it did he he "],["510.479","couldn't take him out of that position "],["512.56","this is why "],["514","saul can throw spears at people and he "],["517.039","doesn't get into trouble could the rest "],["518.56","of us do that no we couldn't do that but "],["520.159","he could do that "],["521.44","there's no means of holding him "],["523.039","accountable we're gonna hunt david down "],["524.959","and we're gonna kill him and it doesn't "],["526.56","matter what anybody thinks everyone has "],["528.64","to do it even jonathan has no capacity "],["532","to stop his

"],["544.399","saul's intentions are but david "],["546.839","nevertheless is confronting saul "],["549.6","before the lord he steps out there and "],["552.24","says my lord the king he bows himself "],["554.24","down verse number eight david says to "],["556.24","saul verse nine why do you listen to the "],["557.92","words of people of men saying behold "],["559.76","david seeks to harm you

isn't it that was the "],["582.08","facts of what had happened and sometimes "],["584.56","you just have to come out and speak the "],["586.48","truth "],["587.6","and trust god with the outcome now we "],["590.72","encourage our children to do this we try "],["592.48","to teach them that we want them to speak "],["594.08","truth and not worry about the "],["595.68","consequences but sometimes that "],["598.56","backfires because they'll turn around "],["600.8","and do that to us "],["602.32","right they'll occasionally put mom and "],["604.48","dad in their place but that's okay "],["606","because if they're speaking truth then "],["608.32","right is "],["609.6","right is right that's right and mom and "],["611.6","dad are not "],["613.36","always right "],["614.8","shocking

"],["734.399","fear right afraid often "],["737.68","fear of what is going to happen "],["740.48","fear of the unknown keeps us from "],["743.519","telling the truth now typically when it "],["745.519","comes to what could happen we tend to "],["748.88","think of the negative right "],["751.839","the worst thing "],["753.6","the worst case scenario that's what we "],["755.04","think is

"],["763.279","that was a very real possibility that "],["765.36","could happen and that's what david "],["767.519","scared if he doesn't want to die but is "],["769.68","that the only thing "],["771.68","that could happen "],["773.44","i had to confront my boss one time it "],["776.32","was my first job and i i really wasn't "],["779.2","happy with how he was treating me "],["782.639","i thought what's the worst thing he "],["784.32","could do to me "],["786.56","that's right he could fire me and i "],["788.24","thought can i live with that "],["790.32","and the answer was "],["792.16","yeah i can live with that because i "],["793.6","don't really like the way things are "],["795.04","going now anyway so if it doesn't change "],["797.519","i don't really want to work here anymore "],["799.68","but what else could happen "],["803.2","he could he could listen he could think "],["805.04","about it he could change right and "],["807.36","that's exactly what happened he he "],["810.32","listened to me he he realized that he "],["812.56","needed to lighten up and he saw the air "],["814.24","of his ways and he started treating me "],["815.92","better he started respecting me more and "],["817.76","and we our relationship improved and and "],["820.639","things went very smoothly after that "],["822.88","when you're going to speak the truth you "],["824.88","you probably first of all ought to count "],["826.8","the cost and consider what's the worst "],["828.56","thing that can happen "],["830.32","and then decide can i live with that "],["833.279","and generally you will conclude yeah "],["836.56","i can "],["837.839","live with that sometimes as a pastor i "],["840.48","have to confront somebody in their sin "],["842.56","and i think okay what's the worst thing "],["844.24","that's going to happen if i sit down "],["845.36","with this brother and i and i i "],["847.04","challenge him on this issue what's the "],["848.48","worst thing he could do to me "],["850.32","punch me in the face right bam doesn't "],["852.639","like me punch me right in the face or he "],["855.04","could try i mean "],["858.88","wax on "],["862","yeah everybody wants to try me now oh "],["863.519","yeah let's go rob you got nothing "],["868.48","okay can i can i live with that they "],["870.639","won't they'll get mad at me and they'll "],["872.16","storm out and they went over speak to me "],["873.68","again and they won't come back to church "],["875.76","can i live with that "],["877.199","that's why i don't know what anybody "],["878.32","gives around here right that's a good "],["879.68","thing i'm not influenced well i wonder "],["881.44","bobby knows but i don't know what

the truth "],["889.68","because that's what i'm supposed to do "],["891.76","as the pastor i'm supposed to speak "],["893.519","truth so yeah i can live with that "],["896.639","and then i got to be willing to tell it "],["899.839","our relationship would change but i "],["901.44","can't have a relationship if i can't "],["903.04","speak truth right you can't you can't "],["904.959","live with somebody if you can't tell "],["906.72","them the truth and expect that back "],["909.6","but what else could happen instead of "],["911.12","all the worst case scenario things "],["913.839","slash my

"],["53.199","Roberto because he was the first Grand "],["55.64","he was the first grandchild of everybody "],["58.64","and uh when Roberto was born ilana's "],["62.399","Aunt Lupe was a "],["64.08","seamstress and she would design these "],["67.32","and create these beautiful outfits and "],["69.92","uh her job was to create a line of "],["71.52","clothing that larger corporations "],["73.68","companies would come in and look at her "],["75.4","her clothing and then they would choose "],["77.2","a couple that they liked and they would "],["79.08","Mass produce them in China

"],["137.16","just close "],["138.48","everywhere and uh we believe this was "],["140.8","what formed Roberto's obsession with "],["143.36","fashion he's always been very particular

but Roberto on the other "],["173.72","hand is very opinionated and will give a "],["176.959","very blunt critique and his interest in "],["180.44","style and fashion has impacted the "],["182.599","entire family uh we he would dress "],["185.12","little Tony up in what he thought was "],["187.64","cool uh we we always joked that Tony was "],["190.68","mini Robbie since the time he was a just "],["193.28","a we little guy he never wore anything "],["196.2","age appropriate uh little little fellas "],["198.84","would have some Winnie the Pooh or some "],["201.04","Disney clothes on and Tony be dressed up "],["203.48","with a wife beater and a do-rag on you "],["205.92","know looking all hard and hipop and uh "],["208.72","then when he got a little old you know "],["210.56","you see these these kids with nice cargo "],["212.68","pants and a polo shirt and tony'd have "],["214.76","on some skinny jeans and a band shirt "],["217","and some skater shoes so he was always "],["219.319","looking like him now Rick was uh much "],["221.28","more defiant he he revolted against "],["224.12","Roberto's uh control and desire to be "],["226.319","his own man when it came to style but "],["228.84","eventually he relented one day he uh "],["232.319","came to realize he was a fashioned "],["233.84","disaster and needed some help I think it "],["236.959","coincided

"],["249.12","pun "],["251.28","intended towards maybe something that "],["253.64","the ladies could appreciate and talk "],["255.68","about clothing because in first Samuel "],["260.519","robes are a

"],["290.72","saw took the bib off right before you "],["292.28","brought her up didn't you just so she "],["293.6","could just look her her very best and "],["296.039","and Iana would always love to

"],["346","exposed they were ashamed and then they "],["349.08","clumsily tried to get some leaves "],["351.16","together and and craft some some "],["353.16","clothing for themselves and it didn't "],["354.919","work very well they wanted to hide from "],["357.68","God and they wanted to hide from each "],["359.36","other but God showed his great Mercy he "],["363.8","took pity on them this

"],["876.6","they were feeling were mourning and were "],["879.079","uncomfortable and were miserable and "],["881.24","then what else would they do to their "],["882.44","clothes when they were in

felt inside "],["892.6","that they that we are in a state of "],["895.92","Brokenness chapter uh 15 of first Sam "],["899.04","Samu we saw the foreing scene of Samuel "],["903.519","telling King Saul that God was going to "],["905.399","remove him as king due to his "],["908.24","Disobedience as Saul had turned as "],["911.56","Samuel had turned to leave after "],["913.04","pronouncing this decree

"],["938.639","carrying significance now keep that in "],["941.8","mind as we go to the action of 1 Samuel "],["945.36","chapter 24 I realized that was a very "],["947.199","long intro but uh we had to do that to "],["950.399","get to where we're going let's read 1st "],["952.519","Samuel 24 okay for all you folks that "],["954.36","are visiting here for the day uh we have "],["957.399","had uh David is in the wilderness and "],["960.88","King Saul is trying to kill him and he's "],["963.04","been chasing him around for several "],["964.44","weeks now and we've left David in the "],["966.319","wilderness and uh we've had a friend "],["968.24","visit him in the wilderness and he's "],["969.88","been saved in the wilderness but he's "],["971.279","SAR still he's in the wilderness and "],["973.8","what's he supposed to do enjoy the "],["976.04","Wilderness right and God's got a plan "],["977.959","and God's working some things out but "],["979.399","here's some more action in the "],["980.48","wilderness 1st Samuel chapter 24 and "],["983.44","when Saul returned from pursuing the "],["985.199","Philistines he was told behold David is "],["987.88","in the wilderness of and getting and "],["990.759","Saul took 3,000 chosen men from all of "],["993.399","Israel and went to seek David and his "],["995.519","men in front of the rocks of the wild "],["996.88","goats how many men did David have by the "],["998.36","way you remember remember 600 that's "],["1002.519","right somebody remembered he had 600 and "],["1004.399","Saul's got 3,000 men coming after him "],["1007.56","and he came to the shepherd's PO on the "],["1009.199","way where there was a "],["1011.16","cave and Saul went in to relieve "],["1016.199","himself now David and his men were "],["1018.48","sitting in the inner recesses of the "],["1021.519","cave visualize that for a moment the men "],["1024.439","of David said behold this is the day "],["1027.36","which the Lord has said to you behold I "],["1029.24","am going to give your enemy into your "],["1031.28","hand and you shall do as what it seems "],["1034.12","good to you and David arose and he cut "],["1038.079","off the edge of Saul's robe "],["1042.12","secretly it came about afterwards that "],["1044.679","David's conscience bothered him because "],["1046.72","he cut the edge of Saul's robe so said "],["1049.2","to his men far be it from me because of "],["1051.96","the Lord that I should do this thing to "],["1053.679","my Lord the Lord's anointed to stretch "],["1056.559","out my hand against him since he is the "],["1058.919","Lord's anointed so David persuaded his "],["1061.12","men with these words and they did not "],["1063.52","allow them to rise up against Saul Saul "],["1066.76","arose and left the cave and went his "],["1071.64","way okay it's pretty clear what's going "],["1074.28","on here Saul needs some privacy so that "],["1077.679","he can sit on the the porcelain Throne "],["1080.919","so he goes into the cave thinking that "],["1083","he's alone and he can take care of his "],["1085.24","business the very cave where David and "],["1088.12","his men are hiding now I don't care who "],["1092.159","you are or how prim and proper you are "],["1094.559","you can't miss the irony of this scene "],["1097.52","right Saul is this powerful intimidating "],["1100.24","King using all of his Force to hunt "],["1103","David down meanwhile David's and his "],["1105.64","guys are scared and running for their "],["1107.84","lies but but now in this scene here in "],["1111.4","this moment Saul does not look very "],["1114.64","powerful or intimidating does he on the "],["1117.24","contrary he's been caught with his pants "],["1120.36","down very vulnerable and very "],["1123.08","embarrassing position and the reality is "],["1126.24","at this moment David can do whatever he "],["1129.48","wants to Saul and Saul's men are like oh "],["1133.44","this is a gift from God he has delivered "],["1135.6","your enemy into your hand take him out "],["1138.52","he "],["1139.32","defenseless but instead of killing "],["1142.28","Saul David does something to send a "],["1145.52","message now for us simply cutting the "],["1148.919","the robe cutting a part of his robe we "],["1151.28","would say well that's his way of saying "],["1153.2","hey I I could have cut your throat could "],["1155.36","have cut anything I wanted I took a "],["1156.6","piece of your robe you know sends a "],["1157.88","message but I think cutting of the robe "],["1160.52","is more significant than that just like "],["1162.96","the tearing of Samuel's robe indicated "],["1166.24","the tearing away of the Kingdom by "],["1168.36","taking a piece of the royal robe David "],["1171.4","has indicated that I will be the one "],["1174","taking your royalty I will be the one "],["1176.96","taking your spot it's an act of "],["1179.44","aggression and Defiance now up until "],["1182.28","this point David has made no attacks or "],["1184.48","no acts of aggression against Saul up "],["1186.44","until now we learned last week he's been "],["1188.039","playing what he's been playing defense "],["1190.88","right he's done nothing to threaten Saul "],["1194","this was a threat and everyone would "],["1196.799","have understood the significance of "],["1198.32","being able to cut something of Royal "],["1201.039","significance off of the king and after "],["1204.44","he did that it really bothered David's "],["1207.64","conscience because he knew it was an act "],["1209.52","of defiance David didn't want to be "],["1211.6","defiant he didn't want to attack Saul "],["1213.88","primarily because Saul was God's "],["1217.6","Anointed God had put Saul in as king and "],["1221.24","it was ultimately God's will to have "],["1224","Saul in there and Saul would no longer "],["1226.64","be on the throne once God de decided to "],["1229.24","remove him until then David respected "],["1232.2","the position maybe he didn't respect the "],["1234.24","person the man didn't necessarily "],["1236.12","deserve the honor but the position that "],["1238.52","he held did deserve honor because Saul "],["1242.12","really was God's and David holds great "],["1245.24","respect and the highest esteem for God "],["1247.6","so this reason he says I shouldn't I "],["1249.32","shouldn't have done so David was wise in "],["1252.84","that he said recognized that he needed "],["1255.24","to wait for God to exalt him to not take "],["1257.72","matters into into his own hand God would "],["1260.48","bring David out of the Wilderness and "],["1263.24","God was going to give him the Royal "],["1265.24","robes when it was God's time he just had "],["1269.08","to be patient and humble and "],["1273.76","faithful well isn't that all very "],["1276.72","interesting "],["1278.72","question what does any of this have to "],["1280.679","do with us what what are we supposed to "],["1282.919","use this "],["1284.44","for there's a lot of in here that we we "],["1288.72","can learn and I think you all know all "],["1291.32","too well it will take us a number of "],["1293.6","Sundays to get through it "],["1296.4","all but I didn't want I didn't want you "],["1300.2","to miss the symbolism of the robe "],["1302.32","because there are certain things "],["1303.96","pertaining to the robes that relate to "],["1306.52","us the clothing and the action taking "],["1310.159","place with the clothing

have a lot of fancy moves so "],["48","they try to beat you make you go for one "],["50.6","of their fakes and get around you and "],["52.44","with those guys you have to be very "],["54","disciplined

"],["60.879","are bigger than you and they just want "],["62.12","to bully you they just want to plow into "],["63.8","you and shove you around and for those "],["65.6","guys you just got to get real

"],["88.88","they get there because you can't catch "],["90.56","them and then there's some players who "],["92.56","are bigger faster and more skilled and "],["96.759","uh there really is no way you

"],["500.08","get this news isn't he this uh "],["502.199","intelligence he he but you notice he's "],["504.319","not in a rush to get over there and grab "],["506.479","them up he he says to them uh

"],["293.52","let's accomplish three verses "],["298.16","verse 15. now david became aware that "],["300.24","saul had come out to seek his life while "],["302.639","david was in the wilderness of zif at "],["304.32","horish "],["305.6","and jonathan saul's son arose and went "],["308.639","to david and horace and encouraged him "],["311.28","in god "],["313.12","thus "],["314.32","he said to him do not be afraid because "],["317.12","the hand of saul my father will not find "],["319.6","you and you will be king over israel and "],["322.56","i will be next to you and saul my father "],["325.12","knows that also so the two of them made "],["327.919","a covenant before the lord and david "],["330.4","stated horus while jonathan went to his "],["333.52","house "],["335.039","jonathan saul's son "],["337.199","david's best friend "],["339.759","comes to him "],["341.44","jonathan "],["343.039","can't do anything to get david out of "],["345.44","the wilderness "],["347.12","but he can encourage david while he's in "],["350.16","it "],["351.199","since doing this study in the book of "],["352.96","first samuel i have become a big fan of "],["355.36","jonathan's i never really looked that "],["357.36","deeply at jonathan but i i think he "],["359.6","really would have made a good king you "],["360.96","know every time we see jonathan he's "],["363.44","acting in faith and he's speaking the "],["365.919","truth and this morning once again he is "],["368.24","an example to us of what to do for "],["370.96","people when they are in the wilderness "],["374","verse number 16 jonathan arose went to "],["377.68","david and encouraged him in the lord "],["380.88","he went to david and encouraged him in "],["383.039","god "],["384.16","the hebrew word for encouraged is "],["386.8","kazakh "],["388.24","it means to fasten a hold of to seize to "],["393.12","bind aid amend encourage fortify "],["397.6","to behave yourself valiantly so you're "],["400.639","you're propping somebody up you're "],["403.039","you're giving them one of those pep "],["404.56","talks one of those come on guys let's "],["406.319","let's go type of pep rally things before "],["409.199","we just had a pep rally kca is to get us "],["411.199","all charged up to to go out there and do "],["413.52","the fight sometimes while you're in the "],["415.68","wilderness "],["417.199","when you're in the middle of the "],["418.319","struggle you need to be reminded about "],["421.199","why you're even here why am i fighting "],["423.44","this battle is it worth it why don't we "],["425.919","just go someplace else why bother with "],["428.56","this let's just "],["430.88","quit "],["433.199","you know that's an option right quit you "],["435.28","can always just quit "],["437.52","except for david quitting would mean "],["440.639","death "],["441.599","because if he goes and turns himself "],["443.039","over to saul saul is going to "],["446","use him for target practice for the "],["447.44","spears again "],["449.68","and uh that's really not much of an "],["451.52","option "],["452.479","all the guys that are with david that "],["454.56","they're not paid to be there nobody's "],["456.479","forcing them to be with david they they "],["458.639","could quit they could leave at any time "],["460.56","except we remember we learned that they "],["462.319","were the destitute the dismayed the in "],["465.12","debt people and they don't anywhere else "],["467.44","to go either besides since they've been "],["469.52","with david they too could be on saul's "],["472.319","most wanted list "],["474.56","so quitting can mean death not always "],["477.52","sometimes quitting means failing just "],["480.08","means "],["480.879","you lose i have coached 17 seasons of "],["483.68","basketball eight seasons of soccer "],["486.24","that's do the math 25 seasons in total "],["489.68","they have not all been winning seasons "],["492.8","actually my exact record is 17 "],["496.16","and eight "],["497.84","the number one reason why i've suffered "],["499.84","through losing seasons "],["502.16","is guys who i expected to play guys who "],["504.8","i counted to be on the team who at one "],["507.12","time were part of the team decided they "],["509.36","didn't want to do it anymore and they "],["512.399","they quit "],["513.519","and because they quit it hurt the team "],["515.68","it left us short and we were lacking "],["519.519","you know what causes a church to die or "],["522.56","a school to shut down or an organization "],["525.279","to close his doors "],["526.8","very simply people stop showing up "],["528.959","people quit on it "],["531.36","chris and i both went to the same "],["532.64","college and seminary and "],["535.12","it's out of business now nobody wanted "],["537.2","to go anymore and they had to shut the "],["538.88","doors i have one friend who's still on "],["541.04","the campus he acts as the caretaker of "],["542.88","the property until it's officially sold "],["544.959","he said that's the hardest thing is it's "],["546.48","just empty there's nobody here "],["548.399","used to be an active vibrant place and "],["550.08","now it's just nobody at all "],["553.12","now "],["554.48","there may be some good reasons to quit "],["556.56","something i understand that that "],["558.64","whatever the reasons are it will still "],["561.279","equal the same result it'll still end up "],["563.36","with a failure "],["564.959","sometimes things need to fail "],["568.399","i understand that sometimes things are "],["570.32","bad and they're offering poor service "],["573.519","they just shouldn't be open anymore but "],["575.519","sometimes things fail not because "],["577.04","they're bad or they're flawed sometimes "],["579.04","they fail because of a lack of "],["580.8","commitment "],["582.08","loyalty and steadfastness "],["585.44","many times commitment loyalty and "],["587.519","steadfastness is the difference between "],["589.6","a championship team or "],["592.08","a losing season "],["594.48","but if you "],["596.72","quit "],["597.92","then you can say "],["599.279","well i didn't lose "],["600.88","right i didn't fail because i quit so i "],["603.92","don't feel like i failed i got off that "],["606.56","sinking ship okay so true because you "],["608.8","didn't participate technically you "],["610.24","didn't lose but you know what else you "],["612.16","accomplish "],["613.76","by not participating "],["616.24","you know what you accomplish "],["618.64","nothing "],["620.24","nothing "],["621.2","by not trying by not engaging "],["624.16","by quitting you accomplished nothing you "],["627.68","didn't die you didn't lose but you did "],["631.279","nothing you achieve "],["633.279","nothing you won "],["635.36","nothing

"],["138.84","zip where is that well let's do a "],["141.04","geography lesson doesn't everyone love "],["142.76","geography I do I like Maps so here's a "],["145.08","map of Israel and you have here uh on "],["149.48","this side "],["150.76","laser work Mediterranean Sea Sea of "],["153.92","Galilee here this of course you know "],["155.72","where who grew up "],["157.36","there Jesus very good that's always the "],["159.519","right answer right Eric Jesus Jesus grew "],["161.959","up here and uh down here is the Dead Sea "],["165.44","over here now in our our timeline we're "],["167.4","in the Old Testament so this was the "],["169.36","land of the um Philistines and over here "],["173.64","this Hill Country you can kind of see it "],["175.4","in the topographical map is is where "],["177.48","Israel uh dwelt uh so so let's zoom in a "],["180.519","little more next this is more what we're "],["182.64","talking about today here's the Dead Sea "],["184.519","blown up uh this is the land of the "],["186.56","Philistines and here's these Hill "],["188.28","Country where you have more of the "],["190.319","action that's been going on in 1 Samuel "],["193.44","chapter uh well all 1 Samuel really so "],["196.56","uh Gibby is where we've seen and we saw "],["199.04","how U Saul attacked the people at knob "],["202.28","that was here uh recently we saw David "],["205.84","uh save the people at Kayla which is "],["208.239","here and then hide in the forest of he "],["210.76","and now he has fled Kayla and he's gone "],["213.4","as we've read in verse number 14 to Z "],["216.879","here and he's in the uh Wilderness of Z "],["220.68","I wonder what the Wilderness of Z looks "],["222.599","like well here it is that's what it "],["225.04","looks like right there nothing like St "],["228.319","Mary's County is it no vegetation no "],["231.72","water no industry no "],["235.84","people dirt that's how I would describe "],["239.28","that "],["240.36","you know who wants to go to the "],["242.76","Wilderness anybody here nobody nobody "],["247","exactly nobody wants to go it's hot it's "],["249.2","Barren it's tough to survive there's no "],["251.56","food there's no water there's no apple "],["253.72","picking no people because everyone stays "],["257.479","away from the Wilderness so my question "],["260.32","then is why does David remain in the "],["263.96","wilderness why does he yab there well "],["267.44","very simply because well it's out of "],["269.32","necessity isn't it he has to Saul was "],["272.479","trying to find him and guess what "],["274.24","because nobody lives in the wilderness "],["275.56","nobody wants to live in the wilderness "],["277.12","Saul's boys don't want to live in the "],["278.84","wilderness Saul does not want to hang "],["280.759","out in the wilderness he wants to sit on "],["282.28","his throne in giba he doesn't want to "],["284.08","trapes around this area trying to find "],["286.479","David it's hard to find him he I mean "],["288.08","you go there you say okay guys we're "],["289.44","gonna find "],["291.039","David you know all right which way you "],["293.68","want to go that way you could travel for "],["295.52","days in that direction and not find him "],["297.16","he could be all the way over here and "],["298.759","you're going to completely wrong "],["299.88","Direction he can be over any one of "],["301.4","these Hills hiding somewhere and you'd "],["303.68","have to search the whole thing to find "],["304.96","him does anybody want to do that no just "],["308.12","Ricky okay Rick go ahead hit it "],["310.68","buddy we'll wait here for "],["313.199","you there's nobody to get directions "],["315.68","from there's nobody to interrogate "],["317.759","there's no towns he can attack either is "],["320.039","there there's no towns that he can "],["321.72","threaten people's lives so even though "],["324.08","David doesn't want to be in the "],["325.56","Wilderness At This Moment In Time the "],["328.52","Wilderness is exact ly where he needs to "],["331.199","be it's the safest play to be place to "],["334.319","be so he's just

"],["25.98","want to read them again just to set the "],["28.019","context for what we're going to study "],["30.18","today so first Samuel chapter 23 verse "],["33.059","number 1 and we read then they told "],["36.12","David saying behold the Philistines are "],["38.04","fighting against Kayla and are "],["39.48","plundering the threshing floors "],["41.94","so David inquired of the Lord saying "],["44.1","shall I go and attack these Philistines "],["46.92","the Lord said to David "],["48.539","go and attack the Philistines and "],["49.98","deliver Caleb but David's men said to "],["52.559","him behold "],["54.3","we are afraid here in Judah how much "],["56.82","more than if we go to Kayla against the "],["59.16","ranks of the Philistines "],["61.14","David inquire to the Lord once more and "],["63.42","the Lord answered him and said arise go "],["65.4","to Kayla for I will give the Philistines "],["68.04","into your hand "],["69.9","so David and his men went to Kayla and "],["72.72","fought the Philistines and he led away "],["75.299","their livestock and struck them with a "],["78.479","great Slaughter thus David delivered the "],["81.299","inhabitants of Kayla "],["83.46","we studied all that two weeks ago "],["86.64","now it came about when ABA threw the son "],["89.939","of elimelech fled to David at Kayla that "],["92.46","he came down with an ephod in his hand "],["95.46","a little bit of information for you to "],["97.2","hang on to "],["98.579","when it was told Saul that David had "],["101.52","come to Kayla Saul said "],["103.799","God has delivered him into my hand for "],["107.34","he shut himself in in by entering a city "],["110.52","with Double Gates and bars and then "],["113.82","you're supposed to put in an evil laugh "],["117.84","at least I think it's a it's the "],["119.82","original Hebrew "],["123.36","so Saul summoned all the people of War "],["125.399","to go to Kayla to besiege David and his "],["128.16","men now David knew that Saul was "],["130.86","plotting evil against him so he said to "],["132.54","Aviator the priest bring the ephod here "],["136.26","David said O Lord God of Israel your "],["139.14","servant has heard for certain that Saul "],["141.54","is seeking to come to Caleb to destroy "],["143.4","the city on my accounts "],["146.4","will the men of Kayla surrender me into "],["148.98","his hand "],["150.36","will Saul come down just as your servant "],["152.76","is heard "],["153.84","tune in next week no the Lord said the "],["156.84","Lord God of Israel said I pray the Lord "],["159.66","God of Israel I pray tell your servant "],["162.18","and the Lord said he will come down "],["165.36","and David said well the men of Kayla "],["167.459","surrender me and my men into the hand of "],["169.379","Saul "],["170.459","and the Lord said "],["172.14","they will surrender you "],["173.94","then David and his men about 600 arose "],["177.18","and departed Kayla and they went "],["179.459","wherever they could "],["181.56","go when it was told Saul the David "],["184.08","escaped Kayla he gave up the pursuit "],["186.66","David stayed in the wilderness and in "],["188.76","the strongholds and remained in the Hill "],["191.28","Country in the wilderness of zif and "],["193.44","Saul sought him every day but God did "],["195.9","not deliver him into his hands so what I "],["200.34","observed here is that David hears at the "],["202.739","beginning of the chapter that the "],["203.94","Philistines are in case are going Kayla "],["207.3","and he wants to go and help and Save "],["210.72","and does that "],["212.28","Saul hears Davids and Kayla and he wants "],["215.4","to go trap and destroy "],["219.42","I remembered Jesus said to the Pharisees "],["222.18","in John 8 44 you are of your father the "],["225.299","devil the desires of your father you "],["227.519","want to do he was a murderer from the "],["230.099","beginning and he does not stand for "],["231.659","truth because there's no truth in him "],["233.58","when he speaks lies he speaks his own "],["235.799","resources he is a liar and a father of "],["238.56","it "],["239.76","Jesus said in John 10 10 the thief comes "],["242.64","to steal and kill and destroy but I am "],["245.22","come that you might have life and life "],["248.58","more abundantly "],["250.439","so we continue to see whose spirit is in "],["254.099","Saul versus whose spirit is in David "],["255.9","based on what they do and how they act "],["259.739","Saul is all about the killing and "],["261.479","destroying like the devil because "],["263.639","there's an evil spirit in him and like "],["265.74","Jesus David is all about saving and "],["268.86","helping people in their time of need all "],["271.62","about the Abundant Life you might have "],["273.36","life and you might have a more "],["274.38","abundantly and that's what I want to be "],["276.6","all about as well the Abundant Life the "],["279.24","Greek word is precisos means Superior or "],["284.28","excessive and who doesn't like the sound "],["286.74","of that come to Jesus for abundance I "],["290.82","mean look at David here in chapter 23 "],["293.34","he's just rolling in the abundance isn't "],["295.8","he he saves the town and everyone is so "],["298.56","thankful and grateful and everyone's "],["300.479","there to help him wait a minute that's "],["303.18","not what happened here at all "],["305.52","where's the abundance "],["307.62","David's doing the will of God and "],["309.84","David's uh the anointed king of Israel "],["313.02","so why is everything so daggone hard for "],["316.38","David "],["317.16","if God is with David shouldn't it be "],["320.22","easy "],["321.479","doesn't God's team always win "],["324.84","David has this big victory in Kayla and "],["327.6","he conquers the Philistines and he saves "],["329.34","the city and this you would think would "],["332.28","restore him to his national heroes hero "],["334.919","status this you would think would earn "],["337.74","him some loyalty from the people of "],["340.08","Kayla David and his men have conquered "],["342.18","their fears they came out of hiding God "],["344.28","was with them delivered the Philistines "],["346.32","into their hand obviously God is David "],["349.08","is listening to God being used by God "],["353.1","so now that God is with him we can see "],["356.52","that then everything should be easy "],["359.12","breezy right this is all going to fall "],["362.699","into place now the people are going to "],["364.32","get on his side and the nation will "],["366.479","rally behind him and Saul's gonna go oh "],["369.36","see the air of his ways and and repent "],["372.419","and and graciously retire and hand him "],["375.66","the crown "],["377.34","by the way that's my personal opinion "],["379.199","what Saul should have done how he could "],["381.78","have spared his life and his son's life "],["383.58","he could have saved his whole family if "],["385.68","he simply would have admitted "],["387.479","I'm no longer God's anointed

"],["419.22","Samuel you're going to see he loses "],["420.84","badly too bad he didn't just resign it "],["423.9","would have made David's life so much "],["426.36","easier because that's the way

my "],["111.92","prayer is that i'll be a minister not "],["113.92","only to the people of the philippines "],["115.28","but also "],["116.24","more importantly to my own family so i'm "],["118.88","thankful that i get the opportunity "],["121.28","and here we are in the mountains kind of "],["124","a nearby region where we have a ministry "],["132.64","there we go okay "],["134.08","where is the philippines a little "],["135.599","geography lesson "],["139.36","just because this is important to to "],["141.599","know you know sometimes we get caught in "],["143.52","our small little world "],["145.04","and we don't know "],["146.48","i have a story briefly didn't share in "],["149.12","the first time but i think it's kind of "],["150.4","interesting i was talking on the phone "],["152.56","with my wife "],["153.76","this is probably about seven years ago "],["156","and when we're not in the philippines i "],["157.84","try to practice my language skills and "],["160","the national language is filipino "],["161.68","tagalog and i was talking to her on the "],["164.48","phone and what there was a lady "],["166.4","that was nearby you know she said what "],["169.36","language were you speaking you know i "],["170.8","forgot the phone i said i was speaking "],["172.4","filipino she looks at me straight in the "],["174.239","face and says oh are you filipino "],["178","i'm like yeah yeah how could you guess i "],["180.56","look just like an asian person "],["182.72","so i mean you know it's helpful to know "],["184.8","geography because maybe people don't "],["186.239","know where the philippines is it's in "],["187.599","southeast asia so that's the first and "],["189.92","last time that anybody questioned looked "],["191.92","at me in the face and asked me if i'm "],["193.2","filipino "],["195.68","the philippines is in southeast asia "],["198","it's consists of 7107 "],["200.159","islands three major divisions luzon "],["202.64","visayas and mindanao as you know it was "],["204.48","a big battleground during world war ii "],["206.8","and national language is they called "],["208.959","tagalog or filipino but we have over 87 "],["212.72","different dialects and languages in the "],["214.56","philippines so it makes it unique "],["217.36","being that "],["218.799","many different languages it's funny "],["220.959","because i took the mission team faith "],["222.48","bible church "],["224.4","one year we went on a little mountain "],["226.959","church area ministry "],["228.879","20 miles up the road "],["230.72","they they were speaking one different "],["232.56","dialect actually it's a dialect that "],["234.56","even my wife didn't know you know when "],["236.319","you go to this place you know sometimes "],["238.159","with small kids you need an interpreter "],["240.319","but as they get older you know people "],["242.72","know three or four different languages "],["244.239","and my wife she speaks three different "],["245.519","languages but as we go 20 miles further "],["248.08","down the road the second church that we "],["249.439","went to and i took the other one it was "],["251.92","a different dialect altogether and you "],["254.08","probably didn't catch that but it's "],["255.84","amazing how many different languages "],["258","there are in the philippines "],["259.919","and the good thing about the philippines "],["261.68","for a lot of foreigners that come there "],["263.36","people in america "],["265.12","is that english is spoken as a second "],["267.52","language "],["268.4","and it is one of the national languages "],["270.479","of the philippines along with tagalog or "],["272.479","filipino so that's a nice thing you can "],["275.04","feel it more comfortable there being "],["276.72","that it was a us territory for 50 years "],["280.16","kind of like how puerto rico is and they "],["282.32","can speak english and probably another "],["284.8","two or three different languages so "],["286.4","that's the wonderful thing about them "],["287.759","being there especially in baguio we got "],["289.28","90 million people "],["290.8","and uh and i guess the thing one of the "],["293.68","the first "],["294.8","thing that the team here at faith bible "],["297.12","they realize they get off the plane "],["298.56","there's a lot of folks in a very densely "],["300.88","populated uh country "],["305.36","here's a picture of the market there "],["307.199","some of the "],["308.32","veggies and the nice thing about being "],["310.4","in the philippines especially where we "],["312.56","are we live in the salad bowl of the "],["314.479","philippines they call it so we get a lot "],["317.12","of the fresh vegetables that come from "],["318.72","the mountains "],["320","and it's especially if you like fresh "],["322.639","salads is one of the best places to go "],["324.479","and i ate it every night so uh the nice "],["327.28","thing about shopping in the market "],["329.68","is you know the vegetables are more "],["331.759","fresh and that normally is cheaper my "],["333.52","wife loves the market you know you could "],["335.52","go to the grocery store we do have "],["336.88","grocery stores in the philippines but "],["338.32","it's not as fresh the vegetables so it's "],["340.96","it's really nice to go to the market "],["343.84","here is what we call a jeepney most "],["346.08","filipinos don't have their own car you "],["348.56","know cars are more expensive there than "],["350.56","they are here in the states and i'd say "],["353.12","times two or times three sometimes with "],["354.96","a price so "],["356.96","most filipinos take public "],["358.639","transportation "],["360.08","and this is the main mode is what they "],["361.759","call please go back one last slide the "],["364.319","jeepney and the jeepney there you can "],["366.88","get that you face each other side to "],["368.8","side "],["369.68","and uh you can get 10 people on this row "],["371.919","and other 10 people here and if you "],["373.84","really want to get creative and you need "],["375.6","you don't have a lot of space "],["377.36","we can what we call top load and you get "],["379.68","10 10 or 15 people on the top "],["382.08","you know not very safe "],["384","especially when you're going down a "],["385.919","mountainous curve there but you know "],["388.16","they're a little creative when it comes "],["390.08","to that and you get three or four people "],["391.44","hanging off the back "],["392.96","so uh you know "],["395.68","and it's it's interesting it's funny you "],["397.919","know "],["398.8","going one time on a bus they do take a "],["400.96","lot of buses as well "],["402.479","you can put goats on the top of the bus "],["404.639","and chickens and all sorts of farm "],["407.12","animals so they get really creative on "],["409.759","what they do this is the mission team "],["411.84","this was their main source of "],["413.199","transportation when you got a team of 12 "],["415.759","or a team of eight how to put everybody "],["418.479","in one vehicle we take the jeepney so "],["420.8","it's a lot of fun "],["422.479","next picture "],["424.16","here is another source of transportation "],["426.16","public transportation is called the "],["427.599","tricycle you normally have two people "],["430.24","there on the back you got the driver and "],["431.759","they got a little side car hence the "],["433.68","word tricycle there and the sidecar you "],["436.319","can get "],["437.28","three or four people "],["439.52","five uncomfortably in the tricycle "],["442.72","so it's amazing personal space "],["445.68","what i've noticed as opposed to the "],["447.36","states you know in america we value our "],["449.44","personal space but over there you know "],["451.68","it's just "],["452.96","it's just not "],["454.56","something that you know you they try to "],["456.56","squeeze you in "],["458.08","so uh something different that they have "],["459.84","to get used to "],["461.759","here is a city of manila so the first "],["464.88","thing you when you come to the "],["466.24","philippines you'll probably fly into "],["467.759","manila you get off the plane "],["470.319","and the first thing you notice is wow "],["472.8","heat and humidity you know it just comes "],["475.44","at you when you get off the plane "],["477.44","and then "],["478.56","the pollution that's a problem as well "],["480.16","but manila "],["481.759","in the greater area of manila with all "],["483.919","the little "],["484.96","uh suburbs i think somebody says "],["486.96","something like 17 million "],["489.199","that's a it makes it one of the largest "],["490.96","cities in the world you know so you got "],["493.36","a lot of people in "],["495.28","the philippines "],["496.8","in manila what are the religions "],["500.24","or what is the main religion "],["502.96","is "],["504.72","the main denomination is roman "],["506.24","catholicism is "],["507.639","82.9 percent "],["509.919","and islam is a growing "],["512.56","uh religion all over in the philippines "],["514.64","it's five percent "],["516.24","especially in the south but they have "],["518.479","made their way toward the north "],["521.039","and then evangelical christianity "],["522.88","protestant protestantism is 2.8 percent "],["526.399","and uh there's a group called iglesia "],["528.24","christo translated church of christ but "],["530.64","they deny the deity of christ their "],["532.399","occult are different from what we call "],["534.08","the american church of christ and other "],["536.32","christian is 4.5 percent "],["538.64","so we have a a big hodgepodge of "],["541.2","religion and "],["542.56","people in the philippines i'd say "],["545.12","nearly all filipinos believe in a deity "],["548.08","or believe in god "],["549.68","and there's atheism is not very common "],["552","there very religious people "],["554.399","and the interesting thing about the "],["556","philippines uh most of them believe in "],["558.88","jesus christ as being god himself and "],["561.68","the son of god they believe that jesus "],["563.839","christ died was buried and roseman dead "],["566.24","but the biggest difference theologically "],["569.6","is grace versus works in salvation and "],["572.56","eternal life you know you asked many "],["574.72","people what does it take uh you know "],["577.12","what must you do to have eternal life "],["578.88","and they'll name of list "],["580.959","a to-do list "],["582.32","be a good person "],["583.76","join the church give your money so it's "],["586","all about works but as we know what "],["588.8","separates biblical christianity from "],["591.2","other religions of the world and we know "],["593.2","that biblical christianity is not a "],["594.32","religion but it's relationship with "],["595.44","jesus christ but what separates us from "],["597.76","the others "],["598.88","it is a "],["600.08","grace eternal life a grace justification "],["602.8","that is through christ and not through "],["604.8","anything that we do christ did the work "],["607.04","not us so uh that is what separates us "],["610.08","from other uh groups and what unites all "],["612.959","true biblical all true christians is the "],["615.279","personal work of christ by grace alone "],["618.56","through christ alone so we're very "],["620.48","thankful to share that message of the "],["622.24","personal work of christ and anytime we "],["624.399","come into a teaching opportunity the "],["626.399","first thing that i want to do is share "],["627.92","the gospel "],["629.36","because we know the gospel is the power "],["630.959","of god unto salvation to all who believe "],["633.279","that jesus christ died for our sins he "],["635.6","was buried and he rose from the dead so "],["637.44","a very central "],["639.04","theme in christianity is the personal "],["641.2","work of christ through the gospel "],["644","next slide by baguio city where is "],["646","baguio city "],["647.36","you can tell here it's a little dot here "],["649.279","on the map it's 120 miles "],["652.16","pretty much due north of manila "],["654.56","and about six hour drive or a van drive "],["658.399","bus ride if you you know because of the "],["660.8","roads and everything are so "],["663.2","if you're with a mission team it takes a "],["664.56","little longer sometimes right a little "],["666.24","bit "],["667.12","yeah a little bit hour longer "],["669.12","so here we are this is a road that's "],["670.72","going up to our house "],["672.64","it's not right by our house but it's the "],["674.079","road that goes up to baguio city "],["676.16","and "],["676.959","you know if "],["678.32","i've been on a windy roads in the states "],["680.64","but it's pale in comparison compared to "],["683.92","these mountain roads my wife and my "],["686.079","daughter you know when they they're "],["687.44","riding this road here they want to fall "],["689.44","asleep because they get dizzy easily you "],["691.2","know and uh so you just you have to take "],["694.48","some stomach medicine especially if "],["696","you're going really fast like some of "],["697.36","these drivers is sometimes it's "],["699.839","driving is different over there than "],["701.519","here in the states "],["703.12","how many times you've been over overseas "],["705.279","a lot of people in baguio city "],["707.519","about 300 000 or so i believe in the "],["709.68","last census "],["710.959","and "],["712.959","it really creates a lot of ministry "],["715.04","opportunity a lot of young people in "],["716.72","baguio city it's a college town "],["719.2","and a lot of people send their kids to "],["720.8","college a lot of universities and "],["722.32","colleges where we live in baguio city so "],["725.04","we see an opportunity to share the "],["726.639","gospel with young people and another "],["728.88","thing in baguio city a lot of "],["730.399","evangelical protestant churches it "],["732.959","probably has the most populated "],["735.04","evangelical churches uh in all of uh the "],["738.079","philippines so to me in our ministry we "],["740.56","our ministry is mainly to evangelical "],["743.279","pastors so we see that it's a great open "],["746.48","door the lord has led us to a place "],["749.44","where we can train and the local pastors "],["752.24","and the work of ministry "],["754.24","through the churches in that place "],["757.04","what is our ministry what is our theme "],["758.8","is to train and teach the word of god to "],["761.519","filipino people in particular our "],["763.519","emphasis is on training and teaching "],["765.6","local pastors who can also train and "],["767.36","teach others in their congregation we "],["769.36","know ii peter 3 18 "],["771.2","a very important verse for

pray that all of "],["781.12","you have trusted in the lord jesus "],["782.959","christ and the gospel for our salvation "],["785.2","but what's next "],["786.72","what do we do after that "],["788.48","is is there commands in scripture that "],["791.12","we follow do you know the word of god "],["793.519","what what are we supposed to do and "],["794.8","that's the reason one of the main "],["796.48","reasons we come to church is to grow in "],["798.56","grace and knowledge of our lord jesus "],["800.079","christ i'm encouraged to hear pastor rob "],["803.6","going verse by verse

"],["1365.919","said yes i can so it really opened a lot "],["1368.4","of doors in baguio and in other parts of "],["1371.039","the philippines there are a lot of "],["1372.799","seminaries that need

because you can learn the greek "],["1384.64","but yet you miss "],["1386.32","uh many different uh valuable lessons "],["1389.12","from the scriptures so what i do is i "],["1391.039","kind of bring it together i try to "],["1393.12","ground them you taking the biblical "],["1394.799","greek language as a tool to ground them "],["1397.12","in the personal work of christ from the "],["1398.96","greek language you can prove that jesus "],["1400.799","christ is god a very god you can prove "],["1403.28","you can see from the greek language in a "],["1405.28","grace salvation apart from works so "],["1408","stuff like that where i bring in the "],["1409.76","theology and the personal work of christ "],["1412.32","using the greek uh language so they "],["1414.96","don't

"],["804.3","some Stones here here we go all right "],["805.68","let's go that's how he is but these guys "],["807.779","aren't like David they're not used to "],["809.519","doing stuff like this they've never done "],["811.98","it before furthermore they don't want to "],["814.32","what do they say we're afraid here in "],["817.139","Judah how much more if we go up to Caleb "],["820.62","it's not just that they're afraid to "],["823.079","fight the Philistines it's that their "],["826.2","afraid period "],["829.019","while they're in Judah they're afraid of "],["831.12","Saul they're afraid of their lot for "],["833.579","their lives "],["834.54","they're with David in hiding because "],["837.26","that's exactly where they want to be "],["839.519","they want to be in hiding and they want "],["841.86","to stay in hiding but notice they don't "],["844.68","feel safe in hiding do they "],["847.38","they were afraid "],["849.48","either way "],["850.92","so if you're going to be afraid either "],["852.779","way then you might as well listen to God "],["855.72","you might as well go stand next to God "],["859.86","you might as well be afraid where he is "],["862.56","as opposed to where "],["864.24","he's not "],["865.56","some people think well I can't go to "],["867.3","church because I'm a mess and I got "],["868.98","issues and I need to get myself "],["870.48","straightened out first before I come to "],["872.16","God but that's not how it works "],["874.56","you need God not because you're good and "],["878.579","mighty and you get something to offer no "],["880.44","you need God because you're weary and "],["883.079","burdened because you're scared and "],["885.12","hurting because you're a mess and you "],["887.699","need help and that's exactly why we need "],["890.76","to pray to him while we need to listen "],["892.32","to him why we need to obey him they're "],["894.779","not going to Caleb because they're "],["896.16","Mighty they're going because they're "],["898.139","scared however God is going to be there "],["901.5","with them "],["902.579","and that's their best option the best "],["905.82","chance of survival is go be beside God "],["909.42","go stand with the one with power and "],["912.18","that way you can feel powerful "],["915.899","just so you know "],["917.76","I'm not serving the lord because I'm "],["920.76","really good and I have all this "],["923.579","talent and ability "],["925.38","I gave my life to God because "],["927.959","I was desperate and I had nothing and I "],["930.959","was good at nothing and I had no options "],["933.18","I had no scholarships going into college "],["935.519","and nobody wanted me nobody saw any "],["938.1","potential in me and when I came out of "],["940.199","college I didn't have any offers and "],["941.88","nobody said oh look at this up and "],["943.32","coming leader what a sharp young man "],["945.18","let's hire him up no I beg to God I "],["949.32","inquired of the Lord help me Lord I "],["951.6","don't know what I'm doing here I've got "],["953.399","no clue I'm weak I'm scared I'm "],["956.16","desperate and God said poor kid why "],["958.38","don't you just come stand over here by "],["959.88","me "],["961.019","so I go where he is and I do what he "],["964.68","tells me to do and I say what he tells "],["966.959","me today say "],["969.3","and then I sound like I know what I'm "],["970.86","talking about "],["972.36","because I'm just doing what he tells me "],["973.8","to do "],["974.699","standing with God "],["976.62","I look better than I really am "],["979.32","so even if you're weak and scared even "],["981.3","if you're broken and suffering if you're "],["983.279","standing next to God you're powerful "],["987","not because of you "],["988.98","but because of him "],["990.72","and let's remember what Paul said in "],["993.18","First Corinthians 1 27 God has chosen "],["996","the foolish things of this world to "],["998.699","shame the wise and God chooses the weak "],["1002","things of this world to shame the strong "],["1005","nobody feels like he's going to Kayla "],["1007.1","they're all scared "],["1008.66","so David inquires again it says in verse "],["1011.12","number four he inquires again now that "],["1014.24","may not have been necessary but it was "],["1015.8","really thoughtful wasn't it "],["1017.36","when the men were scared David could "],["1020","have said quit whining "],["1021.98","I heard from God this is what we're "],["1024.02","doing you bunch of Scaredy Cats "],["1026.78","but instead he takes their concerns back "],["1029.299","to God he takes their fears and their "],["1031.459","weakness back to God because David "],["1033.559","realizes he needs God's help with these "],["1036.679","men "],["1037.819","it's not just about David when it was "],["1039.86","him he would just March out and take on

"],["1051.62","is now part of the equation their sin "],["1054.02","and their weakness their doubt does that "],["1056.9","now affect things God as a leader you "],["1060.14","may have an idea where

"],["1104.66","people but David shows his people that "],["1107","he hears them and that he's sensitive to "],["1109.039","their needs and he shows them that God "],["1111.799","listens to them too

Saul's trying to kill him so uh "],["35.16","David immediately escaped to uhh from "],["39.559","the household of Saul and went to knob "],["42.92","and went into knob and got immediate "],["44.96","help from the priest ALC gave him some "],["48.44","food gave him "],["52.039","the somebody remembers sword of Goliath "],["55.16","and also what did he do for him one "],["56.359","other thing that was important he prayed "],["58.239","for him very good he prayed for him and "],["59.76","then since then David's been on a "],["61.359","journey running around and Saul's trying "],["63.68","to find him uh Saul was very upset that "],["66.96","he he wasn't able to get David so he's "],["69.92","uh "],["72.04","basically freaking out on his servants "],["76.24","and he's manipulating them and do the "],["79.479","Edomite who was at knob the time that "],["83","David was there getting help from the "],["86.119","priests reports back to Saul I saw David "],["89.92","David at KN and then Saul takes his men "],["93.72","marches down to KN confronts the priest "],["97.04","and uh the priest defends himself and "],["99.64","the answer to that was you shall surely "],["101.88","die and then he ordered that all of the "],["104.759","people well all the priest and then all "],["106.64","their families to be destroyed to be "],["108.64","killed and none of his men would "],["111.32","actually do it because his men were I "],["113.52","guess honoring the the law of God and "],["115.399","saying I don't care what the king says "],["116.719","we're not supposed to kill people so "],["118.32","they weren't going to do it but then he "],["119.88","he turns "],["121.079","to do the Edomite and his name means "],["125.439","what yeah that's what it mean watch out "],["128.679","be alert the Edomite so uh do then steps "],["133.04","up and "],["134.48","Slaughters sorry what one Slaughters all "],["138.56","the people that's why you don't sit in "],["140.44","the front row Slaughters all the people "],["143.519","of uh knob and kills the the priests and "],["147.76","their wives and the kids and everybody "],["149.959","even the animals kills them all except "],["153.44","for this one F 22 verse number 20 one of "],["158.4","the sons of MC son of ahitub named "],["163.519","ather they all like the a names I think "],["166.08","that that family AB ather escapes and "],["169.04","fled after David and ab ather verse 21 "],["172.319","told David that Saul had killed the "],["174.28","priest of the Lord and David said to "],["176.36","ather I knew that day when do Edomite "],["180.36","was there that he would surely tell Saul "],["182.879","I have brought about the death of every "],["184.4","person in your father's household you "],["185.879","stay with me do not be afraid he who "],["188.28","seeks my life seeks yours you are safe "],["191.64","with "],["192.64","me so we we were talking last week about "],["196.959","do and Saul and how they were using each "],["199.36","other how everybody's out for something "],["202.48","Saul's using do to do his dirty work and "],["205.48","kill the priest and everyone else at "],["207","knob to send a message to the whole "],["208.599","nation what will happen to people who "],["210.12","helped David and Do's using this dirty "],["212.56","work to get on Saul's good side so that "],["215.159","these guys uh that he could you know get "],["217.12","in good with get in good with the king "],["219.239","so these guys are both getting what they "],["221.2","want but in the meantime let's not "],["223.84","forget that there's a whole bunch of "],["225.159","people who have just been destroyed an "],["227.2","entire town has been sacrificed for "],["229.68","these guys nefarious purposes so you I "],["232.76","think you'd have to ask yourself if you "],["234.239","were do or Saul was that worth it was it "],["238.519","worth killing all those people to get "],["240.36","what we wanted Saul obviously feels it "],["243.68","was a strong leadership decision it it "],["246.4","would make everyone be afraid to cross "],["248.72","him it would make anyone in the country "],["250.439","now afraid to help David which then "],["252.68","ideally would make his life easier to "],["254.319","find David because nobody would be "],["255.56","helping him and he could destroy David "],["257.6","and then destroy the threat to his uh "],["260.12","monarchy so is totally worth it do "],["263.24","thinks hey it's worth it because now I "],["264.72","I've got I'm in good with the King you "],["266.28","know and I'm set because if you're on "],["267.479","the king's good side you know you're in "],["269.24","a place power so I guess it all paid off "],["271.84","for "],["272.84","them after this account if you go hey "],["276.56","let's let's see what happened to do and "],["278.6","I did that this week I wonder what "],["279.759","happened to do there is no more "],["283.16","mentioned in scripture of dog there is "],["285.8","no further story about when David "],["287.52","becomes king brings doy to Justice "],["289.88","there's no good triumphing over evil "],["292.6","there's no happy ending to this account "],["296.32","no knob the the city the town gets "],["298.56","decimated "],["300.12","do gets away with it he gets what he "],["302.4","wants end a "],["305.24","story I don't think I like that ending "],["308.52","that makes me very uneasy where's the "],["311.4","Justice where's the "],["313.68","fairness some people aren't brought to "],["317.56","Justice sometimes the people in power "],["320.4","like Saul have no intention of making "],["323.12","things right they simply want what they "],["325.759","want to accomplish they want their own "],["328.039","personal agendas and sometimes it "],["330.6","doesn't work out that good triumphs over "],["332.36","evil sometimes life isn't fair is it "],["335.12","sometimes people get away with evil and "],["338.4","that's hard to stomach you know we have "],["340.6","these friends in in Northern Virginia "],["342.319","they're from Kenya uh they now live in "],["344.72","in Northern Virginia but they still have "],["346.319","property and family in Kenya uh they had "],["349.28","a big problem because one of the "],["350.88","Warlords in the region basically moved "],["353.639","into one of their properties and took "],["355.4","over just claimed ownership of

but some of the tactics "],["27.279","were positive reinforcement which was "],["29.039","kind of a weird one you went think "],["30.16","positive be a bad thing but it is when "],["32.2","someone's using praise flattery "],["33.879","attention gifts Declarations of loyalty "],["35.559","and love early on in a relationship with "],["37.48","the purpose of hooking someone deeply "],["39.44","bonding them tightly to themselves and "],["41.52","then later they take those things away "],["43.52","and they uh punish people by withholding "],["45.68","those types of things obligation that's "],["48.48","another tactic making people feel "],["50.399","obligated covert or overt "],["53.079","intimidation Saul handling his spear the "],["56.359","whole time he's talking to these folks "],["58.12","as a overt type of manipulation "],["61.239","intimidation lying spitting the facts in "],["63.879","an effort to change someone's "],["64.96","perspective omitting

"],["78.159","most people recognize that they "],["80.64","personally use some tactics from time to "],["83.24","time some of these things there were "],["85.72","others of you who missed this message

"],["110.04","that you did "],["111.6","that point of the message was to have us "],["114.399","evaluate ourselves and our relationships "],["117.68","and see if we're manipulating or being "],["121.039","manipulated the reality is we are all "],["124.24","susceptible to manipulation why is that "],["128.2","why is that because we all have needs "],["131.2","right we all have physical

to 10 and "],["257.12","then we'll go further on later "],["259.16","on Saul heard that David and his men who "],["262.079","were with him had been discovered Saul "],["265.16","was sitting in giba under the Tamaris "],["268.32","Tree on the height with his spear in his "],["270.96","hand and all of his servants were "],["272.16","standing around him Saul said to his "],["274.44","servants who stood around him here o "],["276.919","benjamites will the son of Jesse also "],["279.56","give to all of you fields and Vineyards "],["282.52","will he make you all commanders of "],["284.52","thousands and commanders of hundreds for "],["286.96","all of you have conspired against me so "],["289.84","that there's no one who discloses me "],["291.88","when my own son makes a

lie in Ambush as it is "],["304.16","this "],["305.96","day then do the who is standing "],["310.08","by the Servants of Saul said I saw the "],["313.24","son of Jesse at "],["315.16","knob to ALC the servant of "],["319.44","ahitub he inquired of the Lord for him "],["322.56","gave him provisions and gave him the "],["324.88","sword of Goliath the "],["328","Philistine now do's name in the Hebrew "],["330.919","literally means be anxious be afraid be "],["335.84","careful typically a Bible name reveals "],["339.08","to us something about the character and "],["341.6","Do's name seems to communicate that he's "],["344.199","either someone who is anxious and "],["346.039","fearful or he's someone you ought to be "],["350.16","careful around someone maybe you ought "],["353","to be a little bit "],["354.919","fearful sometimes that person is one and "],["357.96","the same aren't they Saul for example he "],["361.36","was a fearful guy he was plagued with "],["364.36","fear in his own life consequently that "],["366.8","made him very unsafe someone who was "],["369.759","erratic and someone who was irrational "],["372.96","it seems that Saul draws people around "],["376.36","him who are similar to him we talked "],["379.319","about this before that Jonathan David "],["381.52","were drawn together because they each "],["384","had strong faith they were both Brave "],["387.199","and fearless and very principled "],["390.319","Saul on the other hand repels those "],["392.84","types of people doesn't he think about "],["394.919","Samuel the prophet what did he do he had "],["397.199","to leave Saul right David he drives him "],["400.319","away and now we saw Jonathan his own son "],["403.8","sides with David over his father but "],["406.199","instead he teams up the people that get "],["409.12","along well with Saul are guys like do "],["412.919","the "],["415.52","question what are your friends "],["418.28","like who who you connect with says "],["422","something about you are you are the "],["426.199","people that you are around "],["428.52","admirable are they "],["431.039","sane are they honoring respectable "],["433.96","people or like old G Brook saying do you "],["437.28","have friends in low places are your "],["440.68","friends Shady erratic you're rational "],["444.8","you know some people invite drama into "],["447.36","their lives because they're always "],["448.96","hanging out with drama queens some "],["452.68","people are susceptible to manipulation "],["455.68","because they're always hanging out with "],["457.96","manipulative people your parents put it "],["460.919","to you this way you're known by The "],["463.4","Company You Keep now David gives us a "],["466.52","much deeper instruction in Psalms "],["468.72","chapter 1 when he says blessed is the "],["471.08","man that walks not in the counsil of the "],["473.879","ungodly nor stands in the way of Sinners "],["477.96","nor sits in the

"],["491.28","are inviting drama and dysfunction into "],["493.96","their lives simply because of who they "],["496.479","hang "],["497.639","around we don't really know anything "],["500.159","about any of the other people that were "],["501.72","around Saul they're all generically "],["504.319","spoken of as servants or benjamites but "],["507.44","the one guy we do know something about "],["509.12","we do see in action is do the "],["514.159","every time his personal name is spoken "],["517.519","the Hebrew reader would immediately get "],["519.919","a sense of for boing because his name "],["523.959","means be careful look out the "],["529","it's almost like a "],["530.76","little should come into play every time "],["533.72","his name is "],["535.16","said also the fact that he is an "],["538.16","Edomite just that title alone stir up "],["541.36","some emotion in Israel why do you ask "],["545","well let's talk about who the "],["547.16","were the were the descendants "],["549.72","of Esau and Esau was the firstborn son "],["553.2","of Isaac and he had a twin brother whose "],["556.079","name was Jacob and in the womb Esau and "],["560.12","Jacob struggled together and God told "],["562.24","their mother Rebecca that they would be "],["564.32","two Nations she would be the mother of "],["566.279","two Nations and the older would serve "],["569.68","the younger as an adult Esau flippantly "],["573.16","sold his inheritance his Birthright to "],["575.44","his younger brother Jacob for a bowl of "],["578.56","red soup and then he had some buyer "],["582.48","regret and he hated his brother after "],["584.88","that and Esau became the father of the "],["586.519"," and Jacob became the father of "],["589.36","the Israelites and the two Nations "],["592.839","continued to struggle throughout most of "],["595.2","their history I wonder if the "],["597.6","knew the story of ES saw and the "],["600.2","controversy over that Birthright I "],["601.88","wonder if they knew about that you know "],["603.519","that mistrust and hatred can be bred "],["605.519","into a nation can be bred into a culture "],["608.68","very early on and everyone has to live "],["610.399","with the effects of that the name Edom "],["612.92","comes from the semetic word meaning red "],["615.32","and the land south of the Dead Sea is "],["617.839","given that name because of the red "],["619.519","Sandstone that is prominent in the "],["621.279","Topography of that area Esau because of "],["624.72","the soup he traded his b Birthright for "],["627.44","became known as Edom and and later moves "],["630.04","his family to the country with the very "],["632.519","same name so we got the red red play on "],["635.16","words there all going on with this that "],["637.639","the the region the religion of "],["639.639","the is similar to that of all "],["643.24","the Pagan societies they worshiped "],["645.279","fertility Gods Esau's descendants uh "],["648.36","dominated that southern land below the "],["650.2","Dead Sea in Israel and they made their o "],["652.48","their uh their living off of Agriculture "],["654.639","and trade in the ancient trade routs "],["657.839","which ran through the whole region "],["661.079","Mesopotamian region was the King's "],["662.959","Highway and that ran through right "],["665.24","through Edom and when the Israelites "],["667.839","were exiting Egypt and trying to get "],["671.04","into the promised land they wanted to "],["672.92","travel on that highway so they asked "],["674.959","permission if they could travel through "],["676.56","Edom just walk right through on the "],["678.839","highway like everyone else and they were "],["681.6","rejected and they were rejected by force "],["684.36","so that adds to the mistrust that "],["686.519","Israelites and dislike that they have "],["688.6","for they weren't hospitable "],["690.959","they weren't helpful to Israel when they "],["692.639","were in their most dire time of need but "],["695.36","because they were close relatives "],["696.8","because of the whole Esau and Jacob "],["698.639","combination uh you know twin brother "],["701.04","thing they were forbidden in the law of "],["702.72","Moses to hate the however the "],["705.36"," would regularly attack the "],["707.24","Israelites and they had many wars and "],["709.8","matter of fact King Saul had fought war "],["711.519","with the it says back in "],["712.959","chapter 17 I believe and also David "],["715.76","subjugated them when he was the king of "],["718.639","Israel and established military "],["720.48","garrisons in the land of Edom now after "],["724","you get through the Old Testament and "],["726.48","you get uh before you get to the New "],["728.519","Testament you have kind of a age of "],["730.36","Silence they say there from Malachi to "],["732.76","Matthew and uh during that time you have "],["735.8","what is known as the maban era and in "],["738.56","that time the maban era the uh Israel "],["742.56","was able to subjugate the and "],["745.68","they forced them into Judaism and they "],["747.68","ruled over them uh through it all the "],["750.88"," still maintained a dislike and "],["752.88","a hatred for the Jews even though they "],["754.399","were kind of brought into that religion "],["756.6","now when Greece took over the world and "],["758.839","Greek became the common language of the "],["761.88","day the were called "],["765.6","udans udans udans I I'll change it every "],["769.92","service I'll just keep pronounciating it "],["772.279","differently with the rise of the Roman "],["775.199","Empire and E uian who father who was "],["779.76","converted to "],["782.76","Judaism was named the king of "],["785.44","Judah and his name he became very famous "],["788.8","in history and we know the story of him "],["790.32","very well because we tell it every "],["792.04","Christmas time his name was Herod the "],["795","Great this Edomite Udan who became a "],["800","tyrant and massacred all of the babies "],["802.8","in

and then he spins the "],["1080.32","facts we see here in verse number eight "],["1082.88","you've conspired against me there's no "],["1084.64","one discloses me when my son has made a "],["1086.48","covenant "],["1087.36","none of you is sorry for me or discloses "],["1090.64","to me that my son has stirred up my "],["1092.24","servant against me to lie in ambush "],["1094.64","even as it is this way now yes "],["1097.84","it is true that jonathan did make a "],["1099.6","covenant with david but no "],["1101.679","it had nothing to do with stirring up "],["1103.84","david to form "],["1105.36","an ambush against him the covenant had "],["1108.24","nothing to do with attacking saul "],["1110.16","it had to do with david being protected

"],["1131.28","be against you "],["1133.12","is that possible some people have a hard "],["1136.24","time accepting an opposing view it's "],["1139.039","their way "],["1140.08","or the highway it's

allowed his fear his own desires to "],["139.2","motivate him david always seems to do "],["142.08","the right thing "],["143.52","so let's read the verses three through "],["146.16","five and make some observations here "],["148.8","david went from there to mitzvah of moab "],["153.36","and he said to the king of moab please "],["155.44","let my father and mother come and stay "],["157.599","with you until i know what god will do "],["160.56","for me for those who are visiting what "],["162.08","we've been learning in our study is that "],["164.08","david has been anointed the king he's "],["166.08","been serving faithfully uh under king "],["168.239","saul saul uh is uh received message that "],["171.2","the "],["172.08","kingdom is gonna be ripped from his "],["173.44","hands he's fearful he's angry he's "],["176.64","bitter and he knows that david's a good "],["179.28","leader so he's scared of him and he's "],["180.8","hunting him down and he's trying to kill "],["182.959","him so last week we looked at dave in a "],["184.72","cave as he was all alone and then we "],["187.599","learned that his family came to help him "],["189.84","out and he was no longer alone in the "],["192.159","cave but now he's we see here that he's "],["194.48","got to make some provisions for his "],["196.08","father and his mother "],["198.959","and he left them with the king of moab "],["200.56","verse 4 and they stayed with him all the "],["202.72","time while david was in the stronghold "],["205.04","the prophet gad said to david do not "],["206.959","stay in the stronghold depart and go "],["209.04","into the land of judah so david departed "],["211.2","and went to the forest of her "],["215.76","first thing we see david doing "],["218.64","is he takes care of his family last week "],["221.44","we talked about how the family coming to "],["223.76","david and supporting him and we made "],["226.239","that observation and we said that it's "],["227.84","beholden on us "],["229.76","to support our families it's all but a "],["232.4","command for the christian paul writes in "],["235.12","first samuel chapter i mean first "],["236.799","timothy chapter 5 but if anyone does not "],["239.84","provide for his own especially for his "],["242.48","household he has denied the faith and is "],["245.439","worse than an unbeliever it's a tragedy "],["248.72","when people neglect and abuse their "],["250.56","children and don't provide for them "],["252.799","likewise it's a travesty when grown "],["255.84","children neglect their and abuse their "],["258.239","senior parents and don't care for their "],["260.56","needs as well david's family comes to "],["262.96","him "],["264.08","when he was in trouble when he was alone "],["265.6","when he was in the cave "],["267.04","and in turn he now does something to "],["269.919","protect his family and isn't that the "],["271.68","way it ought to work "],["273.12","not how life should be david was raised "],["275.199","by people who cared for him and now he "],["278.24","with those values firmly rooted in his "],["280.16","heart "],["281.199","lives by them and turns around and cares "],["283.28","for his own "],["284.56","it's been a very busy summer with the "],["287.52","mcnutt household and the boys working "],["289.6","and everyone needing to get to different "],["291.44","places at different times "],["293.919","so we've had to do a lot of vehicle "],["295.759","jugglings anybody know about juggling "],["297.52","vehicles "],["298.72","yes some of you know all about that life "],["301.44","and uh it's been a challenging to make "],["304","sure everyone gets to where they need to "],["306.16","be when i was growing up i always had "],["308.08","part-time jobs my father always allowed "],["310.479","me to use one of his cars to get to work "],["313.12","so that's what i learned to do and "],["314.479","that's also what i try to do i encourage "],["316.639","the boys to get jobs i all but mandate "],["318.72","get a job you bum you're not sitting "],["320.32","around the house eating all the food all "],["321.84","summer long get out there and they do "],["323.759","they get the jobs but then that means "],["325.28","i'm gonna have to make sure they get "],["327.12","there so i either have to drive them to "],["328.479","the jobs and or i have to just say here "],["330.56","take the car "],["331.84","and go which means "],["334.639","occasionally "],["336.479","i don't have a car to drive "],["338.8","and that's "],["340","kind of frustrating for you guys that "],["341.84","can relate to me not having a car to "],["343.52","drive when you need to go do something "],["345.199","and on one occasion i couldn't even get "],["347.44","to my softball game "],["349.44","i had to bum a ride so i could get there "],["352.32","because i was the odd man out with all "],["354.32","the cars were in different directions "],["355.68","can you imagine that but you know what "],["356.88","i'm okay with that "],["359.12","because i want to provide for them i "],["361.52","want to help them it's how my father "],["363.84","treated me you know sometimes i think "],["365.44","about how the things that my dad did for "],["367.68","me all the generous things that he he "],["369.84","provided for me and it helps remind me "],["372.319","it helps teach me how to be generous "],["374.72","with my sons but folks sometimes we have "],["377.28","to be flexible "],["379.28","and sacrifice for our families don't we "],["381.84","even though david's in a hard place even "],["383.6","though he has very little even though "],["385.199","he's desperate in hiding in a cave he "],["387.36","still provides for his family he finds a "],["391.039","way to keep his parents safe and "],["393.28","protected and this shows us "],["396.319","priorities doesn't it it teaches us "],["398.96","priorities we live in a world full of "],["402.319","wonderful things to do all kinds of "],["404.88","exciting interesting things to partake "],["406.88","of and endless choices of what we can "],["409.919","spend our time and our money on it is so "],["413.919","vital that we know how to prioritize "],["417.919","what takes our time and attention who "],["420.56","and what comes first "],["423.039","everything and everybody is going to "],["425.36","clamor for your time money and attention "],["428.16","likewise our own "],["430.319","hearts our own wants our own flesh "],["433.12","that too will tempt us what do i want to "],["435.36","do what what do i feel like doing what "],["437.44","do i feel like not doing maybe i just "],["438.72","won't lay on the couch and do nothing "],["440.56","so friday night we had our missions "],["442","night here at the church and it was a "],["443.28","good night and and uh "],["445.599","the boy's cousin from virginia was "],["447.36","visiting and they've been cooped up in "],["448.56","the house all week so they they went to "],["450","mission night but they really want to do "],["451.28","something fun get out of the house and "],["452.639","do something exciting and i said to tony "],["454.639","well you know i guess we see what movies "],["456.72","are playing maybe we'll go to a movie so "],["458.08","he got online and he found that teenage "],["460.24","mutant ninja turtles was on so like oh "],["462.08","we want to go see teenage mutant ninja "],["464.319","turtles i was like okay well yeah that's "],["466","fine we we can do that "],["469.039","you know after the mission night i was "],["470.639","just kind of tired and i just didn't "],["473.039","want to watch ninja turtles i know that "],["475.039","it's hard to believe "],["477.599","and uh i was sitting in the parking lot "],["479.44","because we went to a dollar store so "],["481.199","they could go in and get contraband "],["483.759","free snack cheap snack anybody know this "],["485.919","life right you you go to a dollar store "],["487.759","before you go to the movie theater "],["488.96","because you all right you're with me "],["491.28","so as they were in there i was like i "],["492.639","don't want to go sea turtles and eliana "],["495.199","uh i called her and i was like hey how "],["497.12","about we just let ricky drive them and "],["500.08","we'll go home and rest and she's like "],["502.16","great "],["503.36","because apparently she did not want to "],["504.96","watch teenage mutant ninja turtles "],["506.56","either i mean "],["507.599","who knew "],["509.84","but you know we so we got home and they "],["511.68","took the car and they went and then we "],["513.279","walked in the house and we're gonna "],["514.719","crash "],["515.919","and what is facing us but a whole "],["519.12","mountain of dirty dishes "],["521.36","in the kitchen "],["523.36","and i just want to go lay down "],["526","but i'm pretty sure eliana is not all "],["527.839","that excited about doing this job either "],["529.839","so "],["530.8","we just "],["531.839","did it together and just had a great "],["535.12","husband-wife bonding time "],["537.36","cleaning the kitchen "],["538.88","and i thought this is typical "],["540.88","kids go and watch the movie and we have "],["542.88","to clean up their messes "],["545.04","but that's what you got to do sometimes "],["547.2","i feel like doing nothing but you got to "],["549.279","do what's got to be done "],["550.88","even when you're not feeling it "],["553.12","priorities right whatever our priorities "],["556.16","what ought to be number one "],["558.399","god "],["559.36","second is "],["560.48","family then we can put work down there "],["563.279","and then after that there's any time you "],["566","go do your own personal thing "],["567.92","after that "],["569.2","god gets first crack at all that we have "],["573.12","because "],["574.24","after all it's it's all his isn't it "],["577.36","right why does he get first crack at my "],["579.44","money because he's the first person i "],["581.2","need to give to "],["583.12","god is the one who provides me with the "],["585.839","strength has blessed me with all that i "],["588.32","have has blessed me to live in this "],["589.76","country has prospered me "],["592.24","and i owe him "],["593.92","furthermore the preaching of the gospel "],["596.959","the declaration of the word of god the "],["599.519","saving of souls is the most important "],["602.64","thing in the world can we at least agree "],["604.56","on that amen it's not saving souls the "],["607.2","most important thing in the world jesus "],["609.68","gave his life to save me and you the "],["612.72","least we can do is give 10 "],["615.279","to help support the ministries that "],["617.2","spread the gospel "],["618.399","to other people god ought to be "],["621.279","first and foremost secondly then i would "],["623.6","say family "],["624.959","now of course we have to provide for our "],["626.48","families in our household so that means "],["628.56","we have to work so work has to get up in "],["631.12","there as well we have responsibilities "],["633.44","to our employers but we can't let work "],["635.76","monopolize all of our time and energy "],["637.76","either we have to balance time time with "],["640.56","family and time with work now i "],["642.72","recognize all that is not in first "],["644.64","samuel chapter 22 but david's providing "],["647.6","for his family is "],["649.68","that's the principle i'm just broadening "],["652","the application so it can "],["654.88","resonate with us i'm pretty sure none of "],["656.959","you had to smuggle your family into moab "],["659.04","this week in order to provide "],["660.959","keep them from dying so uh we're "],["662.64","broadening the application to fit us but "],["665.36","david's provision for them is to get "],["667.519","them to moab he takes them to mitzpa "],["670.48","in moab now mitzvah is means watchtower "],["674.079","the name communicates watchtower "],["675.68","communicates what to you a "],["677.68","fortified city right "],["679.6","a fortified city a safe place now why "],["683.12","does he take them to moab why not some "],["685.519","other country "],["687.44","how did you know that was going to be "],["688.64","safe well "],["690.16","think back with me jesse's father is "],["693.76","obed "],["694.88","and obed's father was "],["697.279","boaz and boaz's wife was "],["700.24","ruth and ruth was from "],["702.959","moab there you go jesse's grandmother "],["706.8","ruth is a moabite so jesse's "],["709.68","part moabite "],["711.839","so chances are they still had some "],["713.519","family connection down there in moab and "],["715.6","maybe they went down there for "],["717.36","thanksgiving or new years or something "],["719.04","like that you know they go down there "],["720.8","and visit with the family "],["723.2","but david couldn't just send them down "],["725.279","their incognito you notice the detail "],["727.92","here is that he talks to the king of "],["730.079","moab and gets permission the king then "],["733.12","permits his "],["735.2","mother and father to come down there why "],["737.12","does he need the king's permission "],["740.399","well i think logically is that there "],["742.16","could be repercussions right king saul "],["744.88","may hear that their mom and dad are down "],["747.44","there and he might bring the whole army "],["749.279","down there and try to start something in "],["750.88","order to round up david's parents and as "],["753.36","a way of getting at david as a way of "],["755.36","getting some sort of revenge and if the "],["757.2","king of moab doesn't know that they're "],["759.44","there and didn't agree to let them come "],["761.44","in then perhaps he would just give them "],["763.92","over to saul so in order to avoid a "],["766.16","conflict i mean why would we fight to "],["767.92","defend these foreigners let's just give "],["769.839","them to saul they're his people and he "],["771.36","can take them back and go away but "],["773.44","because david showed respect and he gets "],["776.32","permission then the king of moab agrees "],["779.2","now perhaps the king knows about the "],["781.839","family ties with david and he feels some "],["784.16","obligation to be helpful to a fellow "],["786.24","moabite "],["787.6","or perhaps he wants to support someone "],["789.92","who's giving king saul a hard time we "],["792.32","had observed in previous chapters that "],["794.399","david when he went in the land of "],["795.6","philistines was famous he was known as a "],["798.16","leader outside of the nation of israel "],["800.079","so maybe king moab is doing a political "],["802.88","move here to try to uh help uh one of uh "],["806.48","saul's adversity adversaries but "],["808.48","whatever the reason he agrees to help "],["810.32","david out and give sanctuary to his mom "],["812.88","and dad it's good to get permission "],["816","it's "],["816.8","best to ask before imposing on people "],["820.16","it's also the law of the land "],["823.44","that you are given permission before you "],["825.68","take up residency in somebody else's "],["827.92","country "],["830.24","now some people don't see it that way do "],["831.76","they "],["834","but we are a nation of laws and a "],["837.04","respecter of laws and if people are "],["839.199","allowed to just break and ignore our "],["841.44","immigration laws to get here why would "],["843.519","they respect any other laws that are on "],["845.92","the books "],["847.36","we had "],["848.639","we personally had to invest a lot of "],["850.72","time and money and likewise faith bible "],["852.88","church invested a lot of money in order "],["855.04","to get our family here to gain legal "],["858.24","status in this country "],["860.32","that was the right thing to do we didn't "],["861.839","just smuggle us across the canadian "],["863.6","border and stickers in here "],["865.68","you know canadians they all look alike "],["868.72","we had to go through it all do all the "],["870.56","proper channels "],["872.079","so we see david acting with wisdom doing "],["875.12","the right thing "],["876.639","now the third wise thing that we see "],["878.32","david doing here in verse number five is "],["880.48","he listens to the messenger of god "],["884.959","it says in verse number five the prophet "],["886.959","gad said to david do not stay in the "],["889.92","stronghold depart and go to the land of "],["892.079","judah so david departed and went into "],["894.56","the forest of her wreath "],["897.519","has mentioned briefly four times in the "],["899.199","bible he's called the prophet "],["901.519","in in first chronicles 21 9 he's called "],["904.72","david's seer "],["906.88","a seer's job was to speak god's word to "],["909.68","the people and also to the king a seer "],["912","is not really any different than a "],["913.44","prophet often the titles are used "],["915.199","interchangeably like it is in gad's case "],["917.76","it may be that the seer had a little "],["920.32","more political connection "],["922.959","like a official position with "],["925.76","that he was given "],["927.279","with the king he's not just any old "],["929.279","prophet or any old seer he's titled "],["931.68","david seer you know he's officially "],["933.839","david's seer however "],["936.48","their job is to advise and inform the "],["939.12","king of what they heard and what they've "],["941.519","seen from the lord "],["944.079","and it wasn't always good news "],["946.639","often "],["947.6","it was a message that was very unpopular "],["950.32","and the kings didn't like "],["952.24","to receive the message and consequently "],["954.24","they didn't like "],["955.36","the messenger in second samuel gad "],["959.04","delivered a message to david a message "],["961.279","of punishment that he was going to "],["963.12","receive for numbering the people in some "],["965.759","act of disobedience and david did not "],["967.44","like that message at all nevertheless he "],["969.44","had to accept "],["970.88","what the messenger was saying "],["972.72","but david did that because he was wise "],["974.48","he would listen to the prophets not all "],["975.92","the kings did that did they jesus "],["977.839","lamented in matthew 23 37 jerusalem "],["980.72","jerusalem who kills the prophets

"],["505.08","and uh it's been a blessing it's been uh "],["507.919","a challenge as it says that "],["509.96","as it said there but uh it's been a real "],["512.039","blessing we went over there goal was to "],["515","share the gospel again medicine is not "],["518.039","the ultimate goal over in Togo to our "],["521.36","agency the ultimate goal is to use "],["523.719","medicine as an open door to meet "],["525.72","people's needs physically and then gain "],["528.519","their trust so that we can share the "],["529.92","more precious Medicine of all and that's "],["532.48","the Gospel of

still "],["1191.76","have as sinful nature we need to "],["1194.24","remember that we are only going to be "],["1196.96","made righteous up in "],["1206.52","heaven all right so again at the cross "],["1212.44","we died to "],["1213.88","sin okay Christ died for our sins we "],["1218.799","died to sin that means we again died to "],["1222.96","sin we were "],["1224.6","buried and we arose again and the old "],["1228.28","nature that sin nature was crucified "],["1231.039","crucified does not mean "],["1234.28","killed people normally died from being "],["1236.919","crucified that was the

"],["1249.919","that so what happened at the cross "],["1252.2","number one if you ask everybody who you "],["1254.559","know what happened to the Cross Christ "],["1256.559","died for my sins that's salvation we "],["1259.64","accept that we believe in that we "],["1261.28","receive in faith and trust that Christ "],["1264.039","did that for us that's "],["1266.28","salvation but we tend to

with "],["1278.76","Christ we tend to forget I mean it's "],["1281.32","almost I don't like the but I use it "],["1284.279","cheap Grace people think ah I'm saved "],["1287.84","but then they go on and living like the "],["1289.72","world and I think that we as Christians "],["1292.12","need to realize that we not only have "],["1294.88","the responsibility to live for Christ "],["1297.4","but we have the joy to live for Christ "],["1300.76","that's what really makes things happen "],["1302.799","that's what when Mark was "],["1305","saying God wants us as his church to be "],["1310","the

"],["1362.44","that we receive a gift but we have "],["1365.76","nothing to earn that gift we only "],["1368.44","receive it but after we are saved we "],["1371.12","have a choice we have a choice to either "],["1373.36","to be led by the Holy Spirit or to be "],["1376.24","influenced by the old self therefore "],["1379.279","Satan if we're led by the Holy Spirit "],["1383.039","then we are

and said to him why are "],["252.56","you alone and no one is with "],["256.199","you and David said to IMC the priest the "],["259.44","the King has commissioned me with a "],["261.84","matter and

"],["270.639","young man to a uh a certain place yeah "],["273.8","yeah that's what I did now therefore "],["276.96","what do you have on hand give me five "],["279.08","loaves of bread or whatever you can be "],["281.199","found the priest answered David and said "],["283.44","there is no ordinary Bread on hand but "],["285.479","there is consecrated bread if only the "],["287.8","young men had kept themselves from women "],["289.6","David answered the priest and said to "],["290.88","him well surely women have been kept "],["292.32","from us as previously when I was s out "],["295.28","and the vessels of the young men are "],["296.56","holy though it were an ordinary Journey "],["298.8","how much more then today will their "],["301.199","vessels be holy so the priest gave him "],["304.16","consecrated bread for there was no bread "],["306.919","there but the bread of presence which "],["308.72","was removed from before the Lord in "],["310.759","order to put hot bread in

"],["323.68","of Saul's "],["325.72","Shepherds David said to "],["327.919","IMC now is there not a spear or sword on "],["331.759","hand for I brought neither sword nor "],["334.08","weapon with me because uh the king's "],["336.759","matter was urgent and the priest said "],["338.88","the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom "],["341.319","you killed in the valley Ela behold it "],["343.479","is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod "],["345.759","if you would take it for yourself take "],["347.44","it for there is no other except it here "],["349.639","and David said there is

this not David the "],["362.08","king of the land did they not sing of "],["364.919","this one as they danced saying Saul has "],["368.12","slain his thousands and David his 10 "],["371.56","thousands David took these words to "],["373.479","heart and greatly feared aish king of "],["375.16","gas so he disguised his sanity before "],["378.4","them he acted insanely in their hands "],["380.84","and

people "],["410.44","watch over for him once he started "],["412.44","serving the king everyone in the nation "],["415","loved him he had lots of attention he "],["417.84","was a leader and there was

"],["440.12","obvious to IMC the high priest that "],["442.72","something's not right with this picture "],["444.96","and he says to him why are you "],["448.08","alone why is is there nobody with "],["452.24","you why are you alone that's a good "],["456.12","question last week we talked about being "],["458.56","a loyal friend and having loyal friends "],["461.16","we talked about loving and

not loving and serving others "],["475.68","chances are you are not a loyal friend "],["478.159","and you haven't been able to develop "],["479.68","Intimate Relationships consequently you "],["482.319","are "],["483.919","alone I know a fell who in the past year "],["486.72","has managed to lose all of his "],["488.319","relationships his wife left him his kids "],["491.28","went to

"],["500.12","employers that wanted to keep him on or "],["501.919","keep him around his own mother said to "],["504.319","him I'm done with you I've got nothing "],["507.319","left to

still couldn't get what I "],["527.519","was trying to say to him when I was "],["529.44","talking to him about faithfulness to God "],["531.88","commitment to coming to church learning "],["534.56","and "],["535.44","changing and evaluating himself he "],["539.56","couldn't hear me he just mumbled about "],["542.36","how everyone abandoned him and he was "],["544.16","all "],["545.12","alone but being "],["547.32","alone was a "],["549.399","symptom wasn't it wasn't the problem it "],["552.519","was a symptom of bigger issues things he "],["556","does which drives people away and until "],["559.04","those behaviors are "],["561","addressed that state of loneliness is "],["563.6","going to continue find it quite telling "],["566.16","when people fight and battle with others "],["568.839","they claim to love and after they drive "],["570.72","them away they complain they complain "],["572.2","about being lonely and nobody loving "],["573.92","them however if you look at 1 "],["576.519","Corinthians chapter 13 which I read "],["578.6","often to many many people and we talk "],["581.24","about it often around here don't we what "],["583.04","does Corinthians say love is patient and "],["584.959","love is kind and it is not jealous and "],["588.279","it does not brag it's not arrogant it "],["590.44","does not act unbecomingly it does not "],["593","seek its own it's not easily provoked it "],["595.72","does not keep records of wrong it does "],["597.959","not rejoice in unrighteousness it "],["599.56","rejoice in truth it bearss all things it "],["601.04","believes all things hopes all things it "],["602.839","endures all things and I tell them that "],["605.839","definition of love and very little of "],["608.32","that are they practicing how can you "],["610.64","claim to love someone when you do the "],["612.959","opposite of what defines love you don't "],["616.48","love them you love you and you want "],["619.48","people to love you but you aren't "],["621.36","willing to actually engage in the act of "],["624.24","loving and that will wear people out "],["627.44","that will make them want to get away "],["629.04","from from you my grandmother stayed with "],["633.04","my grandfather for "],["635","years she W uh he was an "],["638.48","alcoholic he was verbally and "],["641.12","emotionally "],["642.36","abusive he wasn't all bad he did have "],["644.92","some very interesting qualities and you "],["647.959","know I'm sure there were things she "],["649.88","could have did better and said better "],["651.8","and she she had her own flaws too but "],["655.2","she gotten sick and her she was tired of "],["658.24","the fighting so she eventually moved out "],["660.519","and got into a little senior's complex "],["662.2","retirement complex and left him in the "],["664.92","home what was sad is that he would call "],["667.079","her every week he got her number somehow "],["669.399","and he call her every week and tell her "],["671.279","how much he loved her and beg her to "],["673.2","come home then a half an hour later he "],["675.68","call her and curse her so you "],["678.519","know his words didn't really ring true "],["682","his actions did not match what he said "],["687.2","there was void in the meaning of his "],["689.56","statement of love so this is one part of "],["692.8","the equation "],["695.8","sometimes something for us to think "],["698.519","about is that we might be "],["701.519","alone because of the toxic environment "],["704.839","that we are creating that people can't "],["707.24","live in now the other side is that we "],["710.279","may be alone because we have to walk "],["712.24","away from someone who has created a "],["714.2","toxic environment such is the case with "],["716.36","David right I mean he had friends he had "],["718.079","family he had a wife who loved him he "],["720.839","was leaving because his father-in-law "],["724.24","was going to kill him so David's "],["726.079","loneliness here is not his fault and "],["729.24","perhaps your loneliness is not your "],["731.079","fault it would be convenient to Simply "],["733.92","apply David's scenario to ourselves I'm "],["736","just like David you know I'm alone "],["737.839","because I'm the victim everyone else "],["739.959","just hates me and they want to kill me "],["742.079","that would be simple and tidy wouldn't "],["743.72","it probably an overstatement we have to "],["747.199","honestly evaluate am I alone because "],["749.199","people want to kill me if I stay or "],["751.04","because maybe I'm doing something to "],["752.399","drive people away I suspect most of us "],["754.44","it's not a life and death situation we "],["756.48","may be unhappy we might dissatisfied "],["758.639","there might be some anger and bitterness "],["760.399","but probably most of us are not in a "],["762.24","life and death if you are leave I "],["764.519","recommend you follow D's example there "],["767.32","most of us are probably much like my "],["768.76","grandparents at two sides and both "],["770.8","parties uh could work on it but perhaps "],["773.36","we're too stubborn to do our part why "],["775.839","are you alone David the priest asks and "],["778.6","what does David would "],["780.079","say he says well you know the King has "],["782.48","commissioned me and the "],["784.16","matter said to me don't tell anyone what "],["786.839","the matter is how convenient I'm sending "],["789.76","you and this commissioned you and and "],["792.12","I've directed the young men to go to a "],["794.16","certain place didn't say the place just "],["796.16","you know a certain place that's it "],["798","somewhere what's David doing there you "],["801.44","think he's "],["802.76","lying "],["804.56","yeah this is uh very common when you're "],["809.16","you're alone it's hard to trust it's "],["812.04","hard to open up it's hard to tell the "],["813.839","truth because often people are afraid "],["815.639","and I think David's afraid here he needs "],["818.32","some help but he doesn't want to explain "],["820.32","the situation he's trying to you know "],["822.76","fly low under the radar he doesn't want "],["824.519","sa to know where he is so he just lies "],["826.88","to the priest I'm not alone yeah I I've "],["829.72","got men with me they're yeah you know "],["832.68","someplace and uh we're on a secret "],["836.12","secret covert uh urgent Mission yeah "],["839.56","yeah that's "],["840.839","it now some commentaries interpret this "],["843.6","passage that David said there was some "],["846.04","men with him so he did have some in fact "],["848.399","have some men with him he must have had "],["850.519","a group but I don't agree with that "],["852.8","because none of the rest of the details "],["854.759","in this passage indicates that he has "],["857.56","any group of people with him when you "],["859.24","look at chapter 20 he was with Jonathan "],["861.639","by himself and he was hiding by himself "],["863.92","and then he left right and then when you "],["866.36","see what happens in 21 where he goes to "],["868.44","the Philistines there's no mention of "],["870.12","any other group and he's acting crazy "],["871.759","because he's scared right and he's he's "],["873.959","trying to you know get out of there "],["875.88","without losing his "],["877.519","head so um I I then you see in verse "],["882.079","chapter 22 that is when actually some "],["884.639","guys come and join him so right now I "],["886.959","think that it's pretty clear that he was "],["889.24","alone and he was just lying now "],["892.12","sometimes we will see people in "],["893.48","scripture who do things wrong like lying "],["895.6","about stuff and we are tempted to "],["897.759","conclude well because of the situation "],["901.44","and because we know David's the good "],["903.16","guy it was okay for David to lie it was "],["906.8","necessary because he was in a tight spot "],["908.839","and the answer to that rationalization "],["911.519","is no no that's not what this is "],["914.759","teaching us it's not okay to lie this is "],["918.92","n this is a narrative passage historical "],["921","literature recording the facts not "],["923.72","telling you do this just this is what "],["926.639","happened so even though it worked at the "],["928.6","moment it does not work out for the best "],["931.959","and we're going to learn that when we "],["932.959","get into chapter 22 next week ALC and "],["935.12","the priest and their families all get "],["936.959","slaughtered because they helped David "],["939.04","well well that wasn't David's fault he "],["940.24","didn't slaughter them yes but at least "],["942.68","had they known the truth then they would "],["944.399","have had the opportunity to decide do I "],["946.36","want to risk my life and they didn't get "],["948.839","any choice at all in that maybe they "],["950.68","would have helped in many ways maybe not "],["952.759","David's lie though my point is is "],["954.759","David's lie has some unintended "],["957.92","consequences likewise our lies which "],["961.319","often we tell for our own good or "],["963.68","somebody else's own good may have "],["967.16","unforeseen unintended consequences ah I "],["969.839","don't want my wife to know about this it "],["972.48","only hurt her just going to make a big "],["975.519","mess let's just avoid this drama s the "],["978.72","rug and it all go "],["981.16","away usually it doesn't go away does it "],["983.839","usually it all comes out and it creates "],["985.68","more drama and we end up with unintended "],["989.639","consequences if you're lying to yourself "],["992","about why you're alone without a doubt "],["995.279","you're just prolonging your state of "],["998.36","loneliness blaming everyone else and not "],["1000.959","admitting your part is just keeping you "],["1003.759","stuck in the same crazy cycle you know "],["1007.44","crazy cycle is you do the same thing "],["1009.12","over and over and expect different "],["1010.639","results but it doesn't work that way "],["1013.44","keeps working out the same way that's "],["1015.12","crazy David lies because he needs "],["1018.279","something what does he "],["1019.44","need he needs food what else he needs a "],["1024.52","weapon I think that right there should "],["1026.76","have been an indication to the priest "],["1028.4","that he was lying I mean what captain of "],["1030.72","the Guard goes anywhere without a weapon "],["1033.039","and furthermore who what guy would go on "],["1035.919","a journey without a lunch I mean I don't "],["1037.959","even come up to work for the day without "],["1040","packing a lunch if I was going on a "],["1042.079","journey we go grocery shopping we make "],["1046.439","snacks and lunches and meals like you "],["1049.44","know hey are we going to stop at a "],["1051.08","restaurant what of course not we're not "],["1053.6","wasting money there we're going to pack "],["1055.16","a lunch FES up the whole car but it's "],["1058.16","worth it I'd venture to "],["1061.84","say probably David doesn't even have any "],["1064.039","money I mean you think about it he took "],["1065.6","off in a panic right doesn't have a "],["1067.039","weapon probably didn't have any money "],["1068.6","either when we make knee-jerk emotional "],["1071.559","decisions we rarely have time to plan or "],["1074.52","think through all that we're going to "],["1075.64","need

"],["1199.679","right here David has as much right to "],["1202.039","that sword as anyone right that would be "],["1204","logical so David's like yeah I'll take "],["1206.919","that and he gets what

did you catch it in verse 7 just out "],["1219.64","of the blue it says oh by the way there "],["1221.76","was a servant of Saul there detained for "],["1223.72","the Lord his name was do the

to be "],["1258.28","safe for them but as we noticed it only "],["1262.559","makes matters worse because at least in "],["1265","Israel they've got the customs of "],["1267.84","hospitality and he's got family and he's "],["1270.88","got people that admire him and uh he's "],["1275.039","really only gotta stay away from one guy "],["1277.12","right I mean everyone else kind of likes "],["1278.4","David but he's got to stay away from "],["1279.76","Saul but when he goes to the Philistine "],["1281.76","territory he's got no friends no allies "],["1284.72","he's carrying the weapon of their great "],["1286.96","Fallen Hero "],["1289.52","that's maybe wasn't such a wise choice "],["1291.48","after all he's uh he's famous because "],["1295.72","he's killed thousands of their

and so he's in a lot he's in "],["1314.799","he's out of The Frying Pan Into the Fire "],["1317.32","here as he goes over to "],["1321.039","Gap David has to think on his feet and "],["1324.4","he

"],["1368.08","we wonder what is wrong with them why do "],["1370.84","they act like "],["1372.36","that sometimes it's because they're "],["1375.72","alone and they have nobody to help "],["1378.84","balance them to advise them to tell them "],["1381.559","to stop acting like an "],["1383.84","idiot sometimes you have to love someone "],["1386.64","enough to tell them that you are being a "],["1388.72","big idiot if you've got friends who will "],["1391","confront you and tell you you're wrong "],["1392.76","don't get angry at them and walk away "],["1395.12","from them they are your good friends "],["1397.64","most people don't like confrontation and "],["1400.96","they will avoid it as much as possible "],["1403.64","and for a friend to actually step up and "],["1405.72","confront you and tell you you're wrong "],["1407.44","means they probably really do care a lot "],["1410","about you if they didn't they would just "],["1411.4","ignore you and leave you by yourself "],["1414.799","sometimes you've got to be firm and "],["1417.279","you've got to tell people that their "],["1418.72","behavior is not acceptable lots of young "],["1421.12","people are growing up with nobody to "],["1423.2","tell them their behavior is not "],["1424.799","acceptable so they really don't know how "],["1427.559","to conduct "],["1429","themselves they dress or they look or "],["1431.44","they act or they talk crazy they're "],["1433.72","screaming for attention "],["1436.4","or they're doing stuff deliberately to "],["1439.44","push people away from them they're maybe "],["1443.279","they've gotten hurt by the people that "],["1444.88","were close to them so they do crazy "],["1446.76","things to sever those relationships it's "],["1449.559","a defense mechanism it's intended to "],["1452.32","keep people away because they're afraid "],["1455.44","of getting hurt that's exactly what "],["1458.2","David's doing isn't he he's pretending "],["1460.279","to be crazy so that they will leave them "],["1463.12","alone and actually in the Philistine "],["1466.44","culture the Philistines Bel that people "],["1469.6","who were insane that was a result of a "],["1472.6","specific Act of God they assumed that "],["1475.08","that crazy person had contact with the "],["1477.48","deity and they felt we need to just "],["1479.96","leave them alone so they feared Madness "],["1482.88","and because of their superstitions they "],["1484.64","just would keep a distance from crazy "],["1487.72","people and that's really all that David "],["1489.24","wanted wasn't it he wanted the "],["1490.919","Philistines to leave him alone so he's "],["1492.84","doing this crazy thing on the door and "],["1494.84","he's letting spit run down his "],["1497.32","beard and that was a clear sign because "],["1500.919","you know Robert will tell you the beard "],["1503.12","is a very is a very manly thing isn't it "],["1505.64","Robert it's very honoring to have a "],["1507.24","beard it's in this Philistine culture "],["1509.12","your manhood and and it was honorable "],["1512","and to let you know something defile "],["1514.08","your beard or to spit on yourself they "],["1516.84","would never ever that would be "],["1519","ridiculous to think about doing "],["1520.36","something like that so that would be a "],["1522.52","great

"],["1531.72","and it works for the "],["1533.799","moment but at the end of the day David "],["1536.799","is "],["1537.559","still "],["1539.32","alone and he really needs some help "],["1542.76","here we too need to recognize just "],["1545.559","because someone is looking or acting "],["1547.44","very weird just because they're putting "],["1549.399","up "],["1550.32","walls

"],["43.84","they weren't very good uh this this one "],["46.879","boy uh Daniel guo was just a freshman "],["50.039","and like all freshman he was just kind "],["51.8","of a scrawny kid and when he'd get the "],["54.6","ball he would uh look at the floor "],["57.359","bounce the ball once and then pick it up "],["59.64","and all my basketball people here know "],["61.359","that's the complete

more than anything else he committed "],["81.759","to working on his game he worked as gut "],["84.32","out and in two short years he went from "],["86.64","not having a clue how to play the game "],["88.36","to being the best player in our team "],["90.68","matter of fact he became one of the best "],["92.079","players in the whole division uh he was "],["94.88","only 510 but he played bigger than that "],["97.159","he could rebound he could block shots "],["99.36","and he he could defend he was the "],["101.68","fastest player on the on the on the "],["103.32","court and boy could he

"],["124.2","smallest High School in the entire "],["126.64","province of nosan so we played in the "],["129.44","smallest division with all the other "],["130.959","public schools in division four the "],["133.48","largest schools in the province uh were "],["136.28","division one schools and in our town we "],["139.28","had a big D1 school uh big high school "],["143.16","all Amalgamated

"],["154.76","his senior year he could have switched "],["157.319","schools and played for the D1 program "],["159.36","and you know what be honest with you he "],["161.159","probably deserved it he was the best "],["163.599","basketball player in town and he could "],["165.48","have started for them I'm sure of it and "],["167.08","he would have been able to go and "],["168.56","compete against

"],["177.319","and maybe get offered scholarships at "],["179","the local universities and colleges in "],["181.8","the maritimes but you know what he said "],["183.84","to that coach of that D1 school he said "],["185.959","nah I'm going to stay with my team and "],["189.84","that meant so much to his teammates and "],["191.56","his friends and it meant so much to his "],["195.12","coach the

"],["202.879","check him out our school was his his "],["204.879","team and his friends and uh Daniel was a "],["208.28","great ball player but he was something "],["209.92","more he was also loyal he

champion ship see "],["150.84","I went to Grace College and it's a "],["152.599","really small school you know most of the "],["154.56","people there so everyone comes out for "],["156.959","inter mural so really intense uh there's "],["159.04","a lot of rivalry a lot of trash talking "],["161.56","that goes on there so winning an "],["163.64","intermural Championship is one of the "],["165.48","most prestigious recognitions one can "],["168.76","receive at Grace "],["170.319","College um the prize is a "],["174.2","t-shirt Grace college intermural "],["176.319","championship t-shirt and when people see "],["178.72","you wearing this t-shirt shirt you get "],["180.76","instant status people think wow what an "],["182.92","athlete he was the best on campus at "],["185.239","that certain Sport and um throughout my "],["188.72","four years at Grace I'd never won a "],["190.92","championship until my final year my "],["193.68","senior "],["194.799","year what sport you might ask surely "],["197.76","soccer that's my best sport nope I "],["199.84","actually missed a penalty kick in the "],["202.159","final but we don't we don't have to talk "],["203.56","about that um uh flag football was at "],["207.92","the sport I won my t-shirt and it wasn't "],["210.799","not flag football basketball Evans no "],["213.4","I'm I'm the worst of basketball so what "],["214.599","did I win I won the intermal "],["216.799","championship for Powderpuff "],["219.04","football not as a player but as a head "],["221.519","coach so for those of you who don't know "],["224.12","Powderpuff football is basically flag "],["226.879","football for girls and in the tournament "],["229.28","they had at my school male coaches were "],["230.92","encouraged because well not saying that "],["233","most girls don't know what to do when it "],["235.159","becomes a football but got to be careful "],["237.4","with what I say here but you know it "],["238.959","also adds to the competitive nature of "],["241","the game you get uh guys uh trash "],["243.48","talking back and forth and motivating "],["245.12","the team to Victory and um it said that "],["248.319","those who can't do teach so that's what "],["251.159","I did it's exactly what I did I I looked "],["253.56","apart I had the headset with the "],["255.48","microphone I had my little Playbook that "],["258.12","I made I even had a coaching staff a "],["260.199","defensive coordinator and an offensive "],["262.36","coordinator some of my friends and and I "],["264.759","even recruited a team I drafted some "],["267.6","girls because their talent uh mainly "],["270.32","speed because in flag football Size "],["273.08","Doesn't Matter you're not tackling "],["274.72","anybody it's about speed it's about "],["276.759","getting open as a receiver it's about "],["278.52","getting the flag on defense so as you "],["281.16","can tell I took this fairly "],["283.919","seriously and of course out of the 12 or "],["286.52","so teams that were there my team was "],["290.16","undefeated so my team was undefeated we "],["292.56","won I got my intermural championship "],["295.56","t-shirt you can applaud yeah "],["300.68","but believe it or not there were times "],["302.72","in the "],["303.52","tournament when my when the girls on my "],["305.56","team needed some "],["307.12","inspiration some games were actually "],["309.199","pretty close and sometimes even my "],["311.36","All-Star quarterback make a mistake so "],["314.72","as a coach it was now my responsibility "],["317.44","to give the team a little pep talk kind "],["320.319","of refocus them to help them see the big "],["322.6","picture help them REM help to remind "],["324.24","them of what we're playing for so I'd "],["326.96","huddle them up I'd say hey everyone "],["328.319","listen to me look at me "],["330.919","guys we can win this game all right this "],["333.039","team we're playing they don't have a "],["335.12","clue about what they're doing out there "],["337.28","intermural championship t-shirt is on "],["339.36","the line you can grab it with within "],["342.4","Arms Reach take hold of it do you even "],["344.479","want it and then they rallied and to "],["347.24","make long story short they responded to "],["350.44","my great "],["351.759","leadership and well in the passage today "],["354.639","we will see the Apostle Paul not lead "],["357.56","his Powderpuff team to Victory but we "],["359.96","will see him give a pep talk to the "],["362.84","church at Philippi an inspiring message "],["365.88","to not get complacent in your spiritual "],["368.319","walk he gives a challenge to press on "],["371.36","and a reminder of the great hope that "],["373.96","awaits all citizens of heaven so if you "],["376.639","will turn with me to Philippians 3 we'll "],["379","start in verse "],["381.319","12 and to do a quick review um who is "],["385.319","the author of the book of "],["387.28","Philippians Paul I heard it okay who is "],["390.12","the "],["391.199","audience church at Philippi and if Paul "],["393.52","is writing to the church at Philippi "],["395.16","what genre is this "],["398.52","book a letter or an epistle yeah so why "],["402.759","is Paul writing a letter to the Church "],["405.52","of Philippi what is the main reason for "],["408.08","this "],["411.12","letter encouragement yeah the church is "],["413.24","doing pretty good they're making some "],["415.199","progress and and no one's going too off "],["417.4","the- wall there so it's an encouraging "],["420.12","letter to keep going to press on to reme "],["423.36","and kind of reminder of the hope that "],["425.08","they have in Christ so um let's read "],["428.08","this passage today and and as we read "],["431.44","Paul's motivational message we're going "],["432.72","to learn about what it means to be a "],["434.72","citizen of of Heaven what characterizes "],["437.639","these people and so kind of keep that in "],["439.8","in the back of your mind as we read "],["441.24","today what is this citizenship of Heaven "],["443.919","All About so in verse 12 I'm going to "],["446.639","begin uh Paul writes not that I've "],["449.039","already obtain this or am already "],["451.919","perfect but I press on to make it my own "],["454.72","because Christ Jesus has made me his "],["457.039","own Brothers I do not consider that I've "],["459.4","made it my own but one thing I do "],["462.44","getting what lies behind and straining "],["464.319","forward to what lies ahead I press on "],["466.759","toward the goal for the prize of the "],["468.759","upward call of God in Christ Jesus let "],["472.4","those of us who are mature think this "],["473.879","way and if in anything you think "],["475.56","otherwise God will reveal that also to "],["478.319","you only let us hold true to what we "],["480.919","have "],["481.84","attained brothers join in imitating me "],["485","and keep your eyes on those who walk "],["486.599","according the example you have in us for "],["489.96","many of whom I've have often told you "],["491.72","and now tell you even with tears walk as "],["494.039","enemies of the Cross of Christ their end "],["496.56","is destruction their God is their belly "],["499.28","they glory in their shame with Minds set "],["501.96","on Earthly things but our citizenship is "],["505.08","in heaven and from it we await a savior "],["507.96","the Lord Jesus Christ who will transform "],["510.28","our lowly body to be like his glorious "],["512.959","Body by the power that enables him even "],["515.64","to subject all things to himself "],["518.12","therefore my brothers whom I love and "],["519.88","long for my joy and Crown stand firm lus "],["522.88","in the Lord my "],["525.32","beloved all right amen Paul begins his "],["528","motivational message by saying that he "],["531.24","has not already obtained it or is "],["533.76","already perfect but I press on to make "],["536.68","it my own and I'm going to use Little "],["539.56","Greek word to sound intellectual I have "],["541.68","some credibility here the Greek word "],["543.519","dioko is translated here as press on and "],["546.839","and this word dioko uh it means to seek "],["550.24","after "],["551.12","eagerly to end earnestly Endeavor to "],["554.04","acquire it kind of brings the image of a "],["556.24","runner who runs a race and he's focused "],["558.32","on the Finish Line he's focused on the "],["561.519","prize and I'd probably translate this "],["563.72","word as Chase so Paul is pressing on for "],["566.76","something he's after something he's "],["568.839","chasing faing it he says Brothers I have "],["571.56","not considered to have made it my own "],["574.88","whatever this mysterious it is seems "],["577.959","clear that Paul doesn't have it but he "],["580.279","really wants "],["581.399","it so what is it what is this thing that "],["584.24","Paul will stop at nothing until he has "],["586.88","made it his "],["588.04","own and well the verse prior verse 11 "],["591.2","Paul says that I may know him Jesus "],["593.959","Christ in in the power of his "],["595.64","resurrection and may share his "],["597.72","sufferings it come like him in his death "],["600.12","that by any means possible I may attain "],["602.839","the resurrection of the dead so what is "],["605.88","it that Paul has not yet "],["608.76","obtained what is it Resurrection right "],["612.72","Paul has not yet been "],["615.16","perfected he has not yet received the "],["617.92","prize of becoming like Christ his savior "],["621.16","but Paul is already saved "],["623.24","correct he has obtained eternal security "],["626.48","and salvation in full through through "],["628.839","Jes Jesus's death on the cross we talked "],["631","about that last week I mean last month I "],["633.48","spoke and and why would anyone work so "],["636.44","hard when you already have your Eternal "],["638.56","Destiny "],["640.04","guaranteed what motivates us to as Paul "],["643.6","writes in chapter two to work out our "],["645.6","salvation with fear and and "],["648.12","trembling If he if we if Paul has the "],["651","righteousness of Christ is there really "],["653.519","anything that he hasn't "],["655.12","attained and I think there's kind of a "],["656.959","tricky uh balance here that is difficult "],["659.24","difficult but but very important to "],["661.56","maintain kind of already but not yet "],["665.079","because Paul has already attained "],["666.68","salvation in "],["667.92","full the Philippian church has already "],["670.6","attained that they have it he says in "],["673.04","the opening of The Book of Philippians "],["674.6","1:6 actually one of my f uh favorite "],["677.32","verses Paul said Paul writes and I am "],["680","sure of this that he who began a good "],["682.6","work in you will carry it on to "],["684.8","completion until the day of Christ so "],["686.92","Paul is sure of this reality you can't "],["689.639","be any more clear of "],["691.76","that Paul is resting on what Jesus has "],["694.36","done he's not trying to earn God's favor "],["696.839","he's not trying to pad his resume of "],["699.399","Good "],["701.92","Works however Paul doesn't stop there "],["704.16","and be careful how you how you hear this "],["705.959","but Paul's not happy just being saved if "],["709.2","you will kind of tricky but why not "],["712.32","because though Paul has his eternal hope "],["714.56","and Security even the great Apostle Paul

"],["1086.6","fire how do you get this intensity that "],["1089.2","Paul writes with I "],["1091.64","think just very simply that we need to "],["1094.4","get on our knees and ask the Lord to "],["1096.919","give us this this fire this thirst for "],["1101.159","righteousness to give us the desire for "],["1103.24","Holiness and for the things of him to "],["1104.919","have his heart

"],["1114.96","will be fruitless God's not doing the "],["1116.919","change and God's not "],["1119.24","working and finally I think we also can "],["1121.48","take a note from Paul's uh pep talk and "],["1125.52","forget and "],["1126.64","strain I think too often we become a "],["1128.96","little little too proud of our successes "],["1132.44","you know oh I shared the gospel with "],["1134","that man or I served at that Bible study "],["1136.4","or I led uh the Sunday School "],["1139","um and kind of give us a feeling hey "],["1141.799","we're pretty good you know we can take

that citizens of "],["1163.12","Heaven Chase "],["1166.32","Holiness and in Paul's chasing for "],["1168.64","Holiness it's interesting that he tells "],["1170.039","the Philippians to join in imitating me "],["1174.039","we might think man Paul you're being "],["1175.679","pretty arrogant who made you the the "],["1178.32","model for Perfection everyone imitate me "],["1181.32","I'm the I'm the perfect model but just "],["1184.6","said you haven't arrived yet and here "],["1187.159","you want everyone to imitate you but "],["1188.96","it's important that self- elevation "],["1190.4","isn't Paul's purpose in writing this "],["1191.88","he's telling the Philippians to get on "],["1194.44","board to chase Holiness with the same "],["1196.88","fervor and tenacity that he is "],["1198.679","displaying to not just imitate him but "],["1201.12","to find others who walk "],["1204","accordingly citizens are of Heaven are "],["1207.08","to be "],["1209.039","imitators so I I have a gym "],["1211.679","membership I work out if you couldn't "],["1214.36","tell and um I had a pretty good workout "],["1217.52","routine when I was at college and now "],["1220.76","it's the summer I kind of wanted to keep "],["1222.039","that edge um but the main problem with "],["1225.159","working out in the summer "],["1226.84","is it's the summer and it's kind of "],["1229.4","vacation time warmer weather out it's "],["1233.32","not very motivating to drive to a gym "],["1235.84","and work out but it's especially not "],["1238.24","motivating to go by "],["1240","yourself uh for me to go by myself to "],["1242.36","work out in the summertime is not very "],["1245.159","motivating or a rewarding "],["1247.64","experience well when I was at school I "],["1249.84","had this friend a friend is name was "],["1252.52","Josh ran and this guy was huge just "],["1256.48","ripped out of his mind like working out "],["1258.64","was Josh's life that's what he did for "],["1260.24","fun if that can make sense who works out "],["1262.24","for fun but this was his life he would "],["1264.36","even went to like workout seminars and "],["1266.36","like met these like body builders and "],["1270","and just what he did and um so the "],["1273.039","school was kind of w whining down and um "],["1275.76","I asked Josh if I could you know work "],["1277.64","out with him for a couple times and that "],["1280.32","was where I made my first "],["1282.4","mistake because Josh would text me when "],["1285.159","he would be working out and once I told "],["1286.72","him I would be there there was no "],["1288.679","backing out One does not simply say no "],["1291.84","to Josh "],["1293.08","rad and when we lifted together I simply "],["1296.08","try to follow along with his workout "],["1297.679","routine and I'd try to do the same "],["1299.679","amount of Weights that he did and I'd "],["1301.679","probably move down a little bit to try "],["1303.44","to keep "],["1304.48","up and and the thing about having a "],["1306.64","workout partner who is way stronger than "],["1309.44","you is that you have to try heavier "],["1311.84","weight so you don't look like the "],["1313.4","weakling that you are so you're going so "],["1315.96","much harder to try to keep up and I will "],["1318.12","tell you that Josh pushed me further "],["1320.6","than I had been pushed in in a really "],["1322.12","long time and you know what I lifted a "],["1325","lot more when I was working out with "],["1326.64","Josh than I had when I had gone by "],["1328.72","myself or with weaker workout "],["1331.6","Partners but I imitated Josh he was an "],["1334.72","example to me of how to lift weights he "],["1337.559","motivated and challenged me to go beyond "],["1340.039","what I had gone "],["1342.039","before so Paul likewise is telling the "],["1344.4","Philippians to find people further along "],["1347.48","and their spiritual journey than you "],["1349.44","people that you can "],["1350.72","imitate find people who can mentor you "],["1353.4","and show you how to live this walk how "],["1356.12","how we can live in obedience to Christ "],["1358.96","because if we're honest we'll admit that "],["1361.76","that following biblical examples alone "],["1364.08","is is rather difficult while we're "],["1366.6","called to model uh biblical individuals "],["1369.44","and role models we need real live Flesh "],["1371.84","and Blood people we need real live Flesh "],["1374.64","and Blood Role Models because we need "],["1377.279","people who we can watch we can observe "],["1379.159","and we can interact with and I think "],["1381.76","this is one of the reasons the church is "],["1383.2","so "],["1384.48","important we are designed for community "],["1387.279","and each of us is made to function "],["1388.679","alongside people and we can't get "],["1391.32","isolated I think one of the big tricks "],["1394.08","of of the enemy is to try to separate us "],["1396.48","try to get us alone so there we can be "],["1399.24","vulnerable we're so weak when we don't "],["1401.48","have anyone who has our backs or anyone "],["1403.48","who's pushing us "],["1404.799","forward I think why why do we do this "],["1407.039","church thing it's not a social function "],["1409.76","it's not a fun thing we do once a week "],["1412.559","the purpose it connects us to "],["1413.88","like-minded Believers enables us to push "],["1417.039","each other along in our walks with the "],["1420.24","Lord so I ask you who are you "],["1422.919","imitating you have a spiritual Mentor "],["1425.52","who is actively discipling you actively "],["1428.88","modeling this Christian "],["1431.039","Life Paul says that if we are really "],["1433.4","serious about chasing Perfection find "],["1436.64","people to follow find people to "],["1438.679","imitate this might mean finding someone "],["1441.159","who you say man in five years I want to "],["1443.039","look like that person and asking them "],["1445.279","hey you want to disciple me you want to "],["1446.76","have lunch you want to read scripture "],["1449.72","together it would involve sacrificing "],["1452.08","time and and and opening up to someone "],["1454","being "],["1455.2","vulnerable and I also ask do you do you "],["1457.88","look to be The Godly example that "],["1459.72","someone else will see and try to imitate "],["1462.799","I think I see a lot of Godly knowledge "],["1465.12","and experience people who know a lot "],["1467.96","about God's word and be careful of not "],["1470.84","hoarding all that God's giving you "],["1473.52","keeping it to yourself find someone "],["1476.12","younger that you can just dump all that "],["1477.76","knowledge on because as a church it's "],["1480.159","important that we have examples and we "],["1481.799","are looking to be examples looking for "],["1484.84","people to influence and to push along in "],["1487.279","our "],["1489","journey so we've seen that citizens of "],["1491.32","Heaven Chase Holiness firstly and "],["1494.64","citizens of Heaven imitate Godly "],["1496.799","examples "],["1498.64","lastly we're going to see that citizens "],["1500.08","of

chapter 20 sometime "],["56.239","in July anyways let's read the first 17 "],["60.28","verses and then make some uh "],["62.879","observations and applications "],["64.96","together so David fled from nio in Rama "],["69.36","and came and said to "],["71.72","Jonathan what have I done what is my "],["75","iniquity and what is my sin before your "],["77.32","father that he's seeking my "],["79.88","life this is Jonathan said to him far "],["83.439","from it you shall not die behold my "],["86.439","father does nothing either great or "],["88.04","small without disclosing it to me "],["90.439","so why should my father hide this thing "],["92.56","from me it is not so yet David vowed "],["95.439","again saying your father knows well that "],["97.88","I have found favor in your sight and he "],["100.04","has said do not let Jonathan know this "],["102.84","or he will be "],["104.24","grieved but truly as the Lord lives and "],["107.399","as my soul lives there's hardly a step "],["110.799","between me and death and Jonathan said "],["113.88","to David whatever you say I will do for "],["116.68","you so David said to Jonathan behold "],["119.079","tomorrow is the new Moon and I ought to "],["121.079","sit down and eat with the King but let "],["123.479","me go that I may hide myself in the "],["125.52","field until the third evening when your "],["127.759","father misses me at all then say if your "],["130.479","father misses me at all then say David "],["132.48","earnestly ask leave of me to run to "],["135.36","Bethlehem his City because it is the "],["137.36","yearly sacrifice there for the whole "],["139.56","family if he says it is good your "],["142.8","servant will be safe but if he is very "],["145.64","angry know that he had decided on evil "],["149.239","therefore deal kindly with your servant "],["151.68","for you have brought your servant into a "],["154","covenant of the Lord with you but if "],["157.04","there's iniquity in me put me to death "],["159.12","yourself for why then should you bring "],["161.48","me to your father well Jonathan said far "],["164.64","be it from you for if I should indeed "],["167.2","learn that evil has been decided by my "],["169.959","father to come upon you then would I not "],["172.599","tell it you about it then David said to "],["175.879","Jonathan who will tell me if your father "],["178","answers you harshly Jonathan said David "],["180","come let us go into the field so they "],["181.879","brought them they both went into the "],["183.64","field and Jonathan said to David the "],["185.76","Lord the god of Israel be witness when I "],["189.2","have sounded out my father about this "],["191.4","time tomorrow or the third day behold if "],["193.56","there is a a good feeling towards David "],["196.159","shall I not send to you and make it "],["198.12","known to you if it please my father to "],["201.319","do you harm may the Lord do so to "],["203.56","Jonathan and more also if I do not make "],["206.08","it known to you and send you away that "],["208.439","you may go in safety may the Lord be "],["211.64","with you as he's been with my father if "],["214.239","I still alive will you not show me the "],["217.56","loving kindness of the Lord that I may "],["219.92","not die you shall not cut off your "],["222.28","loving kindness from my house forever "],["224.28","not even when the Lord cuts off every "],["226.959","one of the enemies of David from the "],["228.519","face of the Earth so Jonathan made a "],["231.239","covenant with the House of David saying "],["233","may the Lord require it at the hand of "],["235.2","David's enemy Jonathan made David vow "],["238.079","again because of his love for him him "],["240.28","because he loved him as he loved his own "],["244.36","life okay in chapter 20 we see more "],["247.2","drama between King Saul and David Saul "],["251.84","still wants to kill David and still "],["254.36","David is not too keen on dying but as we "],["257.6","have studied this chapter and as we "],["259.68","study this chapter we're going to see "],["261.799","that the important principles for us to "],["263.96","learn are Illustrated in the actions of "],["267.08","Jonathan Jonathan here you see is is "],["269.88","torn he he sees the drama between his "],["272.68","father and David and he can't sit idle "],["275.56","he's going to have to eventually take "],["277.52","aide he's going to have to make a choice "],["280.479","and then live with those consequences "],["283","live with the outcome but why this is so "],["285.44","hard is because it's between two people "],["287.919","that he loves dearly however they both "],["290.479","can't be right so he's got to evaluate "],["293.4","now he's got to come to a conclusion "],["295.56","about who is right there comes a point "],["299.759","point when all of us have to look at how "],["303.479","we were raised and what we were taught "],["306.199","and we have to ask ourselves is this "],["310.8","right I still remember the first time I "],["313.68","did some critical thinking on my own as "],["316.199","a teenager now how I was raised it was "],["319.72","viewed as a bad thing to go to the movie "],["324.919","theater however it was okay to rent uh "],["330.4","vcr and watch a movie in your "],["333.039","house okay I still remember thinking "],["336.88","about that and of course that was back "],["338.919","in the Dark Ages before DVD players "],["341.24","right when you uh you didn't own a VCR "],["343.919","but you could rent one anybody remember "],["345.199","renting VCR see some of some of you "],["347.44","remember renting VCRs you could rent the "],["349.16","VCR for $10 and the movie for $5 didn't "],["352","really make much sense did it to rent "],["353.88","$10 VCR for one $5 movie so you rent a "],["356.4","couple so for 25 bucks you'd have like a "],["358.4","whole weekends of activities uh three "],["360.44","movies plus a vcr and all the teens are "],["362.479","wondering well why didn't you just watch "],["363.84","movies streaming off the "],["366","internet well I'm talking about when "],["368.199","there was no such thing as the internet "],["371.56","a time when people did not have "],["374.36","computers I just blew all the "],["376.639","35-year-old in under Minds on that one "],["380.28","Once Upon a Time long ago and far away "],["384.16","there was no such thing as the internet "],["386.84","and we rented "],["388.56","VCRs "],["391.44","I know it's "],["392.52","crazy but that's when I remember doing "],["394.88","some critical thinking on my own it it "],["397.599","would be a bad thing to go to the movie "],["399.199","theater but it's okay to rent "],["401.4","movies what's the difference and that's "],["404.36","when I started evaluating things that I "],["406.16","was told to believe I started deciding "],["408.08","for myself is this right or is this "],["410.319","wrong I was told that non-Christian "],["413.12","music was bad all non-Christian music "],["415.08","was bad all of it and uh I listened to "],["419.319","it "],["420.36","and I didn't agree with that some of it "],["423","was bad that was obvious but some of it "],["425.639","they weren't really doing anything wrong "],["426.84","with it so I figured not everything I've "],["429.12","been taught was accurate I would need to "],["431.08","evaluate I would need to investigate I "],["432.919","would need to discern if everything was "],["435.72","legit now it was easier to evaluate when "],["440.28","it came to things that I wanted to do "],["442.599","right I want to go see a movie I want to "],["444.84","listen to the top 40 what's wrong with "],["446.879","it but those were convenient things "],["449.52","things to question I had to be honest "],["451.44","with myself and not let what I wanted to "],["453.84","believe dictate what was right because "],["457.28","that's what I saw some of my peers doing "],["459.4","they let their feelings dictate what "],["461.12","they thought was right or wrong here's "],["462.96","what I would see a lot of the kids in my "],["465","church doing there were kids that "],["467.12","believed what they were told and they "],["469.919","never questioned it and they obeyed it "],["472.12","and they were good okay and uh put you "],["475.44","over here you're the good ones right and "],["477.159","then there was kids who they rejected "],["480.52","what they were told and they snuck "],["481.759","around behind their parents' back and "],["483.199","did whatever they wanted and they were "],["485.479","bad you guys over here right they were "],["489.479","the they were they were doing bad now I "],["491.159","was somewhere right where I am right now "],["493.159","I was somewhere in the middle between "],["494.8","those two sides I I didn't reject "],["497.12","everything simply because I didn't want "],["498.479","to believe it but I could see that not "],["500.44","everything I was being told was adding "],["501.72","up either so I was torn with trying to "],["504.08","do good and still trying to do what I "],["506.56","wanted which I didn't think was all that "],["508.319","bad now for for a while I drifted "],["510.599","towards doing what I wanted and U more "],["514.959","and more and I began to realize that it "],["517.839","it it didn't take me long to see that "],["519.68","blatant Disobedience was going to have "],["521.479","some serious negative "],["523.959","consequences and then as I explored "],["526.519","trusting God in obeying the things that "],["528.76","I knew were right okay I don't have to "],["530.48","go with everything but if I do the "],["532.279","things that I know are right when I did "],["534.399","those I saw that God blessed me and "],["537.32","that's when my beliefs became very very "],["539.8","personal that's when I went from just "],["542.24","Sunday school answers of what I was told "],["544.839","was right and wrong theological "],["547.399","statements or definitions I came to "],["549.92","realize that God knew me that God liked "],["553.64","me that he would use me that he had a "],["556.56","special plan for my life and he had good "],["559.2","things in store for me and once I get my "],["561.399","head around that I've trusted him I've "],["564.839","served him because it's good and it "],["568.24","because it's what I want to do and "],["569.88","that's really cool when both things come "],["571.88","together it's what you want to do and "],["573.279","it's actually good but I know for a fact "],["575.88","that I am not the only person in here "],["577.839","who's had to evaluate their "],["579.76","upbringing and have concluded that not "],["582.2","everything I've learned everything I've "],["584.279","been taught was absolutely right some of "],["586.92","us here would say well you know my "],["588.68","parents were good people and they meant "],["590.56","very well and my church that I grew up "],["592.2","in they meant very well but they weren't "],["593.64","always "],["594.519","right other of us in here have outnot "],["597.72","realized my parents were mess they did a "],["601.12","horrible job uh they showed me so much "],["603.839","that is wrong I have a lot of work to do "],["606.2","to figure out what's right Jonathan's in "],["608.88","that place he wants to do good he knows "],["611.959","his dad's not perfect but he believes "],["614.04","for the most part yeah he's pretty good "],["615.92","guy David on the other hand he knows "],["618.839","that Jonathan's a sincere person but he "],["621.279","knows Saul's out to get me he says I'm "],["624.6","one step away from Death all the time "],["628.839","one step step away so Jonathan has got "],["630.88","to step back and evaluate at first he "],["633.72","disagrees with David did you see that "],["635.32","tone there in verse number "],["637.72","two where he said fire from it you "],["640.399","should not die my father does not do "],["642.56","nothing great or small without "],["644.079","discussing him with me so why would my "],["645.92","father hide this from me it is not "],["648.959","so no David it's all in your head my my "],["652.519","father's not going to kill you yeah he's "],["654.04","threatened you yeah he's threatened me "],["655.56","too you know he wanted to kill me at one "],["657.04","time but I'm still alive yeah he'll get "],["658.72","over it "],["660","that's what dads it's what Kings do they "],["661.839","just threaten to kill everybody all the "],["663.639","time he tells me he hasn't told me he "],["666.36","wanted to put you to death he would tell "],["667.76","me I know everything he's doing it is "],["671.079","not so see Jonathan has this narrative "],["674.04","about his dad doesn't he his narrative "],["675.959","is is I have influence over my dad my "],["678.44","dad listens to me and he talks to me and "],["680.8","the King's not gonna do anything if I "],["682.16","don't know "],["684.32","it "],["685.88","sometimes we think we're in the know "],["688.32","when it comes to people who are close to "],["690.76","us that we've got more say or a tighter "],["694.88","handle on things than maybe we really do "],["699.24","my kids I I got a handle on my "],["701.959","boys yeah they're doing fine I know "],["705.88","we're tight we're tight my financial "],["709.16","adviser well he's really looking out for "],["711","me my my my my spouse my husband my wife "],["714.519","that I know what they're capable of "],["716.32","trust me they would never hurt me my "],["719.8","co-workers they just love me my "],["721.68","co-workers they'd never stabbed me in "],["723.44","the back my friends we're just all like "],["726.079","brothers and sisters they they would "],["727.92","never leave me hanging they would never "],["729.36","bail on "],["730.44","me let me just tell you "],["733.32","this each and every one of the people "],["735.72","that you have great confidence "],["737.68","in is a "],["739.72","sinner each and every person you know is "],["743.72","far from perfect and thus has the "],["746.36","capacity to fail the people you look up "],["750.68","to you trust in you idolize they've got "],["753.639","flaws weaknesses shortcomings and "],["757.16","sometimes they're dead "],["759.32","wrong yeah but Pastor Rob this situation "],["761.76","this doesn't really apply to us because "],["764.32","Saul he he was a bad King he was just a "],["767.519","bad guy no remember what we said about "],["771.079","Saul we said it several times Saul was "],["773.8","complicated and conflicted he was "],["777.079","complicated and conflicted he was not a "],["779.44","King he was ordained by God he was "],["782.68","chosen by God and he raised the Army and "],["786.24","he had success in battle and he defended "],["788.88","his people but he was also a person like "],["792.32","any other person he had weaknesses and "],["794.68","frailties and he was subject to "],["796.959","Temptation now Jonathan isn't naive in "],["799.76","defending his father and doubting his "],["801.56","friend he has seen the good side of his "],["804.279","dad he has seen Saul respond to truth he "],["807.92","trusts his father and he's wants to give "],["809.519","him the benefit of the doubt David on "],["811.16","the other hand has just dodged far too "],["812.92","many Spears at this point in his life "],["815.279","his house was raided while he was "],["816.68","supposedly asleep and he's seen the Lord "],["818.88","the Holy Spirit knock Saul out and still "],["821.68","knows that Saul is going to try to kill "],["824.48","him he needs Jonathan to understand that "],["827.079","he's not making this up so he says verse "],["830.92","number three David bowed this again "],["833.199","saying your father knows well that I "],["834.8","have found favor in your sight and he "],["836.44","has said don't let Jonathan know this or "],["838.48","he will be but truly as the Lord lives "],["840.279","and as my soul lives I am hardly one "],["842.44","step away from "],["846.36","Death Jonathan then agrees well I'm "],["848.72","going to have to give David a chance to "],["850.92","prove it and he says then whatever you "],["854.199","say Jonathan said to David whatever you "],["856.24","say I will do so he's going to listen "],["859.16","Jonathan's going to evaluate and that's "],["861.72","the first step isn't it let's be honest "],["863.68","and look at what's really going on let's "],["866.079","look at this "],["867.72","family and "],["870.32","honest yeah we're just all family we "],["873.639","just all love each other "],["876.399","really is that what's really going on "],["880.839","can we speak the truth in love to "],["883.399","everyone in this family can we serve one "],["885.839","another in love do we have a spirit of "],["889.72","unity are there things that we dare not "],["893.48","talk "],["894.6","about can we speak the truth or are "],["896.68","there things that we dare not talk about "],["898.04","is there chaos fighting resentment is "],["899.759","there awkwardness around this place are "],["902.04","we real or is this just a facade we're "],["904.759","going to have a fun family "],["908.12","vacation really or is it just going to "],["910.72","be a long hellish Drive "],["913.759","someplace I had a lot of long awkward "],["916.16","drives when I was "],["918.12","young I don't know what anybody was "],["920.04","fighting about but I just knew nobody "],["921.759","was talking and nobody wanted to talk "],["923.32","and you could cut the atmosphere with "],["924.759","the chainsaw that's not a fun family "],["928.079","vacation "],["930.399","we're going to get together with the "],["931.759","family this holiday weekend is that if "],["933.959","that sounds like a painful Duty more "],["936.24","than a loving opportunity then your "],["939.56","family's not held together by love now "],["941.88","don't get me wrong I'm not talking about "],["943.44","the crazy drama that families all have "],["945.44","to endure some of our family's best "],["948.16","stories the things that we laugh the "],["949.8","hardest about are the dramatic events "],["951.8","that happen on long drives on our family "],["954.36","vacations like last year for example we "],["956.959","went to Canada as we crossed the border "],["959.6","our AC died now you know what it really "],["962.72","wasn't a big deal when we were in Canada "],["964.12","because it was 62 degrees you know we "],["966.16","didn't even have to put shorts on and we "],["967.56","were just cooling out hanging out with "],["969","the windows open it was really nice "],["971.8","until that last day when we were driving "],["974.72","from Niagara Falls down to Southern "],["977.639","Maryland and that was a long hot sweaty "],["984.079","drive we just had to hold our breath and "],["988.199","gut it out "],["989.839","together and then we stopped for wings "],["991.959","in Buffalo and just added extra "],["995.68","challenges in there spicy wings we got "],["998.639","all that going on for a 10 hours drive "],["1001.88","and we just had to suffer through it and "],["1003.72","laugh about "],["1005.519","it but you know there was no hate or "],["1007.8","bitterness as a result of that nobody "],["1009.519","said I'll never go with you people again "],["1011.56","on a vacation actually the boys say some "],["1013.959","of our best times have been our long "],["1016","road trips together what David is "],["1018.12","talking about "],["1019.519","is if I show up to the feast Jonathan "],["1021.759","I'm going to get killed basically verse "],["1024.4","number 5 through eight David said to "],["1026.52","Jonathan behold tomorrow is the new moon "],["1028.24","I ought to sit down and eat with the "],["1029.48","King but let me go that I may hide "],["1031.839","myself in the field until the third "],["1033.24","evening if your father misses me at all "],["1035.12","and says David then say David earnestly "],["1038.4","asked to leave and run to Bethlehem his "],["1040.24","City because of the yearly sacrifice "],["1042.039","there with his whole family if he says "],["1043.839","he it's good no problem then your "],["1045.76","servant's safe but if he's very angry "],["1048.48","know that he has decided on evil "],["1051.32","therefore deal kindly with your servant "],["1053.039","for you have brought your

so David he's cooked up a test "],["1064.64","for Saul hasn't he to see what his "],["1066.88","motives are if I don't show up and he "],["1068.32","doesn't care you know it's not a "],["1071.24","problem he's not trying to kill me but "],["1073.44","if he's angry that I'm not there then "],["1075.08","that's an indication that he is out to "],["1077","get me and he's mad that his plans have "],["1078.4","been foiled so what's David asking "],["1080.919","Jonathan to do he's asking him just go "],["1082.96","see how Saul acts go mention my name and "],["1085.919","see what

"],["1117.76","to this "],["1118.919","field and then uh so Jonathan is "],["1121.559","basically my father is if he's decided "],["1123.76","to do evil uh I will let you will I not "],["1126.84","let you know about it he's discovered to "],["1128.84","go on this fact finding Mission and find "],["1130.88","the truth and then what we're going to "],["1133.2","see here "],["1135.159","is well let me read it and then I'll "],["1137.08","tell you what this is Jonathan said to "],["1139.24","David the Lord the god of Israel be "],["1142","witness when I have sound sounded out my

"],["1163.88","you away that you may be safe may the "],["1166.6","Lord be with you as he's been with my "],["1169.919","father now what's going on here is what "],["1172.159","you're hearing is classic Covenant "],["1175.64","oath-taking language of the Old "],["1177.64","Testament David and Jonathan don't have "],["1179.559","a lawyer and they're not signing any "],["1182.159","paperwork here but for all intents and "],["1185.159","purposes that's exactly what they're "],["1187.24","doing they're entering into a contract "],["1190","they're entering into a covenant this is "],["1192.2","the second time they've entered into a "],["1194","covenant with one another now with this "],["1196.84","Covenant it will not be the laws of of "],["1198.84","the land that will make it binding or "],["1200.44","the courts of the land or the Elders of "],["1201.84","the land that are going to judge between "],["1203.039","it someone much higher and more powerful "],["1204.96","is going to be the judge or the witness "],["1206.48","and who is that the Lord the god of "],["1209.44","Israel in the Old Testament the "],["1211.48","covenants were always done with God as "],["1214","your witness and that meant if you broke "],["1216.28","that Covenant you were expecting God to "],["1219.52","put a judgment on you now this is very "],["1221.76","interesting when you go over to the New "],["1223.32","Testament and you see how Jesus told the "],["1226.52","uh the people don't be taking Oaths with "],["1228.4","each other "],["1229.76","and he was explaining and and kind of "],["1231.799","refuting what the Pharisees were doing "],["1233.6","in their oath taking because the "],["1235.08","Pharisees the religious leaders of that "],["1236.64","time they would take Oaths but they "],["1238.48","would take them in a very technical "],["1239.919","sneaky way so that they wouldn't be held "],["1242.52","before God on them and they would say I "],["1244.64","swear before the temple or I swear "],["1246.559","before the altar or I swear and they "],["1248.919","would swear on all these things that "],["1250.64","sounded like it was about God but it "],["1252.48","really wasn't they didn't actually name "],["1254.44","God specifically and by not naming God "],["1256.44","specifically they viewed that as a "],["1257.96","technicality that that they could get "],["1259.08","out of the oak so they that was kind of "],["1260.72","a little sneaky thing they were doing "],["1262.159","and God and Jesus said don't do that "],["1264.24","just let your yes be yes and let your no "],["1268.159","be no and just be a man of your word "],["1270.24","right but that's what was going on with "],["1271.96","that and and in the Old Testament they "],["1273.76","were always doing the Oaths before God "],["1276.2","and if you broke it you expected God now "],["1278.24","God himself took an oath God himself "],["1280.08","made covenants and when he swore an oath "],["1282.24","with the Abraham he did it by whose "],["1285.559","name his own name why cu there was "],["1289","nothing stronger and nothing more "],["1291.039","powerful than his own name to pledge to "],["1293.52","now we don't do these types of pledges "],["1295.88","or Oaths before God anymore do "],["1298.84","we do "],["1301.679","we Rusty saying yeah so he's usually "],["1305.039","right well actually we do in our "],["1309.08","Christian weddings we still make vows "],["1313.12","and Covenants before God don't we I "],["1316.279","would like to point out that there's no "],["1318","stronger Val "],["1319.12","than the one you make before God it "],["1321.36","means that you're expecting and "],["1323.039","anticipating the Judgment of God to fall "],["1324.919","upon you if you break "],["1326.84","it that's a sobering reminder for us "],["1329.44","isn't it summertime is the traditional "],["1332.4","wedding seasons and it's always nice to "],["1334.799","go to weddings and attend weddings and "],["1336.6","remember our wedding and how beautiful "],["1339.4","we all looked at that time and young and "],["1341.64","thin and all "],["1343.32","that just don't "],["1345.48","forget the Covenant you made and who you "],["1349.48","made them "],["1350.679","before just like a marriage vow "],["1353.96","Jonathan's Covenant is a

"],["1365.159","more so "],["1366.559","also if I do not make it known to you or "],["1369.2","send you away that you may go in safety "],["1371.6","may the Lord be with you as he is with "],["1374.039","my "],["1374.96","father see Jonathan understands the "],["1377.4","implications of this Jonathan is now "],["1379.72","kind of in a lose lose lose situation "],["1383.52","Let Me

"],["1407.24","dad right and his that could get him "],["1410.44","however if Saul's trying to kill David "],["1414.2","and God is on David's side and judges "],["1418.36","Saul Jonathan realizes that he might "],["1421.279","also fall under that condemnation "],["1424.72","why because he understands that the sins "],["1427.48","of the father pass to the third and "],["1430.52","fourth generations and him being of the "],["1433.84","family of Saul as an enemy of David "],["1436.76","could come under that condemnation as "],["1440.08","well and that's what he's talking about "],["1441.76","here in verse number 14- 16 if I am "],["1444.799","still alive verse 14 will you not show "],["1447.84","me the loving kindness of the Lord that "],["1450.52","I may not die see that's why he's saying "],["1453.44","that if I if if my dad don't kill me you "],["1457.559","show me loving kindness that I won't die "],["1460.159","why would he die if you shall not cut "],["1463.08","off your loving kindness from my house "],["1464.96","forever not even when the Lord cuts off "],["1467.48","every one of the enemy of David from the "],["1469.44","face of the Earth see he understands "],["1471.679","that he would now fall in the category "],["1473.72","as being of the House of Saul the house "],["1475.36","of Jonathan would be an enemy of King "],["1477.919","David and therefore potentially could be "],["1480.919","wiped out because back then in those "],["1482.36","times those monarchs would wipe out any "],["1484.799","threat to them any any claim to the "],["1487.96","throne of these Generations would be "],["1490.52","eradicated so he's saying make a pledge "],["1492.88","with me show your loving kindness verse "],["1495.84","16 so Jonathan made a covenant with the "],["1497.559","House of David saying may the Lord "],["1499","require it of the hands of David's "],["1501.24","enemies Jonathan made David a vow again "],["1504.24","because of his love for him because he "],["1507.159","loved him as he loved his own life so "],["1509.679","Jonathan realizes when the truth comes "],["1511.24","out there could be ramifications for his "],["1513.12","family and that's the very reason why we "],["1515.96","often don't evaluate or confront our own "],["1519.32","family members because we know there's "],["1521.279","going to be ramifications consequences "],["1524","that maybe we don't want to have to "],["1525.559","suffer through things could get messy "],["1527.76","people could get really upset maybe we "],["1530.279","better not say anything maybe we just "],["1532.12","better keep the rug covered over all "],["1534.08","that mess maybe we better just keep all "],["1535.919","that stuff stuff back in the closet here "],["1538.52","Let's ignore the "],["1540.64","situations and just hope it all goes "],["1543.64","away but that's not what Jonathan's "],["1545.679","doing he's brave enough to confront his "],["1548.08","father he's prepared to trust God with "],["1550.679","the outcome let God be the judge he also "],["1553.679","trusts that David who has been shown "],["1556.12","that he's filled with the spirit of the "],["1557.48","Lord that David has Illustrated Truth "],["1559.559","and Love in the past David will keep his "],["1562.279","word and will continue to show loving

"],["1576.6","other in that Lov and kindness "],["1578.679","relationship that he won't treat them "],["1580.64","the way Saul has treated them one of the "],["1583.48","hardest things for "],["1585.279","me was to have to confess something to "],["1587.799","my dad "],["1589.399","I never wanted him to be angry at me or "],["1591.12","disappointed with me and of course I "],["1592.84","didn't want to get into trouble but you "],["1594.52","know as I got older I learned that my "],["1596.64","dad was the best person to confess to "],["1599.52","because he had shown me that he would "],["1601.52","forgive me that he could probably help "],["1604.279","me with whatever I was in trouble with "],["1607.08","and that he loved "],["1608.6","me he had this loving kindness

and stayed at "],["684.36","Nao it was told Saul saying behold David "],["687.079","is at Nao with RA in Rama "],["689.48","Saul sent Messengers to take David but "],["693.32","when they saw the company of the "],["694.959","prophets prophesying Samuel was standing "],["697.44","there and priding over them the spirit "],["699.72","of the Lord Came Upon The Messengers of "],["702.68","Saul and they also prophesied I was told "],["706.16","Saul he sent some other Messengers and "],["708","they also prophesied so Saul sent some "],["709.959","other Messengers and again the third "],["711.56","time they also prophesied and he said "],["713.72","himself he and then he he himself went "],["716.76","to Rama and he came as far as the large "],["719","DW that's at sakur and he asked and said "],["721.44","where is Samuel and David and someone "],["723.2","said behold they are in Nao of Rama he "],["726.72","proceeded to go to neama and the spirit "],["729.2","of God Came Upon him also so that he "],["731.72","went along prophesying continually until "],["734.72","he came to Nao theama and he stripped "],["737","off his clothes and he too prophesied "],["739.279","before Samuel and laid down naked all "],["742.16","that day and all that night therefore it "],["744.88","said is Saul also among the prophets so "],["749.32","we see here that David has "],["751.8","fled from Saul and he runs where who "],["755.279","does he go to "],["756.639","now goes to Samuel Samuel is no longer "],["760.48","the leader of the nation Saul he doesn't "],["762.68","have control of the armies anymore "],["764","Saul's got control of the armies but "],["765.8","Samuel is still the spiritual leader "],["768.8","he's still the prophet of the Lord he's "],["771.36","still the servant of the Lord and what "],["773.48","you're going to see here is that the "],["775.36","servant of the Lord is more powerful "],["777.399","than the king of the nation the servant "],["779.72","of the Lord is more powerful than the "],["781.839","king of the nation but the first thing "],["783.839","this illustrates to us is "],["786.8","that we can do is it

"],["1021.12","hands we'll we'll call for a special "],["1024","specific intercessory prayer at that "],["1026.28","time and then we'll do a a specific "],["1029.12","prayer for that individual and

"],["1069.28","and will hear our prayers God will hear "],["1071.919","our cries the individual themselves is "],["1074.24","usually stuttering and shaking and "],["1076.08","crying and then you all

the great love of God compels "],["1092.72","him to heal and help and to save us and "],["1098","that's when we experience "],["1099.64","Miracles and that's why we see Miracles "],["1102.4","at Faith

you have to believe and you have "],["1124.76","to obey and you have to what does it "],["1126.88","tell us tell us to do you have to "],["1130.36","confess I'm here to listen and to "],["1132.559","counsel and to pray for you but what I "],["1134.84","can't do is I can't chase you to your "],["1136.36","home and I can't force you you I can't "],["1138.919","tell you what you need

"],["1178.559","going to change it around we'll figure "],["1179.84","it out but we're going to keep offering "],["1181.559","intercessory prayers because it's too "],["1183.4","important it's the time when the god the "],["1186","Holy Spirit can show up and he can meet "],["1189.2","with us and he can help us and that's "],["1192.36","exactly what happens for David Samuel "],["1194.72","doesn't have an army to give David "],["1196.679","Samuel can't remove Saul his King Samuel "],["1199.24","in and of himself can do very little "],["1201.12","physically for him Samuel's just an old "],["1203.039","guy but what he does Samuel does is he "],["1206.2","hears from God the Holy Spirit and he is "],["1209.24","the prophet of the Lord and he can "],["1212.84","prophets what prophets prophesy right so "],["1216.24","he can just start prophesying and when "],["1218.84","the messengers of Saul come and these "],["1220.48","Messengers they would have been armed "],["1222.2","and they're here to to uh arrest David "],["1224.84","when they show up and Saul Samuel just "],["1227.2","stands up the other prophets and they "],["1229.36","start

"],["1237.52","some more see he send some more and they "],["1239.08","come in there up against the spirit of "],["1240.72","the Lord and the prophet the man of God "],["1242.48","and they start prophesying the spirit of "],["1244","God hits those guys and they start "],["1245.559","prophesying too and he sends another "],["1247.2","group and another group comes in and the "],["1249.2","same

"],["1257.76","heads on up there he can't even get to "],["1260.32","the place the Bible tells us that he's "],["1262.44","walking along the road and he starts "],["1265.24","prophesying the spirit of

because everyone "],["221.099","else had a lot of family and a lot of "],["223.379","cousins and also when I was young I "],["225.42","never really had what you consider a "],["228.18","best friend there was lots of kids that "],["230.519","I was friendly with and we'd go out in "],["232.26","the yard we play games together we play "],["235.2","sports together but nobody I was really "],["237.239","that tight close friend with and as you "],["240.06","know when you play sports from time to "],["242.519","time there's fights or there's scuffles "],["244.5","and generally speaking I was on my own "],["246.72","in those situations "],["248.76","kind of had to stand up for myself plus "],["251.04","I've noticed I kind of have an out there "],["253.439","personality and back when I was in "],["255.599","Middle School I could rub the older "],["257.639","fellas the wrong way and uh you know I'd "],["261.66","have to stand up for myself sometimes "],["263.22","and push back and "],["265.32","and you know nobody would take up for me "],["267.84","and sometimes I felt ostracized and and "],["270.6","kind of left out and sometimes I had "],["272.34","some lonely walks home "],["273.9","uh but that all changed in high school "],["276.72","for me uh one of the things about being "],["280.62","a pastor's kid is you're always the "],["283.02","first person to church Lori and you're "],["284.94","always the last one to leave aren't you "],["286.979","that's what happens when you're a "],["288.12","pastor's kid you're there early and you "],["289.62","have to stay till the very end and when "],["291.6","I got into high school I used to take my "],["293.16","Dad's keys and I'd go sit in the car and "],["294.96","I'd listen to the radio to pass the time "],["297","and uh there was another person who was "],["299.4","always in the same boat as me his dad "],["301.62","was a deacon in the church and also the "],["303.479","song leader and he was always like my "],["305.46","dad there at the beginning and I left "],["307.139","all the way to the very end uh so he his "],["310.02","son was named was Kevin and uh Kevin "],["312.479","would come and join me in the car and "],["314.04","we'd sit there together and uh we would "],["316.62","uh listen to the radio together and we'd "],["319.02","sing songs together you know and just "],["321.18","kind of tell a bunch of crazy stories "],["323.039","and laugh at each other's foolishness "],["324.479","and it was a kind of a fun way to kill "],["326.52","30 minutes a time now prior to this "],["328.62","Kevin and I really didn't hang out all "],["330.66","that much he was a year older than me "],["332.34","and he already had a really good friend "],["333.9","in his grade name Mike "],["335.82","but as we hung on the car every Sunday "],["337.68","we discovered that we did have a lot in "],["339.3","common and we had the same sense of "],["340.919","humor and we so we just sit out there "],["342.9","and just kind of entertain ourselves uh "],["345.18","for that amount of time now at school we "],["348.18","there was always a group of us that was "],["349.62","from the same church and the same youth "],["351.12","group and we'd all sit together uh every "],["353.34","day for lunch and one of these days I "],["355.199","was just kind of being my normal Rob "],["356.759","self you know kind of loud and whatever "],["358.5","and I really ticked Mike off for some "],["360.84","reason and he got real ignorant with me "],["362.699","and before I had a chance to say "],["364.38","anything Kevin come across the table and "],["367.38","just wow I got all angry at him and "],["369.479","ripped into him and I remember you "],["371.34","remember Kevin and Mike were very good "],["373.259","friends and they were in the same class "],["374.46","and Mike was kind of shocked he just sat "],["376.44","there stunned for a minute "],["378.12","then he just got up and walked away "],["380.58","I never forgot that because For the "],["383.039","First Time I wasn't standing by myself "],["386.699","I had somebody who actually went to bat "],["388.5","for me and right then and there I knew "],["390.66","something had changed in the dynamic of "],["392.58","our peer group The loyalties had shifted "],["394.979","and I went from being a loner who was "],["396.84","ostracized to now having a loyal friends "],["400.62","and you know that kind of changed my "],["402.24","entire high school life after that "],["404.28","moment on to have a loyal friend "],["407.759","and even though Kevin they was related "],["410.16","to everybody in the church and he had "],["411.539","all kinds of cousins we kind of really "],["413.52","became as close as

"],["423.06","kind of assume your family is going to "],["425.039","do that but to have a friend who will "],["427.86","get your back that's a that's a valuable "],["430.8","thing Proverbs 18 22 24

"],["453.72","we'd be in youth group together but "],["455.46","sometimes those were the same people "],["457.08","that I would be fighting with and we'd "],["459.539","be have an attitude there in

verse 15 when Saul saw that he "],["37.12","meaning David was prospering greatly he "],["39.8","dreaded him but all of Israel and Judah "],["43.2","loved David and went out and came in "],["46.12","before "],["47.32","him then Saul said to David here's my "],["51.039","older daughter morab I will give her to "],["53.68","you as a "],["55.239","wife only be a valiant man for me and "],["58.559","fight the Lord's battles for Saul "],["60.399","thought my hand shall not be against him "],["63.719","but let the hand of my of the "],["65.199","Philistines be against him David said to "],["68.56","sa who am I and what is my life or my "],["72.68","father's family in Israel that I should "],["75.08","be the king's son-in-law so it came "],["77.68","about at that time when morab Saul's "],["79.36","daughter should have been given to David "],["81.119","he was given to Adriel the methon night "],["85.439","or her "],["86.799","wife now Mel Saul's daughter Lov "],["91.119","David when they told Saul the thing was "],["93.84","agreeable to him Saul thought I will "],["96.04","give her to him that she may be a snare "],["99.36","to him and that the hand of the "],["101.04","Philistines may be against him therefore "],["103.52","Saul said to David for a second time you "],["106.479","may be my son-in-law today speak to and "],["109.759","Saul commanded

"],["119.64","son "],["120.439","son-in-law so Saul servants spoke those "],["123.6","words to David but David said is it "],["126.159","trivial in your sight to become the "],["128.479","king's

David to become the king's "],["161.28","son-in-law before the day had expired "],["163.879","David Rose up and went and his men and "],["166.72","struck down 200 men from the Philistines "],["170.319","then David brought their foreskins and "],["172.879","they came gave them in full number to "],["175.319","the king that he might become the king's "],["178.48","son-in-law "],["180.239","so Saul gave him Mel his daughter for a "],["183.959","wife then Saul when Saul saw and knew "],["188.48","that the Lord was with David and that "],["190.2","Mel his Saul's daughter loved him then "],["192.76","Saul was even more afraid of David thus "],["195.56","Saul was David's enemy continually then "],["198.84","the commanders of the Philistines went "],["200.44","out to

"],["249.599","that Saul's trying to hook David up with "],["252.519","his daughter and you know maybe that "],["255.28","would be a good application for our "],["257.88","intern as well as a number

it's interesting in John chap "],["1110.44","11 this chapter where this conversation "],["1113.76","comes out of is the chapter where Jesus "],["1117.32","raises Lazarus from the dead the same "],["1121.08","chapter where Jesus brings somebody from "],["1123.52","the dead this conversation takes place "],["1125.84","now what's interesting is that the "],["1127.039","Pharisees were always saying to Jesus "],["1129.36","give us a sign show us a sign he's okay "],["1132.84","I'll show you a sign here Lazarus come "],["1134.44","forth okay I raised somebody from the "],["1136.36","dead what more do you want this is what "],["1138.44","they said after that the chief priests "],["1140.36","and the Pharisees called the meeting of "],["1141.799","the Sanhedrin and said man we got to "],["1143.559","follow Jesus because he raised people "],["1144.84","from the dead no they said what will we "],["1147.2","accom what are we accomplishing here is "],["1149.88","a man who's performing

him everyone's going to believe "],["1159.88","well yeah he's the Messiah they're "],["1161.559","supposed to and then what will happen "],["1163.6","Rome will come in and take our Temple "],["1165.24","and take our "],["1166.559","nation so he was all about their power "],["1169.36","all about their positions one of them "],["1171.559","Caiaphas who was the high priest of that "],["1173.24","year spoke up you know nothing you do "],["1175.72","not realize that it is better for one "],["1178.6","man to die than for the people than the "],["1182.12","whole nation and he said this not of his "],["1185.36","own but he was prophesying now what's "],["1187.4","interesting is he meant let's kill him "],["1189.039","to save the nation he didn't realize "],["1191.039","Jesus is there I'm going to die to save "],["1194.6","the nation and the world so so Saul's "],["1198.72","envy and fear allows a murdering Spirit "],["1200.76","to take over him question if Saul was

we're not going "],["1312.76","to come out of this one alive but how "],["1315.2","did this day finish for Israel knowing "],["1318.2","did they survive they were made stronger "],["1321.72","weren't they and often that's the case "],["1323.84","when it comes to tough tough battles "],["1325.48","that we have to face the conflicts the "],["1327.76","huge obstacles in our lives don't be "],["1330.44","scared of them not only can we win but "],["1333.84","we can come out gaining we can come out "],["1337.039","being made stronger as the result of the "],["1340.159","victories that God's going to get of us "],["1342.48","Isn't that cool all right well let's "],["1344.4","wrap this up a couple more details at "],["1346.6","the end of this chapter kind of the "],["1348.12","epilog actually gives us some "],["1349.76","foreshadowing here of things to come it "],["1352.24","says here a bo uh once he cut his head "],["1354.36","off down the road uh he's going to what "],["1357.36","David took the Philistines head brought "],["1359.64","it "],["1360.4","to Jerusalem and then he put He put the "],["1363.64","Philistines weapons in his own tent now "],["1366.2","Ju Just so you know that at this point "],["1368.48","in history Jerusalem is not the capital "],["1371.12","of Israel it's not in Israel's hands "],["1373.559","it's under another nation's control so "],["1376.039","why is he bringing the head of Goliath "],["1378.88","to "],["1383.039","Jerusalem what's that called that's some "],["1386.12","psychological warfare right there isn't "],["1388.08","it right he's showing up there hey "],["1393.76","guys right he's sending a "],["1397.039","message Jerusalem is where we find out "],["1400.159","later on David rules from and he sets up "],["1403.679","his throne and he builds his kingdom and "],["1405.84","they also build the temple of God in "],["1408.84","Jerusalem and also the Bible teaches us "],["1411.44","that it's going to be where the Messiah "],["1413.96","Reigns out of the city of Jerusalem and "],["1416.4","I think probably God the Holy Spirit has "],["1418.32","let David know well we're going after "],["1420.24","this city too so David's over there and "],["1422.679","he's kind of marking his territory he's "],["1424.36","sending a message see what happened to "],["1425.72","this big guy you're next be ready for it "],["1430.4","but before that it said it says it goes "],["1433.32","back here now it kind of jumps back in "],["1435.2","time uh Saul kind of get to shoot over "],["1437.919","here in a little side note on Saul Saul "],["1440.4","watch David going out to meet the "],["1441.919","Philistines as he leaves the tent before "],["1443.559","he fights and he says to Abner commander "],["1445.64","of the army who is this crazy person who "],["1448.08","is this young man whose son ad says I "],["1451.24","don't "],["1452.32","know King says find out whose son this "],["1455.08","young man is soon as David returned from "],["1457.2","killing the Philistine Abner took him "],["1458.64","and brought him before Saul with David "],["1460.76","still holding the

"],["1473.919","now critics will look at that and "],["1477.279","they'll say "],["1478.52","oh here's a problem in the text because "],["1482.559","you remember back in chapter 16 when "],["1486.559","they were looking for someone to play "],["1487.96","the harp the advisers of Saul said oh we "],["1491.559","know this guy he's a son of Jesse who "],["1494.279","can play the harp and he's this "],["1495.559","wonderful guy and he's bright and he's "],["1497","strong and he's sharp and they said "],["1498.48","we'll bring him in right so Saul has "],["1500.76","already been

"],["145.959","fell killing a giant before we get all "],["147.64","empowered to believe that God is going "],["149.319","to do Supernatural miracles to overcome "],["151.959","all of our troubles let's dig into the "],["155.84","observations and look at the details "],["158.72","about David's life personally in order "],["161.159","to do that we're going to have to go "],["162.36","back a chapter I know we don't like to "],["163.8","go backwards but we got to swing back "],["165.519","into chapter 16 we're going to be all "],["167.12","over the place today to be honest with "],["168.36","you in the Bible but in chapter 16 verse "],["171.76","number uh seven we remember that Samuel "],["174.519","went out to anoint one of the this the "],["176.72","sons of Jesse and uh the first one "],["179.08","showed up and he was was the big oldest "],["181","guy big rugged lad and and uh Sam said "],["183.56","oh that's the guy right there and God "],["185.44","said uh no don't uh don't look at the "],["189.76","outward appearance that's not the one "],["191.72","I've chosen man looks on the outward "],["194.76","appearance but God looks on the looks on "],["197.68","the heart right and then uh he went down "],["199.959","through the whole list and there wasn't "],["201.36","any of them and then they finally said "],["203.28","well yeah there's one more and it's "],["204.599","David and they brought him in and uh "],["207.84","they sent for him in verse number 11 and "],["209.879","came in and he looked he looked like a "],["211.319","young fell but you know the Lord said "],["213.599","arise anoint him this is he Samuel took "],["217.599","verse 13 took the Horn of the oil and "],["219.239","anointed him in the midst of the "],["220.959","Brethren Spirit of the Lord came "],["224.2","mightily upon David from that day "],["227.4","forward remember that the spirit of the "],["230.439","Lord came on David so God knew the the "],["234.12","kind of character the kind of person "],["236.879","David was in his heart how did God know "],["239.04","that because God had created David "],["242.799","didn't he God raises people up for "],["246.72","specific times and instances to do his "],["250.079","plans and his purposes and the victories "],["253.2","and the successes of David were in "],["255.2","accordance with the plans and the will "],["257.6","of God it's not about God wanting David "],["260.6","to be famous or happy God wants you "],["263.639","happy so he's going to help you win the "],["265.639","basketball game no that's not what's "],["267.84","going on here "],["270.24","it's way bigger than David's personal "],["272.199","goals it's God's plans that are going to "],["275.68","be fulfilled now many people will get "],["277.72","angry or bitter at God when God doesn't "],["280.96","come through for "],["282.88","them maybe God's not coming through for "],["285.52","you because you're trying to do things "],["288.08","that are not in accordance with God's "],["290.36","plans you're asking for things that God "],["294.479","really doesn't care about Lord if you "],["296.479","help me win the lottery I

verse 13 tells us "],["350.56","which is so important he was "],["352.28","what David was "],["354.8","what read it filled with the spirit "],["359","filled with with the spirit Zechariah 46 "],["362","not by might nor by power but by my "],["367.12","spirit says the Lord you're not just "],["370.96","Spirit-filled because you say you are "],["374.28","because you have some extra Sensational "],["377.28","experience that takes place at a special "],["379.68","meeting and now you've achieved more of "],["382.08","God that's making you more "],["385.12","Godly Paul clearly teaches us what "],["388.08","Spirit-filled looks like in Ephesians "],["391.28","turn to Ephesians this morning chapter "],["394.4","5 now as is usually the case with Paul "],["398.12","he doesn't just give you a short "],["400.599","three-word answer or a little bit he "],["404.639","usually gives you a lot of details a "],["407.44","whole chapter long worth of explaining "],["410.12","what Spirit fill looks like and what it "],["411.68","doesn't look like Paul exhorts Us in "],["414.4","Ephesians chapter 5 verse number one be "],["416.599","imitators of God as beloved children "],["419.479","walk in love just as Christ loved you "],["422.039","and gave himself for you an offering he "],["424.479","says be imitators of God Walk In Love "],["428.96","and then he goes on for "],["432.16","about third chap verse 3 to 12 and "],["435.479","explains what being an imitator of God "],["438.199","doesn't look like all the things that "],["440.28","you're not supposed to do if you're "],["441.96","going to be a child of God immoral and "],["444.319","impure and coarse jesting and and "],["446.879","deceiving yourself with empty words and "],["448.879","awe and on and on all the things that "],["450.68","you don't do as an imitator of God then "],["453.36","he gets to verse number 15 and he says "],["455.36","therefore be careful how you walk be not "],["458.44","as unwise men but be wise making the "],["461.08","most of your time do not be foolish "],["464.599","understanding the will of God don't be "],["466.12","drunk with wine be filled with the "],["468.199","spirit and then he says here's what the "],["469.84","being filled with the spirit filled with "],["471.36","the spirit it continues on the same in "],["472.96","same sentence be filled with the spirit "],["474.919","speaking to one another in Psalms and "],["476.52","hymns and spiritual songs making melody "],["478.639","in your hearts to to God verse 20 giving "],["480.72","thanks always for all things in the name "],["482.479","of the Lord Jesus Christ even to God the "],["485.08","father and then verse 21 be "],["488.039","subject to one another in the fear of "],["490.96","the "],["491.599","Lord so being spirit filled isn't having "],["494.28","a Halo and special powers being spirit "],["498.84","filled means you act and react like God "],["501.319","you speak Psalms hymns spiritual songs "],["503.879","making melody in your heart "],["506.599","giving what thanks for "],["509.84","for all things and then what verse 13 "],["515.599","be subjects which means what to submit "],["520.36","to serve to serve one "],["524.959","another serving and submitting doesn't "],["527.48","that describe "],["529.16","David David was uh the young fell he was "],["532.32","what he was serving his father taking "],["534.32","care of sheep and then we learn the next "],["536.12","time we saw David after he was anointed "],["538.24","he got asked to ser serve who Saul right "],["541.24","remember he was he was commissioned to "],["542.92","go and play the heart for Saul and drive "],["544.6","out the evil spirits he was full of the "],["546.279","spirit Spirit of the Lord and uh Saul "],["548.48","had an evil spirit and as David played "],["550.279","his har and and played praise and "],["551.76","worship music he would drive that evil "],["553.8","spirit away from him so you know serving "],["557.76","uh serving the uh Lord is is a great "],["561.2","thing serving your dad you know that's "],["563.24","kind of what you know you're supposed to "],["564.56","do serving the king would be an honor "],["567.2","but then in you look at chapter 7 "],["570.04","also there was somebody else he had to "],["571.48","serve too and so uh David the youngest "],["574.68","verse number 14 of chapter 17 1 "],["578.2","Samuel three oldest ones followed Saul "],["580.76","and David went back and forth from Saul "],["582.44","to attend his father's flock in "],["583.8","Bethlehem so he's at with "],["586.24","Saul in the in the in the king's court "],["588.72","serving him with the music and then he "],["590.04","goes what's he doing a spare time goes "],["592.68","back to his dads and he's serving taking "],["594.76","care of the sheep sometimes people tell "],["596.48","the story sort of like David just kind "],["597.88","of out of nowhere pops up on the field "],["599.8","and nobody know who who this kid is and "],["601.519","he kills this giant and wow uh then "],["603.88","Saul's excited about him no he already "],["605.44","knew who he was he was already well "],["607.32","known in the king's court before that "],["609.72","but he's going back and forth between "],["611.279","dad and his and the and the king and uh "],["614.16","it says that Jesse the David's uh father "],["617.839","sent him uh he said take your brothers "],["620.24","an epha of roasted grain verse 17 10 "],["623.16","Loaves and run to the camp to your "],["625.44","brothers and bring 10 cuts of cheese to "],["627.2","the commander of the thousands and look "],["629.24","onto the welfare of your brothers and "],["630.92","bring back news of "],["632.56","them so uh he's serving the king he's "],["635.279","serving his dad who else is he serving "],["637.92","oh Big Brothers right I mean serving the "],["641.519","dad you're supposed to and serving the "],["642.76","king that'd be cool but ask Tony serving "],["645.16","your big brother that's not always an "],["647.8","easy thing to do but that's David he "],["651","serves these are the characteristics "],["653.16","that define and describe somebody who is "],["655.44","Spirit-filled and I put a few more up "],["657.519","there because you already know these "],["658.88","that that uh to honor the Lord and serve "],["660.639","the Lord you need to do justly love "],["662.24","mercy and walk humbly before the Lord "],["663.92","your God what's the next list there "],["665.76","where do we find that Galatians chapter "],["668.079","5 that's the the fruit of the spirit "],["670.76","right love joy peace patience kindness "],["672.839","goodness faithfulness gentleness "],["674.399","self-control is the fruit of the spirit "],["677","the evidence that the spirit of God is "],["678.6","within you and then what we learned here "],["680.68","in Ephesians chapter 5 speaking the "],["683","hymns and the praise giving thanks for "],["684.92","all things and now most importantly we "],["687.519","see here to serve you're just supposed "],["690.079","to be "],["691.44","serving that's the evidence of the "],["693.839","spirit in you the spirit doesn't fill "],["696.68","you so that you can show off so that you "],["699.839","can be admired so that you can be "],["703.279","praised so that you can "],["705.6","rule the spirit fills you so that you "],["708.839","can serve submit to one another isn't "],["713","that the opposite of how a natural man "],["715.12","thinks right we would say if I had the "],["717.839","power I would "],["719.92","rule with it right I would tell people "],["722.2","what to do and make everything go my way "],["724","if I had power I'd rule God gives us the "],["726.76","power of the Holy Spirit not to rule but "],["728.8","to "],["730.44","serve you know what's something I i' "],["732.639","I've "],["733.959","observed weak people don't "],["737.839","serve they don't give weak people "],["742.12","take powerful people strong people deep "],["746.48","people "],["747.88","serve weak people wait around for "],["750.36","someone else to do the job they wait "],["752.36","around for someone to come along and do "],["754.8","their job or help them someone to

"],["775.76","right weak people complain about what "],["778.24","strong people are doing they're not "],["780.399","doing enough for them but strong people "],["782.72","serve weak people and that was David "],["785.6","full of the spirit and serving he was "],["788","chosen by God he was full of the spirit "],["790.48","David had some strength and some "],["792.88","skills now the story often gets told and "],["796.639","and we say David's the shepherd boy "],["798.36","right he's this little Shepherd boy you "],["800.519","know he's just out there strumming on "],["802.32","his little

"],["824","chapter 16 and we see that he's going "],["825.88","off to serve in King's Court Saul's "],["828.36","court and he's going off to fight "],["829.959","Goliath when did that happen he got "],["832.12","anointed and then well it's the next "],["834.56","verse so it's the next day right cuz "],["837.68","that's how we read scripture right right "],["838.88","it happens here he got

has rallied the armies of "],["80.4","Israel to defend the nation now both "],["82.159","armies ideally have some high ground "],["85.32","which is advantageous to both sides you "],["88.2","notice that neither one is advancing it "],["90","says one was on this mountain over here "],["91.64","and the other was on this mountain over "],["93.32","there and they're both really dug into "],["94.92","defense mode technically the Philistines "],["97.079","do not need to bother attacking because "],["98.96","they've already conquered peace of "],["101","Israel's land they're sitting

"],["219.08","explain this to you a little bit because "],["221.319","they're using some Old Testament "],["223.28","measurements units of measurement that "],["225.239","we don't know well first of all a Cuban "],["226.72","is 17.5 in we know this actually 17 and "],["231.08","a half inches we know this because the "],["233.36","silom tunnel in Jerusalem according to "],["236.68","the inscription carved in The Rock when "],["238.64","the people who built it carved in the "],["240.079","Rock and said this tunnel is 1,200 "],["243.319","cubits long so you measure the tunnel "],["246.12","there now and you do a bunch of math "],["249.04","which I don't like but you come to the "],["250.799","conclusion that uh well by the way it's "],["253.84","it's 582 yards the tunnel is 582 yards "],["258.759","896 and when you do the math one cubit "],["261.759","equals 17 and a half "],["265.52","in by just using that calculation the "],["269.44","span was a half a cubit so we realized "],["273.6","that Goliath was 6 and a half cubits "],["278.16","tall 6 and2 * 172 equals "],["284.199","9et 6 inches which is what that F right "],["288.08","there "],["289.4","is and Roberto

"],["303.039","by 10 but we tried our very "],["306.16","best that's the measurement though "],["308.4","that's how high I mean I've seen people "],["309.919","hold a stick up and say well you know "],["311.72","that's nine and a half feet it's like oh "],["313.44","wow you know that's really tall a stick "],["315.52","but when you kind of lay them out "],["317.28","proportioned you know it gives you some "],["319.44","sense a little more even though he's "],["321.039","two-dimensional still that's a big dude "],["324.84","isn't "],["325.8","it now some Scholars "],["330.039","have a

him at four five four "],["343.12","and a half cubits and uh that would "],["345.88","equal him 66 and they reason well that "],["349.759","yeah that's much better and they say "],["351.759","well you know because the average the "],["354.12","average person in Israel back in that "],["356.4","day was around 5 six so if this guy's "],["359.319","six six that's going to be really big to

there is a "],["793.04","deceitful dark side to every one of us "],["797.279","each and every one of us has a sin "],["799.04","nature from the sweet little old "],["800.48","grandmas "],["801.6","to

to him and we learn to "],["825.839","live like him now that isn't to say that "],["829.6","people who don't trust in jesus cannot "],["831.36","do anything good no their people can act "],["833.92","good they can show a good side but the "],["836.48","sin side is always still there "],["839.6","and eventually you're gonna see that "],["841.839","side of someone everyone in here "],["844.399","you you get to know them close enough "],["845.92","eventually you're gonna see "],["847.6","that dark side side "],["850.16","some people are just better at hiding "],["851.44","that

"],["859.68","don't really show it too much they they "],["861.92","they act pretty good meanwhile others of "],["864.48","us we're just kind of all out there "],["866.399","right you know we're we're not discreet "],["868.639","we're not reserved we're very blatantly "],["871.36","obvious that there's a problem and "],["873.279","people say man that kid has got issues "],["876.399","some problems

"],["149.52","the livestock "],["151.36","to use for sacrifices because god "],["153.84","commands that we sacrifice so he must "],["157.28","like sacrifices right god that makes god "],["160.08","happy "],["161.28","that's not it "],["162.959","sacrifices are done not to make god "],["165.36","happy but they're done to atone "],["167.68","for sin god's not happy about things "],["170.56","being killed but something has to die "],["173.84","because of sin and disobedience instead "],["176.319","of the person having to die to pay for "],["178.08","their sins the "],["179.92","old testament the animal would "],["182","symbolically take the individual's place "],["184.879","we no longer have to do animal "],["186.56","sacrifices because the once for all

he will "],["211.44","use as a sacrifice in an attempt to make "],["213.44","god happy "],["215.28","so samuel does one of these "],["218.319","right "],["219.28","no "],["220","saul "],["221.28","sacrifices don't make god happy what "],["223.519","makes god happy "],["225.12","obedience "],["226.4","verse 22-23 "],["228.72","has the lord as much delight in burnt

can go "],["274.72","do my own thing right we'll do some "],["276.24","prayers we'll attend some services i'll "],["278.16","give some money i've done something that "],["280.4","makes god happy now i got that out of "],["282.4","the way uh where were we yes back to the "],["284.8","things that make me happy and i'll get "],["286.72","back to pleasing myself and then we do "],["290.4","things that he's commanded us not to do "],["293.52","samuel says to saul you disobeyed and "],["296.479","saul says what "],["298","no i've obeyed and he starts rattling "],["300.72","off all the things that he

all the things "],["310.479","that i'm doing for you i'm almost always "],["313.039","obedient there's a few things i do wrong "],["315.759","but look at all the stuff that i'm doing "],["317.6","right "],["319.199","but when we deliberately do things we "],["321.28","know god has commanded us not to do god "],["323.84","doesn't call that almost obedience "],["327.36","he doesn't say well good enough "],["330.32","he calls deliberate disobedience "],["333.84","rebellion "],["335.52","and "],["336.32","stubbornness "],["338.88","can i put a disclaimer on this message "],["340.4","is that all right "],["341.919","this is not "],["343.36","what i want to preach to my friends "],["346.8","this morning "],["348","i'm not in any way unhappy or personally "],["350.4","offended or dissatisfied with anybody "],["352.639","here in our church "],["354.56","i have nobody in mind directly that i "],["356.56","want to target this morning "],["360.08","but "],["361.44","here's what i have to do "],["363.759","i'm obligated to teach first samuel "],["366","chapter 15. i'm obligated by the calling "],["369.039","god has in my life and the authority of "],["370.8","his word to declare to you the whole "],["373.039","council of god i can't skip over this "],["376.4","and a big reason why i would like to "],["378.16","skip over this is because i see "],["380.639","inadequate inadequacies in my own life "],["384","i know i am as guilty of this one "],["387.44","as anyone here today "],["389.36","so i'm as uncomfortable with this as you "],["392.479","will be which indicates to me "],["395.44","it's probably exactly what we need to "],["396.88","hear "],["398","so "],["399.039","let's talk about rebellion "],["401.68","rebellion is the sin of witchcraft "],["405.039","the lord says or samuel says to the lord "],["407.12","deuteronomy 18 9-13 "],["410","when you come into the land which the "],["411.68","lord god has given to you this is a "],["413.759","commandment the law of god given by "],["416","moses to the children of israel you "],["418.08","shall "],["418.96","not learn "],["420.319","to follow the abominations of

practices witchcraft craft or "],["432.24","soothsayer or one who interprets omens "],["434.479","or a sorcerer or one who conjures spells "],["436.72","or a medium or a spiritus or one who "],["438.88","calls up the dead for all who do these "],["441.599","things are an abomination to the lord "],["444.4","and because of these abominations the "],["446.639","lord your god drives them out before you "],["449.28","you shall "],["450.4","be blameless "],["452","before the lord your god "],["455.039","what is rebellion "],["456.8","well the hebrew word is "],["458.88","it means contentious "],["460.56","dispute "],["461.919","stubbornness so rebellion and "],["463.44","stubbornness are coinciding and samuel's "],["465.84","using them interchangeably in these two "],["468.4","verses here now according to the "],["470.08","theological word book of the old "],["471.68","testament by harrison archer and walkie "],["474.479","rebellion may be illustrated in two

rebellion can be illustrated indeed "],["490.16","doing things that violate the commands "],["492.96","of god very interesting because some "],["495.199","people "],["496.24","will argue with god's

don't do anything their words and "],["510.319","their conversations "],["512.479","are rebellious "],["513.919","some of us that's our nature to question "],["516.159","and complain "],["517.36","to

"],["590.64","we can't handle this we're all going to "],["592.399","die and joshua mccabe said no no we "],["594.64","could do it just trust the lord we'll be "],["596.16","good and then they decided

"],["707.92","tells him what the lord has said he "],["709.12","doesn't argue or "],["711.36","but he just when it's time to do it what "],["713.12","does he do "],["714.079","he just does whatever he

in when i was in "],["437.36","junior high "],["439.28","so i went through this transition of "],["440.96","being a very happy kid to not feeling "],["444.24","like i fit in "],["445.84","and i also had something else going "],["447.28","against me i i wasn't i wasn't a quiet "],["449.599","child i was very talkative and "],["452.56","expressive and impulsive and "],["455.68","and that means you

"],["491.919","people just don't seem to like me "],["495.039","just not very light that sounds like a "],["498","really sad story i know "],["500.16","and i did have some insecurity but "],["502.4","fortunately "],["503.52","junior high doesn't last very long and "],["506.4","there were some people that liked me and "],["507.84","i managed to develop some friends who

"],["45.6","uh let's read the passage and then we'll "],["47.68","jump in "],["48.8","uh to the uh where we left off "],["51.12","so let's pick it up in verse two thus "],["53.199","saith the lord of hosts "],["55.6","i will punish amalek "],["57.68","for all he did to israel "],["60.079","how he set himself against you on the "],["62.079","way while you were coming from egypt "],["64.4","now go and strike amalek and utterly "],["66.72","destroy all that he has do not spare him "],["70.08","but put to death man and woman child "],["72","infant ox sheep camel and donkey "],["76.08","then saw "],["77.36","respond some then saw some of the people "],["79.84","and numbered them at telange 200 000 "],["82.96","foot soldiers and 10 000 men of judah "],["86.88","saul came to the city of amalek and set "],["89.6","an ambush in the valley and saul said to "],["92.079","the canaanites go depart go down from "],["94.72","among the amalekites so i do not destroy "],["97.119","you with them for you show kindness to "],["99.36","the sons of israel when they came up "],["100.88","from egypt so the kenites very wisely "],["103.04","departed from among the amalekites saul "],["105.439","defeated the amalekites from "],["107.759","a villa as you go to sure which is east "],["110.96","of egypt he captured egg the king of the "],["113.68","amalekites "],["115.119","alive "],["116.24","utterly destroyed all the people with "],["118.24","the edge of the sword but saul and the "],["119.92","people spared egg egg and the best of "],["122.719","the sheep and the oxen and the fatting "],["124.719","and the lambs all "],["126.96","and all destroyed them utter and "],["129.599","and all that was good and were not "],["131.52","willing to destroy them utterly but "],["133.36","everything despised them worthless they "],["134.959","utterly destroyed "],["137.36","then the word of the lord came to samuel "],["139.12","saying "],["140.16","i regret that i have made saul king for "],["143.04","he has turned his back from following me "],["145.28","and has not carried out "],["147.12","my commands "],["150.16","our perspective of good is not always "],["151.92","the same as god's the reoccurring "],["153.519","mistake that saul keeps making is he "],["156.319","does good "],["157.68","but he doesn't completely obey "],["160.72","last week we learned about the good that "],["162.72","god that saul had accomplished we saw in "],["164.64","verse number four that saul is good at "],["166.959","summoning the army he's able to uh "],["169.44","influence people and he influences the "],["171.28","mighty men the valiant men to follow him "],["173.519","and we talked about leading his "],["175.04","influence we talked about the fact that "],["177.12","we too ought to be intentionally "],["179.04","influencing people and leading them to "],["181.68","faith in jesus christ "],["184.159","verse number five he said that saul came "],["186.8","and we said you got to show up right you "],["189.28","got to show up if you're going to lead "],["191.44","anyone to go anywheres you got to be "],["193.76","willing to move yourself and guess what "],["196.319","you all showed up again so thank you "],["197.84","glad you made it back to be here with us "],["199.84","this morning that's good verse number "],["201.92","six saul showed discernment in his "],["204.48","handling of the kenites even though we "],["207.12","often see saul doing the wrong thing he "],["210.159","was able to make good choices "],["212.4","people who you think are bad can do good "],["215.92","and people who you assume are good can "],["220.08","mess up right "],["221.599","so we learned that it's better to be "],["223.84","to thoughtfully listen and then "],["226.56","respectfully disagree than it is to "],["228.64","emotionally prejudge people just because "],["231.28","you assume that they're going to be "],["232.879","wrong all the time "],["235.76","verse number seven we saw that saul "],["238.4","defeated the amalekites so so far so "],["241.12","good uh everything has been great and "],["243.84","now comes the disobedient part verse "],["246.159","number eight it says that he captured "],["248.4","egg the king of the amalekites alive "],["250.879","utterly destroyed all the people at the "],["252.319","edge of the sword but saul and the "],["253.599","people spared egg egg and the best of "],["255.12","the sheep and the oxen the batting and "],["256.479","the lambs and all that was good he "],["257.919","didn't destroy them "],["260.16","that wasn't what he's supposed to do "],["261.919","then in verse number 10 the lord said i "],["263.84","regret that i've made saul king he's "],["266.08","turned his back from following me so we "],["268.56","have here two agendas that are "],["271.919","conflicting "],["273.44","god's agenda and saul's agenda based on "],["277.04","what we see and know "],["280.16","both have perspectives god has a "],["282.479","perspective saul has a perspective "],["285.68","and then "],["287.28","they're making judgment calls based on "],["288.8","their perspectives let's talk a little "],["290.8","bit about perspective "],["292.72","last friday i went to uh parents day at "],["295.199","king's christian academy "],["296.8","i came in right on time place was all "],["299.28","full of parents all "],["301.199","busy and "],["302.479","and i wanted to get a seat first thing i "],["304.24","was looking for was an empty spot "],["306.56","i want to sit someplace where i can "],["308.88","see the front where the kids are and i "],["310.88","also wanted to sit someplace where "],["312.08","eliana could see me because she wasn't "],["313.44","there yet so she had to come in the door "],["315.12","the gym and i didn't want to be at the "],["316.24","back so i decided i'm going to sit right "],["318","on the edge of the stage which gave me "],["319.759","the view of the front gave me the view "],["320.96","of the door to give me the view of all "],["322.639","the people sitting there which is "],["323.759","interesting because i just like looking "],["325.919","at people "],["326.96","you know what i like you understand what "],["328.32","i'm saying anybody like that just you "],["329.68","know go to the wall what mall and you "],["330.96","look at people right we uh eliana was uh "],["333.919","shopping yesterday and i was just "],["335.52","watching crazy people walk by "],["337.44","so "],["338.8","anyways um so i found my spot and i'm "],["341.28","make some small talk cause i know the "],["342.639","people that are sitting here "],["344.16","and that's all well and good and uh then "],["346.96","i uh now that i'm sitting there uh the "],["349.919","next thing i look for is uh all you "],["352.24","parents that were there what's the next "],["353.12","thing you look for you look for your "],["355.12","that's right you look for your kids "],["356.32","where are my kids okay so look around "],["358.4","okay there's tony sitting over there "],["359.919","cutting up with his class and here's "],["361.759","rick standing over here against the wall "],["362.96","of the ensemble okay so i know where "],["364.24","they're at i can see them and now after "],["366.72","i've done that now i start looking at "],["369.36","the crowd because now i want to see "],["372.4","where my friends are right i want to "],["374","kind of find where's my people where's "],["375.759","my faith bible church people where's all "],["377.12","the people i know and i get to try to "],["379.199","check out where everyone's at so i'm "],["381.28","doing all of that "],["383.28","now uh "],["385.759","because i'm sitting on the stage i can "],["387.039","see a certain amount of people but then "],["388.56","rick was going to do this as this "],["390.24","message so i a little a little speech he "],["393.199","had to do so i thought okay instead of "],["394.639","sitting down i'm going to stand up so i "],["396.639","can film it so once i stood up i then "],["399.12","could see "],["400.319","like everyone now i could see oh okay "],["402.56","there's "],["403.36","i see where jim and julie are sitting "],["404.479","all the way over there on the other side "],["405.6","so i started finding all of my people so "],["407.84","much more and it gave me a better view "],["409.84","to uh film the whole little speech he "],["412.08","was doing but even with that perspective "],["414.319","of being up higher and seeing so much "],["416","more i still didn't catch everybody "],["418.319","because uh eric was was there and he "],["420.16","texted me he said oh rick did a good job "],["421.68","and i was like you were there i didn't "],["422.8","even see you you normally if eric's "],["424.96","there i send him taxes and make fun of "],["426.56","the kids and things like that we "],["427.68","entertain ourselves uh you know through "],["430.08","all those exciting children's things but "],["432.88","oh sorry i wasn't supposed to share that "],["435.12","what i'm trying to illustrate is that "],["436.88","from where we sit in life we have a "],["438.72","perspective "],["440.16","and we formulate our opinions based on "],["442.24","what we see "],["443.919","and what we know "],["445.68","but then you get to move sometimes or "],["448.24","you get moved and then you see something "],["450.24","from a different angle and you learn and "],["452.639","then what happens you change your "],["455.28","perspective on things have you ever "],["456.88","experienced this you ever had a strong "],["458.639","opinion of some of you have done that "],["459.759","right you've had a real strong opinion "],["461.36","and you made a judgment call but then "],["462.72","you receive new information and that "],["464.72","changes your perspective so saul sits on "],["467.919","the throne as the head of the nation and "],["470","he gets all this information and he sees "],["472.24","the other nations around him and he sees "],["474.56","a lot "],["476","but god "],["477.599","sits where "],["479.52","above everything "],["481.039","and sees everything knows everything and "],["483.28","he's got the best perspective "],["486.319","from his "],["487.52","vantage point from god's perspective he "],["490.08","sees that these amalekites need to be "],["492.56","severely judged god is doing this for "],["495.28","justice he's decreed that there's "],["497.44","nothing good with the amalekites it's "],["499.84","all been corrupted all have sinned and "],["502.639","everything is under the wrath we have a "],["506.24","hard time getting our heads around "],["508.24","everything being under the wrath that's "],["510.24","a very strong that's a very hard concept "],["513.36","for us we want mercy and grace and "],["517.12","that's understandable because we live in "],["519.36","the age of grace and uh we appreciate it "],["523.44","amen we're grateful for it it's a high "],["525.76","value and a priority for us to reach "],["527.76","people with the grace of god and the "],["530.48","mercy that has been extended to us it's "],["532.48","so good because we need it every day "],["536","god's mercies are new every morning is "],["538.64","anybody so thankful that god's mercy was "],["541.2","new today to you yes because i was not "],["543.2","always you know yesterday i may not have "],["544.8","been perfect right maybe you weren't "],["546.399","your best maybe you had a fight last "],["548.399","night or in the car this morning that "],["549.839","happens occasionally with people you "],["551.2","know but god's mercy is new every "],["554.48","morning "],["555.519","and that mercy is extended to us it's so "],["557.68","good uh "],["559.68","we're thankful for it "],["561.76","the these people "],["564.32","were not under "],["566","that amazing grace "],["567.76","they were in the age of what "],["571.04","the age of that's right doug the age of "],["573.04","law "],["574.24","sin the age of law where where sin "],["576.48","requires the death penalty an eye for a "],["579.68","eye a tooth for a tooth balance and "],["582.64","payback there was a dead o to god for "],["585.68","the sins committed by these people so "],["587.839","there's justice now we may not like that "],["590.56","but that's the way it is but understand "],["592.64","this folks "],["594","in order for us to appreciate the "],["595.76","amazing grace we all love that song "],["598.08","amazing grace how sweet the sound in "],["599.839","order to appreciate the grace and the "],["601.12","mercy that god's given to us first of "],["603.279","all you need to understand the wrath "],["605.839","that is due us "],["607.6","in order to really capture the grace you "],["609.76","have to understand the punishment that "],["612.16","awaits we're not spared "],["615.12","because we're nice "],["616.8","and we've earned the grace of god we're "],["619.12","spared because of god's great love for "],["622.24","us that god gave himself up his only "],["625.76","begotten son stood in our place and "],["628.56","suffered the wrath and the reason why we "],["631.04","don't suffer it is because jesus has "],["633.76","taken it all for us "],["636.079","who his own self bear "],["639.68","who sins "],["640.88","our sins in his body on the tree that we "],["644.88","being dead to sin should "],["647.2","live unto righteousness by his "],["650.16","stripes "],["651.36","we are healed we don't face wrath "],["653.68","because jesus did it for us but that "],["655.839","doesn't mean that there is no longer any "],["657.68","wrath we need to never forget that just "],["660","because we might personally built from "],["661.6","under it doesn't mean it's gone people "],["664.24","are under the wrath of god in the past "],["666.88","people today are under the wrath of god "],["669.44","and in the future if you read the last "],["671.44","book you know the wrath of god is going "],["673.6","to be poured out on the entire earth so "],["676.32","we can't always get our heads around "],["677.76","that and neither can saw he can't get "],["680.16","his head around understanding that "],["681.68","everything connected to the amalekites "],["683.76","is under the wrath now not because he "],["686","wants mercy for them he can't get his "],["688.48","head around the fact that all this "],["690.16","wealth has got to be destroyed "],["692.8","why can't we just keep some of this "],["694.48","right why can't we enjoy some of this "],["697.2","good do you remember what saul was doing "],["699.6","before he was anointed the king what was "],["702.399","he doing "],["703.92","he was that's right he was chasing the "],["705.68","donkeys around remember and uh he was "],["708.24","diligent going for days and days looking "],["710.079","for these donkeys why was he doing that "],["712.399","because he is a he really loves donkeys "],["714.72","you know is that what it was "],["716.8","is that what he was lauren he's thinking "],["718.16","oh poor donkeys are so lost "],["721.12","no "],["722.32","no he he he was chasing those donkeys "],["724.56","because he knew what they were "],["726.72","worth right he knew there was a value "],["729.6","connected to them "],["731.36","and that's because he grew up around "],["732.8","them that was his upbringing i've worked "],["734.959","on dairy farms and uh farmers aren't "],["737.36","necessarily animal lovers "],["740.079","some of you know right they really don't "],["741.6","they they don't do that because oh i "],["743.279","love cows no they do it because it's "],["745.6","it's all right it's money and they earn "],["747.04","a living off it if you ever need a part "],["749.44","for your car "],["750.88","you should check first of all with john "],["752.959","murdock he might have it because he's "],["754.959","got a whole garage full of car parts and "],["758.32","some of you remember when i first got "],["759.68","here that old montana i drove remember "],["761.12","the whole

that part and "],["802.079","he saved himself some money because he's "],["804.56","kept it and he knows the value of every "],["806.639","little knob or screw that he takes off "],["809.36","he knows how much that is worth saul "],["811.519","knows the value of every donkey "],["814.88","every ox every sheep "],["817.839","and also he knows the difference between "],["820.72","poor herds and "],["822.639","average herds and "],["824.8","prize-winning herds right he knows the "],["827.12","difference in what he's looking at so "],["829.76","in st mary's uh fall fair i always go to

"],["1362.48","pursued him and they caught him and they "],["1364.72","cut off his thumbs and his big toes and "],["1367.12","then adoni blezzak said 70 kings with "],["1369.919","their thumbs and

"],["1378.88","their thumbs and their toes and they let "],["1380.24","them hang out with him and they would "],["1381.919","capture scraps under his table what does "],["1383.52","that do for him

to the commands from the "],["140.52","Lord he sets out to do them but then he "],["143.58","puts his own spin his own twist he adds "],["147.84","his own little spice to the recipe he "],["150.959","almost does it right "],["152.76","then he messes up "],["154.44","kind of like our beloved computers right "],["157.62","this technology is a tremendous blessing "],["160.379","it

key off on the action verb "],["192.9","in these verses and make an observation "],["195.72","and application interpretation and an "],["198","application for you so we're in verse "],["200.04","number four and we see that Saul what's "],["202.319","the first action he does so "],["204.54","there you go you know what verbs are "],["206.28","look at you all grammar students saw "],["208.68","some of the people and he numbered them "],["210.239","200 000 footstoolers ten thousand of "],["213.36","this men of Judah "],["215.159","and that's the first thing he does he's

you become a "],["270.78","leader but it doesn't make you the "],["273","leader because leadership is "],["275.82","influence I had this uh interesting "],["279.6","interesting discussion with my oldest "],["281.22","son over break when he was home at "],["282.6","Christmas Roberto was what I call a "],["284.82","reluctant leader a reluctant leader he "],["287.28","doesn't like the planning and organizing "],["289.38","side of things he doesn't like to "],["291.3","stretch himself out of his comfort zone "],["292.979","he never will ever show you what he's "],["295.259","completely capable of and he'll never "],["297.6","admit it but he does know how to "],["300.72","influence and I've seen him do it with "],["302.58","his his friends his peers when he wants "],["305.16","to do something and he wants to pull "],["307.08","them together he sways everyone to do it "],["310.08","his way so I was talking to him over "],["311.88","Christmas break because you know he's in "],["313.139","college now and we can have intellectual "],["314.58","philosophical conversations not just "],["316.38","clean your room and do your homework we "],["317.699","can talk about other things and I was "],["319.56","talking to him about this uh principal "],["321.54","leadership and I said Roberto I noticed "],["322.919","that you you have the ability to do this "],["324.72","and he admitted and he said this is how "],["326.58","I operate dad he said when I when I "],["328.8","wanted to get my friends to do something "],["330.84","I will talk to each one individually and "],["333.9","I will I will get them a one-on-one to "],["335.759","agree with me and then that way when we "],["339.18","all get to the together as a group "],["340.68","everyone already knows what we're going "],["343.259","to do and then we all do it and if "],["345.78","there's one person who really doesn't "],["346.919","want to it doesn't matter because I got "],["348.419","the pull of the whole group which uh "],["350.52","which convinces them so I just smiled "],["352.979","and nodded my head when he told me his "],["354.9","little strategy because that is exactly "],["356.82","how you Influence People you build "],["359.539","one-on-one personal relationships and "],["362.88","because somebody cares about you and "],["364.919","they have this personal relationship "],["366.36","they appreciate you they will want to be "],["368.94","around you they will want to work with "],["370.74","you and they may even actually follow "],["372.84","you okay well that's great why is that "],["374.58","important for us today "],["375.78","dear friends we have a responsibility to "],["380.4","lead people "],["382.68","where "],["384.3","we have a responsibility to lead people "],["386.4","to Jesus the more people the better "],["388.919","correct how many people are we supposed "],["391.199","to lead to Jesus "],["394.74","as many as possible right as many as "],["398.28","possible starting many times with our "],["400.919","families our loved ones people who are "],["403.86","closest to us why do we usually start "],["405.18","with those relationships "],["407.58","because those people ought to care "],["409.919","enough about us to want to uh follow us "],["413.94","and we ought to care enough about them "],["415.44","to make an extra effort to try to lead "],["417.96","them under the path of eternal life but "],["420.12","also because we probably have enough "],["421.74","influence to you know at least get the "],["423.479","kids in the car and get them to church "],["425.1","and things like that we should be able "],["426.539","to at least pull that one off but that's "],["428.22","a good start but that's not where it "],["429.78","should end no we are supposed to care "],["431.34","about all lost souls God loves "],["435.539","for God so loved the The World God loves "],["439.08","everyone he cares about everyone "],["440.28","therefore we should care about everyone "],["442.86","that means we need to be actively and "],["445.44","intentionally trying to connect with "],["447.66","people trying to build relationships "],["449.759","trying to care for them and love them "],["452.34","and that way we can influence them and "],["454.74","we can lead them to Jesus where are you "],["457.259","actively doing this "],["459.84","this needs to be intentional when I was "],["463.08","growing up "],["464.699","all right our next door neighbor at New "],["466.62","Brunswick Bible Institute in friend of "],["468.479","our family was Al and Brenda Cabral I "],["471.9","was eight years old when we moved beside "],["473.58","Al and Brenda they had no kids of their "],["475.979","own so they didn't have any friends for "],["477.599","me to play with but even though they "],["479.34","were absolutely no relationship to us "],["481.139","before too long I started calling them "],["483.06","Uncle Al and Aunt Brenda you want to "],["486.84","know why because Uncle Al would hire me "],["489.72","to cut his grass and clean his car and "],["492.78","weed his garden and you might say that "],["495.06","sounds like a lot of slave labor but "],["496.68","those are things I wanted to do because "],["498.36","I was always trying to earn "],["500.4","some money right and he would uh he "],["502.8","would hire me and he would let me do a "],["504.84","sloppy job weeding his garden or cutting "],["506.879","his grass but he was helping me learn "],["509.099","and grow and then he'd give me extra "],["510.96","change and then he would give me his "],["513","refundable pop bottles does anybody "],["514.62","remember refundable pop bottles do you "],["516.3","know about that right you're worth a "],["518.099","nickel or a dime and you take them back "],["519.479","to the store and I take the refunds down "],["521.58","to the store Al would take me hunting "],["523.8","and he would he would always be very "],["525.66","kind with me and Al like my dad was a "],["528.54","Bible teacher at this at the Bible "],["530.1","college but he was also an evangelist "],["532.2","and whenever uh Uncle Al spoke I was "],["535.38","always on the edge of my seat "],["537.959","listening to every word he had to say he "],["540.66","wasn't like the other boring preachers "],["542.339","that I had to listen to anybody know I'm "],["544.019","talking about boring preachers I mean "],["545.459","not here I understand not here but other "],["547.62","places I'm sure you've heard "],["549.48","he told stories and he was funny and he "],["552.72","brought the word to life and always felt "],["555","like I was learning something really "],["556.8","important when he spoke "],["559.019","as a teenager altook our our youth group "],["561.72","from our church down to Atlanta for a "],["563.7","short-term missions trip and I really "],["565.14","wanted to be part of

that but because Al was "],["575.16","leading I wanted to be part of it apart "],["578.82","from my own father the second most "],["580.62","influential person in my Spiritual "],["582.839","Development was Al Cabral "],["585.3","in my style of communication is somewhat "],["587.88","an imitation of how he preached I guess "],["590.7","I would say that I'm a blend of my "],["592.86","father's expository teaching style and "],["595.32","Uncle Al's animated storytelling "],["597.48","preaching style but my point is this I "],["600.24","was much more interested in listening to "],["603.24","preacher Al "],["604.62","and following evangelist Al as a "],["608.04","teenager because at first of all to me "],["610.86","he was "],["612.42","Uncle out "],["614.04","I didn't grow up with a family uh in in "],["617.459","around me I didn't have relatives to "],["619.86","invest time in me I didn't have any "],["621.3","grandparents or aunts or uncles I never "],["623.279","had teachers that saw anything in me I "],["625.5","never had coaches that made a big deal "],["627","about me being on the team but there was "],["629.76","one God "],["631.32","who would spend some extra time with me "],["633.54","who gave me some extra change who made "],["636.12","me feel like I was important and because "],["638.04","I knew he cared about me I would follow "],["642","him "],["643.14","I tried to be like him and today I do "],["646.32","what my dad and what Al Cabral modeled "],["649.92","to me and showed me how to do you can "],["652.86","influence somebody "],["654.48","with love "],["655.92","with time "],["658.079","some care for that if Saul can summon "],["660.839","people "],["662.399","if he can influence surely there's "],["665.1","someone that you can influence as well "],["668.579","verse number five it says that the next "],["671.16","action verb we see here is what so "],["674.16","Saul came to the city of

a couple of them "],["1466.82","a few of them actually went in and it "],["1468.799","was a close game and and you probably "],["1471.38","like 25 percent and they just kept "],["1473.179","jacking these shots "],["1474.74","and anyways eventually they lost the "],["1477.08","game and afterwards I said to Tom I said "],["1480.14","Tom but that was crazy shot selection "],["1482.419","wasn't it

is "],["173.84","that accurate can someone judge and "],["177.599","still be good and loving "],["180.56","and the answer is yes yes if you have a "],["184.48","position of authority and responsibility "],["186.239","over an individual then yes you can and "],["188.959","probably you do let me give you some "],["192.76","illustrations uh a teacher for example "],["196.4","right Ardella teaching the Kids 2 + 2 is "],["200.879","five and your answer to that is "],["206.239","no that's wrong "],["210.04","Mrs fry who are you to "],["212","judge I mean that's not good to judge "],["214.84","somebody well the answer is uh M fry "],["217.2","says I'm the teacher I am the one who's "],["219.64","been given the authority and "],["221.599","responsibility to judge the answer and "],["223.84","me correcting a wrong answer and showing "],["226.2","you the right one is what a good teacher "],["229.319","does the definition of good is not based "],["232.04","on how you feel it's based on the right "],["235.36","answer the wrong answer is a bad answer "],["240.159","and the right answer is a good answer "],["243.599","right buy into that example at least "],["245.12","Ardella is with me on that onebody else "],["247.56","okay another example a parent right a "],["251.36","parent Jacqueline say to the boys if you "],["254.64","keep playing in the street you're going "],["256.04","to have to come inside I'm Not Gon to "],["257.16","let you play in the street anymore mommy "],["260.079","well who are you to impose your values "],["262.12","on me what about my

and the answer is well I'm the "],["276.4","mom right I'm the one with the authority "],["279.039","and the responsibility to guide and "],["281","protect and correct you if and me "],["284.68","correcting a dangerous activity that "],["286.52","could lead to uh bad consequences that "],["289.36","is what a loving parent does the "],["291.479","definition of love is not based on how "],["293.08","you feel it's based on what's right and "],["297.16","letting a child get hit by a car because "],["299.32","your negligent is that the wrong way to "],["302","parent yes it is give you another "],["304.88","example you don't like Jaclyn's with me "],["306.6","on that one okay a government if you "],["310.56","attack and hurt our citizens we will "],["312.88","declare war and

"],["329.36","people going to war against violent "],["331.479","oppressive outside forces is what good "],["333.88","leadership does the definition of "],["336.52","peaceful is not being a pacifist

this "],["359.36","question question how can a good God "],["361.96","command genocide is we have some flawed "],["365.96","presumptions some flawed presumptions "],["368.28","and I'm going to give you some "],["369.96","intellectual ammunition this morning "],["372.599","because uh everyone hears these types of "],["375.08","questions and we kind of want to know "],["377.199","how to deal with

"],["396.52","Israel to practice genocide that's a "],["399.16","flawed presumptions in that question "],["401.479","flawed presumption number one by the way "],["403.12","this material is coming from the uh from "],["406.56","uh ilana's Bible class he teaches 11th "],["409.199","grade Bible at Kings Christian academy "],["411.759","uh understanding the times is the title "],["413.84","of the book

"],["430.44","here but here's the flawed presumptions "],["432.52","there's a a whole list of them there and "],["434.319","I just thought this would be good for "],["435.36","you to have because when you're hearing "],["436.599","people throwing stuff at you you can "],["438.759","argue uh by holding the definitions "],["442.4","right he holds the definitions controls "],["444.68","the argument right so it's good to know "],["447.319","what you're faced with but here's the "],["448.759","flood presumption that I saw based on "],["451.16","this list the first flaw presumption is "],["453.44","a sweeping "],["454.919","generalization a sweeping generalization "],["457.72","where one presumes that a general rule "],["460.639","applies to all instances right we were

agreed on that we "],["470.72","voted on right and the answer is not "],["474.68","necessarily fla presumption number two a "],["478.199","faulty dilemma a faulty dilemma one "],["481.12","presumes that there are a certain number "],["483.159","of options and the person has to choose "],["485.72","between these options uh I also call "],["488.039","that a false dichotomy where you only "],["489.759","give this option or that option if if a "],["492.4","loving good person doesn't "],["494.72","condemn if you do then you're not a "],["497","loving good person you're a bad right so "],["499.68","that's a faulty dilemma and third flawed "],["503.599","uh presumption with our with that "],["505.68","question how can a loving God command "],["508.039","Israel to practice genocide is that it "],["510.199","is a complex question a complex question "],["513.399","it's a load of question that can't be "],["514.8","answered with the yes or no in order to "],["516.68","answer a

how can a "],["541.12","good god do "],["542.48","that how could he do that well it's not "],["545","as easy as yes he can or no he can't "],["547","it's a complex "],["549.88","question the presumed

now I'm going to have to give you a "],["562.279","thorough detailed answer in order to "],["564.44","prove that so you'll actually go there "],["566.12","with me but remember and I answer this "],["568.959","question "],["570.2","as is the case our world view here at "],["572.88","Faith Bible Church is that the Bible is "],["576.64","authoritative okay the Bible is "],["579.12","authoritative you need to understand "],["580.76","that not everyone who claims to be a "],["583","Christian has that type of world view "],["586.2","not everyone believes that the Bible's "],["587.839","authoritative matter of fact I do get a "],["589.6","letters from time to time from folks who "],["591.24","sit here in the church and they don't "],["592.519","like something I preached on and they'll "],["594.079","write me a letter with all the things "],["595.64","that I said wrong and uh they'll come "],["597.88","talk to me about it I say you have to "],["599.16","understand "],["600.16","our view my view is the Bible's "],["602.24","authoritative so if you you're going to "],["603.92","argue you don't like the Bible I get it "],["606.44","you don't like the Bible okay but that's "],["608.44","what I'm going to do every week so feel "],["609.72","free every week to write me a letter I "],["611.2","really don't care probably goingon to "],["612.399","throw in the garbage but I'm going to "],["613.92","teach you here's what the Bible says if "],["616.04","you don't like hearing it go find "],["617.6","another church because there's lots of "],["619.36","other churches that don't believe the "],["620.72","Bible and they'll teach you oh happy "],["622.64","happy times and rainbows and unicorns "],["625.64","and all kinds of crazy things like that "],["627.079","right that's fine they can do that but "],["629.36","we believe the Bible what it says is "],["631.68","what it means uh some other people think "],["634.2","that the the the majority what they say "],["636.24","is right is right right we'll take a "],["638.12","vote if the me and John and the other "],["640.44","Elders we get together and we vote we "],["642.639","decree therefore and then that's going "],["644.8","to be the rule that's how uh we choose "],["646.92","what's right or wrong or some people "],["648.6","will take it a step further and they'll "],["649.72","say it's my personal thoughts it's my my "],["651.88","feelings that's what's authoritative I "],["654.399","I've experienced this and I i' I feel "],["657.16","this and I've studied this for myself "],["659.68","and I did I mean people tell me this I "],["661.399","did all this research on this issue and "],["663.44","it's like I haven't right I haven't read "],["665.04","anything in my life on any of these "],["666.639","issues okay okay you read sure you got "],["669.32","it now and people tend to read what they "],["671.519","want to believe anyway so you know I "],["672.959","went to the internet and I looked this "],["674.44","up right okay uh they look themselves I "],["678.24","am the I am the I've rationalized and "],["680.04","I've come to the conclusion I am the "],["681.839","source of "],["683.639","authority but biblical Authority does "],["686.88","not start with the individual it doesn't "],["689.68","start with the traditions and decrees of "],["691.399","men biblical Authority says "],["694.72","God who created "],["697.32","everything probably knows more than "],["699.56","everyone else he is the "],["703.48","authority and God's word that he has "],["707.079","given to us is what he says on the "],["710.32","matter and thus is the final say like "],["713.8","the teacher or the mom as the final say "],["717.279","on what's right or wrong how do I know "],["719.079","this 2 Timothy "],["720.76","3:16 "],["722.88","Says you want people will be rattling us "],["725.079","off right that what all scripture is "],["726.88","given by inspiration of God and is "],["729.399","profitable for Doctrine for reproof for "],["733.16","correction for instruction in "],["735.92","righteousness all scripture including 1 "],["740.199","Samuel chapter 15 is inspired by God "],["745.04","that's what we believe so even though it "],["747.399","doesn't sound good or loving on the "],["749.519","surface we're not going

here's the first truth "],["762.72","you got to start with okay the first "],["765.36","thing we have to understand is that the "],["766.8","Bible teaches Romans 3: 10-2 there is "],["772","none righteous no not one there is no "],["776.279","one who understands there is no one who "],["778.6","seeks after God all have turned aside "],["782.24","together have become worthless no one "],["784.68","does good not even one all "],["789.24","have sinned and come short of the glory "],["793.199","of God question what does all "],["798.44","mean right all means all men all grown "],["803.72","adult "],["804.8","men but not women or children "],["809.399","all "],["810.36","means Romans 512 says therefore just as "],["813.72","Sin enter the world through one man and "],["815.56","death through sin and in this way death "],["818.8","I didn't realize how relevant this is "],["820.04","going to be for some folks this morning "],["821.8","but death comes "],["823.56","to all men who's going to die "],["828.24","all because all have sinned that's the "],["833.959","question why people die "],["835.839","because people have sinned all have "],["838.079","sinned from Adam on all of humanity is "],["842.6","under the wrath of God and deserves "],["846.48","death all of humanity deserves death "],["850.68","cuteness "],["852.56","aside

"],["864.639","Kevin feeling me on that one there is "],["866.04","equal for you all means all "],["870.519","it is the state that we are all in and "],["872.759","it is the Fate that we all suffer and "],["875.36","the age of someone's dying or the "],["878.32","circumstances behind their death doesn't "],["880.519","change the fact that we're all destined "],["882.279","to it we have to we have to challenge "],["885","our thinking on this because we will "],["886.44","think a baby dies a young person dies "],["889.959","and we will say oh they're so "],["892.839","young what a tragedy what a horrible "],["896.199","loss of life someone dies who's not n we "],["899.519","say well bless their hearts they live "],["902.24","such a long life what I mean what else "],["904.8","can you

"],["968.279","doesn't make it any less tragic death is "],["972.44","death if we suffer it because of our sin "],["976.279","we suffer it because of the wrath of God "],["978.639","just because we lived a long life and "],["980.48","we're tired doesn't make it good just "],["982.68","because someone accumulated a lot of "],["984.6","stuff and had a worldly success doesn't "],["986.68","mean

"],["251.76","always but sometimes it is "],["254.56","which leads me to this conclusion i'm so "],["257.6","very thankful for jesus "],["259.84","you know what i mean i'm not trying to "],["261.6","be cliche when i say that but think "],["263.36","about it "],["264","in the old testament they had all of "],["266.16","these laws "],["268.08","and i admitted to you last week that i'm "],["270.4","not really good "],["271.36","with laws or policies or details "],["274.88","i i i like saul i always tend to break "],["278.88","rules i i break rules i don't even know "],["281.199","exists back when i was in "],["282.479","college the dean of men would always "],["283.759","have me into his office and say rob you "],["285.52","broke this rule this was in the student "],["287.28","code and conduct manual oh "],["288.72","was that a rule my bad i didn't really "],["290.8","read the manual i just kind of skimmed "],["292.4","through it and "],["293.28","didn't bother to grasp what it said so "],["296.08","if i was back in the old testament "],["297.6","living under those laws i'd have been at "],["299.44","the tabernacle every day making an "],["301.84","offering i mean i would i would had been "],["304.08","an awesome farmer "],["305.36","because i would have needed to sacrifice "],["307.039","twice a day for "],["308.479","all the stuff that i seem to do wrong "],["310","that's a lot of livestock if you think "],["311.199","about it right if you got to have "],["312.479","something for every time you do that "],["314.24","would be non-stop slaughtering "],["316.4","cheap my home alone "],["319.52","and and that's what i mean when i say "],["320.88","i'm so thankful for jesus "],["322.88","because

"],["363.759","repercussions for unrepentant "],["366.24","sin my point is that some of us "],["370.72","as hard as we try we never seem to get "],["373.52","it all right "],["375.44","and we know if

maybe even ourselves but uh the "],["42.92","Lord is worthy of it all we're going to "],["45.2","uh wrap up our I don't know how long "],["47.6","we've been studying this but we've been "],["48.76","in this for a while this battle with the "],["50.399","Philistines we're in chapter 14 we're "],["52.6","going to be wrapping up this uh War "],["55.52","today it's nice to end a war don't you "],["57.879","think chapter 14 verses "],["62","31-46 I'm going to try to pull it all "],["64.36","together all that we've been looking at "],["66.72","and all the different things and "],["68.52","summarize it here so we can capture some "],["71.119","important applications for our own lives "],["73.32","so let's read verses uh 31 to 46 of uh "],["78.479","chapter 14 and then we'll dig into "],["80.88","what's happening here okay they struck "],["84.2","and the day of course is the Israelites "],["87.56","the Israelites struck among the philis "],["90.4","that day from mishmash to alalon and the "],["94.079","people were very weary the people rushed "],["97.36","G greedily upon the spoil took the sheep "],["100.119","and The Oxen and the calves slew them on "],["102.479","the ground and the people ate them with "],["104.92","the blood and then they told Saul behold "],["108.92","the people are sitting against the Lord "],["110.399","by eating the blood and he said you have "],["114.28","acted treacherously roll a great Stone "],["117.399","to me today and they just disperse them "],["120.439","Saul said disperse yourselves among the "],["122","people say to them each one of you bring "],["123.96","his ox and his sheep and Slaughter it "],["125.96","here and eat and do not sin against the "],["128.64","Lord by eating with the blood okay that "],["131.28","was a problem in the Old Testament law "],["133.04","that's true and by getting a stone and "],["135.44","slaughtering on the stone what has he "],["137","basically done he's gotten the animals "],["140.12","elevated so when he's they're "],["142.04","slaughtering them the blood is what "],["143.959","draining out in a way and getting out of "],["145.599","the body and the meat so then they could "],["146.959","eat it that was appropriate to the law "],["148.879","so that's what's going on there Saul "],["150.72","built an altar to the Lord and the first "],["153.04","altar that he built to the Lord verse 36 "],["156.28","okay then Saul said let's go down after "],["158.879","the Philistines by night and take spoil "],["160.56","among them until the morning light and "],["162.319","let us not leave a man of them and he "],["165.44","said and they said to they said do what "],["168.28","seems good to you so the priest said "],["170.64","let's draw near to God here Saul "],["174.08","inquired of God shall I go down after "],["176.4","the Philistines will you give them into "],["178.44","the hand of Israel but he did not answer "],["181.599","him God didn't answer him on that day "],["184.68","Saul said draw near here all you Chiefs "],["187.4","of the people and investigate and see "],["189.44","how this sin has happened today for as "],["192.159","the Lord Lives who delivers Israel "],["194.4","through though it is Jonathan my son he "],["196.92","shall surely die but no not one of all "],["200.56","the people answered him so what's "],["202.36","happened is is that Saul asked the Lord "],["205.519","for a request and the "],["207.599","Lord didn't answer him so now he he says "],["211.04","well God didn't answer me because "],["213.159","someone has sinned and we have to figure "],["215.4","out who has sinned and even if it's "],["217.159","Jonathan there somebody's going to pay "],["218.72","and somebody's going to get put to death "],["220.4","for this horrible "],["222.36","sin verse number 40 then they said to he "],["225.92","said to all of Israel you shall be on "],["228.08","one side and I and Jonathan my son be on "],["230.08","the other side and the people said to "],["231.28","Saul well you do see what's good to you "],["233.959","Saul said to the Lord the god of Israel "],["235.799","give a perfect "],["237.04","lot and Jonathan and Saul were taken but "],["239.92","the people escaped and Saul said cast a "],["243.56","lot between me and Jonathan my son "],["245.519","Jonathan was "],["246.599","taken then Saul said to Jonathan tell me "],["249.04","what you've done so Jonathan told him "],["252.04","this is what we talked about last week "],["253.4","Jonathan I tasted a little honey on the "],["256.4","end of my staff with my hand here I am I "],["258.56","must die Saul said may the Lord do this "],["261.639","to me more so for you shall surely die "],["264.84","Jonathan but the people said to Saul "],["267","must Jonathan die who has brought about "],["269.4","this great Deliverance in Israel far "],["271.32","from it as the Lord lives not a hair in "],["273.479","his head shall fall to the ground for he "],["277.08","has worked with God this day so the "],["279.479","people rescued Jonathan and he did not "],["282.6","die and it says Saul went on from "],["285.4","pursuing the Philistines and the "],["286.759","Philistines went their own "],["290.36","place summary of all that's going on "],["293.199","here when things do not go the way we "],["298.08","desire the way we want them to when God "],["301.88","does not answer us the way we expect it "],["305.72","sometimes it's because of what we're "],["307.88","doing and we can humbly accept that and "],["313.039","perhaps it realize come to the "],["314.84","conclusion that it's because we're out "],["316.199","of his will or we can find someone else "],["319.96","to blame it "],["320.919","on that's my conclusion of what's going "],["323.319","on here with Saul let's dig into this a "],["325.479","little bit it's been a very long series "],["328.52","chapter 13 to 14 getting through this "],["330.52","battle with the Philistines we started "],["331.96","it months ago this event that took place "],["334.4","in Israel it probably in of itself this "],["336.96","was only a couple of weeks that went on "],["338.72","here we know Saul had to wait a week "],["340.4","before he could go to battle and the "],["342.319","Philistines had invaded so it's probably "],["344.4","only been a few weeks but it's taken us "],["346.639","a while because there's all these "],["348.4","actions and responses of "],["350.24","people that that give us so many "],["352.24","insights there's there's so many "],["354.08","important lessons it allows us to "],["356.28","compare and contrast obedience versus "],["358.759","disobedience "],["360.28","Faith versus fear spirituality versus "],["364.919","carnality and as is the case with many "],["367.759","Bible stories it gives us an example of "],["369.599","both what to do and what not to do right "],["374.319","Jonathan is the example of "],["376.8","what to do some of you got that okay "],["379.44","very good Jonathan is what you should be "],["381.319","doing stepping out in faith right we saw "],["383.479","that in Jonathan being bold being honest "],["386","being courageous The More The Story Goes "],["388.599","On The more we see Jonathan "],["390.199","characterized by those attributes Saul "],["392.84","on the other hand is an example of what "],["396.12","not to do reacting to situations based "],["398.88","on feelings and emotional reasonings "],["401.84","being driven by emotions not biblical "],["404","principles giving ultimatums and "],["406.039","policies making knee-jerk reactions not "],["409.12","thinking through the consequences being "],["411.08","inconsistent in how he lives being petty "],["415","that's a good word for Saul he seems to "],["416.759","be Petty and the more we hear Saul speak "],["419.639","can look at his choices the more we see "],["422.319","he lacks wisdom and he lacks character "],["426.08","and then as we read through all this for "],["428.36","uh 1 Samuel chapter 13:14 look at all "],["430.52","this going on and if we're really honest "],["433.24","and and truthful we can pull back and we "],["436.28","can look at ourselves and then answer "],["438.72","this "],["439.879","question who am I more "],["442.72","like we want to be Jonathan we want to "],["446.039","be the faithful courageous wise one we "],["449.52","we all want to do good and "],["451.68","right that may we that may be how we "],["454.68","want to see ourselves but is that really "],["458.199","who we are is that what we really "],["462.599","do like "],["464.479","Saul most of us when we tell our stories "],["468.52","when we give an account of our actions "],["471.599","we cast ourselves in the role of the the "],["475.96","hero or the heroine whichever maybe we "],["480.879","are the main character in our life "],["482.759","stories and as such we view ourselves as "],["485.879","the the good guy or good person right "],["489.52","we're the good guys and anything that "],["492.479","oppresses me or troubles me or questions "],["496.12","me or causes the good guy grief is "],["499.159","obviously the the bad guy that's the "],["502.319","enemy of the good guy so everything else "],["503.96","is the bad guy right listen for it "],["506.159","though when you're talking to people "],["507.919","this week listen for how how they cast "],["510.599","themselves is the good God the one who's "],["513.36","right the one who's just you know I was "],["515.24","at the doctor's office and they made me "],["518.599","wait so long they did that to me I was "],["523.159","at the DMV and they they made me do all "],["526.279","this paperwork and put me through this "],["528.16","long process they just did that to me I "],["531.88","the good person was afflicted by the "],["534.56","evil doctor's office who was "],["536.36","diabolically trying to waste my time I "],["539.64","the person who's right has had to endure "],["541.88","the sufferings and the oppression of the "],["543.44","evil "],["546","DMV see Rusty's a good guy that's one "],["550.6","way to look at it or the other way I the "],["553.88","individual am no more important than "],["556.04","anyone else the people working here are "],["558.12","not personally trying to disrupt my life "],["559.8","they're really busy serving me and "],["562","everyone else in here and I who is "],["564.279","getting impatient is being selfish and "],["568.279","I'm illustrating lack of care my family "],["571.72","who comes into the house and leaves "],["573.44","their shoes all in the middle of the "],["575.24","doorway because they know that really "],["577.6","bothers me they're intentionally trying "],["579.68","to disrespect me they're intentionally "],["582.32","trying to drive me crazy because they "],["584.16","hate "],["586.04","me oh I think I've touched a nerve I'm "],["588.36","seeing a lot of looks here me the good "],["591.6","guy they the "],["593.32","enemy or perhaps my family when they "],["596.76","come to their house leave their shs in "],["597.88","the middle doorway because they're "],["598.92","preoccupied by thinking about something "],["600.2","else and they're not thinking about me "],["601.92","at all however if I tell them to pick "],["603.959","their shoes up and they cheerfully and "],["605.8","willingly do it it proves to me that "],["608.079","they do care about my wishes that "],["609.64","they're not rebellious hate "],["612.079","mongers me jumping to conclusions "],["615.48","attacking their character because they "],["617.399","don't succeed in following my rules and "],["619.279","remembering all of my "],["621.76","preferences says something about my "],["624.399","heart and my conditional love not theirs "],["629.72","first of all we see Saul's claim to "],["632.24","spirituality in verses 31-35 his claim "],["635.68","to spirituality is "],["638.519","what he sacrificed the animals properly "],["643.76","so nobody disobeyed the law of God by "],["645.88","eating blood in the meat ah Saul is now "],["649.8","spiritual he has succeeded in obeying "],["652","the law of "],["653.2","God let me just point this out to you "],["655.839","write this down and think about "],["657.639","it just because you obey in one area "],["662.44","does it mean you are the poster child of "],["665.88","obedience just the "],["667.959","thought just because you obey in one "],["670.079","area doesn't mean that you are the "],["671.56","totality the poster child of what "],["673.68","obedience to God looks like that's this "],["676","is f Saul's false spirituality look at "],["679.2","me I remembered not to eat blood and "],["682.48","meat there I was obedient I am truly on "],["686.279","God's side now I'm spiritual look at me "],["689.959","I preach good sermons this makes me "],["693.2","spiritual probably more spiritual than "],["695.56","any of you I wish you'd all just get "],["697.399","your act together and become as "],["698.76","committed as I am look at me I give more "],["701.8","time than anyone else around here I'm "],["703.32","working so hard I'm the I organize all "],["705.959","this stuff I'm the good "],["711.839","Gody we use our works to validate our "],["716.04","narratives that we're the good guy as we "],["718.76","can look at the good things that we do "],["720.16","and that equals us being the good guy "],["723.12","Saul starts his narrative with I'm the "],["724.8","good guy however last week we learned "],["729.399","that Saul had put the Army under a very "],["731.959","harsh poorly thought out what oath in "],["736.959","order right he said no eating until this "],["740.72","battle's over no eating till evening "],["743.04","we're going to battle all day we're "],["744.68","going to go non-stop we're going to go "],["746.48","hard he made it a Royal Decree "],["749.76","wasn't a practical it wasn't an "],["751.44","effective degree it did not Aid his "],["753.32","soldiers it did the opposite it what it "],["755.72","hindered them it made them hard pressed "],["758.92","it made them less effective at the the "],["762.68","battle Jonathan who is Saul's son the "],["767.48","true hero of the battle the one who "],["769.92","stepped out in faith to attack the Army "],["771.72","by himself because he believed God would "],["773","bless him and believe God's word he "],["775","didn't get the king's memo about the "],["777.04","whole not eating anything and when he "],["779.32","was exhausted in the battle and he was "],["780.8","in the woods he saw some honey and he "],["782.12","said I'll taste some honey and it "],["783.8","revived him and he did very well once he "],["786.24","got his strength back now I don't know "],["789.6","what it's like in your home but in the "],["792.199","mcnut household the males I should say "],["795.68","let me qualify this the ma mcnut males "],["799.279","they there comes a certain point when "],["800.68","our appetites take over our minds once "],["804.48","we get hungry the belly starts to take "],["807.24","over the brain and the craving short "],["809.639","circuit all other likes preferences "],["811.519","Concepts or "],["812.92","training it gets to the point that we do "],["815.92","not care what you cook or how it looks "],["818.6","or what it tastes just put something on "],["820.8","the table so we can eat it now and as "],["824.16","soon as the amen is spoken and as soon "],["826.24","as the food's within Striking Distance "],["828.079","the vultures swoop in and everything "],["830.44","gets eaten up all at once and when we're "],["832.88","in that mode that's what it looks like "],["834.279","really literally looks like "],["835.959","that Elana says my gosh you people act "],["841.16","like you haven't eaten in days to which "],["843.48","we all respond we're "],["846.6","hungry we don't care about decorum we "],["849.199","don't care about manners just feed us "],["851.959","before we pass "],["853.639","out so I can relate to the soldiers "],["856.36","that's just to me in our home but I can "],["858.079","relate to the soldiers think about it "],["859.639","they've been hiding for days they've "],["861.759","been surviving off rations they haven't "],["863.959","been able to cook anything because the "],["865.48","Smoke's going to give away their "],["866.759","positions "],["868.04","correct they have fought all day long to "],["870.88","exhaustion and not tasted one single "],["872.88","thing now they're finally allowed to "],["874.6","have something they're like the mcnut "],["877.079","they're just a tad bit desperate and "],["879.56","they're kind of chowing down on whatever "],["881.88","is in front of them as quickly as "],["883.48","possible but wait in their haste they "],["886","apparently have not butchered the "],["888.04","animals properly they're not supposed to "],["890.16","have blood in them and Saul says we've "],["892.56","got to honor the Lord we've got to not "],["894.56","violate his commands so he has "],["896.56","officially succeeded in being obedient "],["899","Obi he's now faithful to God so exhibit "],["902.44","a i spiritual I properly "],["905.68","Slaughter "],["907.72","C now what Saul is not being honest "],["910.399","about is the fact that his oath is what "],["913.48","put people in the desperate situation to "],["915.04","begin with he was not taking into "],["916.839","account their personal needs when he "],["918.279","swore the oath he was not considering "],["920.04","the consequences and he has burdened the "],["922.16","people he has wearied them but now all "],["924.16","of a sudden he becomes spiritually "],["926","minded he's appalled at Disobedience and "],["928.279","he's now in about honoring the Lord hey "],["930.839","Saul where was that level of dedication "],["933.88","prior to the battle when Samuel told you "],["937.199","to wait seven days until he arrived and "],["939.8","then he would do the sacrifice and then "],["941.36","they go to battle do you remember I know "],["942.56","it's a long time ago but do you remember "],["944.16","that's what happened in chapter 13 and "],["946.399","Saul did what he couldn't be bothered to "],["948.639","obey then he he he justified his reasons "],["951.959","for Disobedience when Saul said Samuel "],["954","said what have you done you have "],["955.399","disobeyed he was like oh the people did "],["957.279","it and it was everybody else "],["962.04","there was justifiable reasons then but "],["963.839","now that the people are famished and "],["965.04","desperate on account of his stupid oath "],["967.92","he's going to pull the law of God "],["970.759","car I think we've all seen people PLL "],["973.959","out the "],["974.92","Bible and use it when it is convenient "],["978.68","for them but maybe in other instances "],["981.92","they don't really suit them to follow "],["984.759","what God's word says they're not quite "],["986.199","so dogmatic you know what I'm talking "],["988.24","about seen that back when I was in Bible "],["991.519","College the uh School administration "],["993.759","made a very spiritual rule for us no "],["997.519","laundry is to be done on "],["999.72","Sundays very spiritual because Sunday is "],["1002.16","the Lord's day it's the day of rest and "],["1004.12","you cannot honor the Lord if you're "],["1006.12","doing laundry and in order to enforce "],["1008.88","this law they locked our laundry room up "],["1011.079","for us now I never had enough money to

"],["1303.159","someone else's sin now it doesn't say "],["1305.96","this in the text but I think someone had "],["1308.08","to have tipped Saul off about Jonathan "],["1310.039","eating the honey in

"],["1357.12","know about the oath and after he did it "],["1358.72","they said oh you shouldn't have done "],["1359.88","that and then he spoke up and said well "],["1362.12","you know what my dad really hasn't been "],["1363.88","all that clever and his policies have "],["1365.88","kind of hurt everybody and he kind of "],["1367.919","spoke that against his dad's leadership "],["1370.36","and

"],["1380.559","they haven't even investigate yet "],["1381.48","they've already said well I think it's "],["1382.679","Jonathan also you remember that it was "],["1385.919","Jonathan who stepped out

that Saul hates anyone getting "],["1397.2","more credit than him he hates it when "],["1400.08","someone steals his "],["1403.159","Spotlight so they go through this whole "],["1405.799","lot casting

"],["1414.72","you've done Jonathan told him I indeed "],["1418.799","tasted a little honey on the end of my "],["1421.6","staff that was in my hand here I am I "],["1424.72","must die Jon's like yeah

says go ahead you can kill "],["1445.76","me you'll notice that Jonathan's "],["1448.159","response is the opposite of when Saul "],["1451.08","disobeyed God when Saul deliberately "],["1453.44","disobeyed God what did he do you "],["1454.96","remember he made excuses and he blamed "],["1457.6","other people Jonathan doesn't make "],["1459.2","excuses he acts very nobly I broke the "],["1461","Earth oath you do what you got to do and "],["1463.12","Saul's adamant you will surely die he "],["1466.08","says to him verse number 4 "],["1469.399","or verse four verse 44 may God

chapter 14 uh last week in "],["28.96","chapter 14 we saw that great action "],["31.08","scene Jonathan taking on the entire Army "],["34.64","we learn how God shook the Philistines "],["36.879","and how they were "],["38.76","defeated and then we saw King Saul and "],["41.719","the uh Israelites who were in hiding and "],["44.28","the Israelites who were on the wrong "],["45.76","side all got on the right side and the "],["48.6","innumerable Philistine Army was chased "],["51.6","out of the country verse number 22 of "],["54.359","chapter 14 the men of Israel who are "],["56.84","hiding themselves in the Hill Country of "],["58.559","Ephraim heard that the philistin fled "],["61.239","even they also purered them closely in "],["64.36","the battle so the Lord delivered Israel "],["67.28","that day now you see them now in your "],["69.84","mind's eye you can see the scene now of "],["71.52","them the Army fleeing and the Israelites "],["73.759","all coming out and chasing them and "],["75.2","attacking them as they're running them "],["76.36","out of the country I guess I wondered "],["78.439","why would the Israelites chase after "],["80.32","them why not just let them leave you "],["82","know go home and get out of here why do "],["84.479","you want to chase them down well "],["86.56","honestly they're trying to kill as many "],["89.64","of them as possible so that the "],["91.84","Philistines will not have a chance to "],["93.52","regroup bottom line is is they want to "],["96","completely decimate the Philistine Army "],["97.88","so they'll never have to face them at "],["99.799","least no time soon not trying to be "],["102.28","hateful not trying to promote violence "],["104.36","but we need to remember that the "],["105.719","Philistines were the oppressors they "],["108.28","were the Invaders the theory the "],["111.2","principle of just War has to be "],["113.68","considered in this situation "],["116.039","self-defense against an armed attack is "],["118.88","a justification "],["120.36","for going to war Israel didn't start "],["122.719","this war nor did they have the ability "],["124.88","to win this war in and on themselves but "],["126.84","now that God has given them the victory "],["128.959","they're going to make sure that these "],["130.8","Philistine Invaders pay for their "],["134","attacks so we need to understand the "],["136.48","context and the necessity of the war "],["139.72","however observe Saul's attitudes and "],["143.239","decisions here going on into chap uh "],["145.879","verse 24 to 30 look at what happens next "],["149.12","in the action "],["150.36","it says in verse 24th men of Israel were "],["152.56","hardpressed on that day for Saul had put "],["156.519","the people under oath saying cursed be "],["160.72","the man who eats food before the evening "],["163.68","until I have Avenged myself on my "],["167.319","enemies so now so none of the people "],["170.599","tasted food and all of the people of the "],["173.08","land entered the forest and there was "],["174.959","honey on the ground when the people "],["176.8","entered the forest behold there was a "],["178.64","flow of honey but no man put his hand to "],["181.48","his mouth for the people feared the oath "],["184.4","but Jonathan who had not heard when his "],["186.48","father put the people under the oath "],["187.799","therefore he put the end of his staff "],["190.519","and uh it was on his hand and he dipped "],["192.799","it into the honeycomb and put his hand "],["195","to his mouth and his eyes were "],["198.12","brightened one of the people said oh "],["200.64","your father strictly put the people "],["202.599","under oath saying cursed be the man who "],["205.56","eats food today the people were weary "],["210.159","Jonathan said my father has troubled the "],["213.239","land see how my eyes have brightened "],["216.159","because I tasted a little of this honey "],["218.319","how much more if only the people had "],["220.68","eaten freely today of the spoil of their "],["222.799","enemies which they found for now the "],["225.56","slaughter among the Philistines has not "],["228.519","been "],["231.439","great according to Jonathan verse number "],["234.64","30 the right course of action is to "],["238.4","slaughter the "],["240.28","Philistines he agrees with the uh "],["243.84","strategy here to destroy the enemy he "],["245.76","has no problem with what Saul is trying "],["248.879","to accomplish but how King Saul is going "],["251.76","about it his method Jonathan does not "],["255.2","agree with that Saul's strategy in "],["257.959","essence if I can sum it up is no rest no "],["261.479","breaks no snacks until the job is done "],["266.08","cursed be anyone who tastes food before "],["268.88","the evening and until I've Avenged "],["273.039","myself on my "],["275.24","enemies because of this oath it says the "],["278.199","men of Israel were what verse number 12 "],["280.84","24 says the men were hard pressed "],["285","they're physically they're mentally "],["286.72","they're emotionally under pressure and "],["289.479","Saul has made this whole thing "],["293.56","overbearing he's overbearing first thing "],["296.6","that jumps out to me uh is Saul's "],["299.24","attitude the emphasis here seems to me "],["302.4","to be on himself Jonathan took on the "],["305.12","Philistines based on the promises he "],["307.68","read in the law of God the Lord has "],["310.36","given them into our hand Jonathan said "],["312.52","as he went on to attack but Saul on the "],["315.32","attitude's attitude is I will avenge "],["318.52","myself on my enemies that's a very "],["322.28","carnal attitude Saul's taking himself "],["325.639","way too seriously this battle this "],["328.24","Victory is all about who "],["330.6","him all about "],["332.479","him like he's somehow now the author of "],["335.96","The Revenge that his authority and his "],["338.56","direction is somehow essential and "],["340.88","responsible for this success which "],["343.52","really is the farthest thing from the "],["344.88","truth the reality is this Victory had "],["347.16","absolutely nothing to do with Saul's "],["349.12","leadership or Saul's ability it happened "],["352.12","despite Saul not because of Saul the "],["355.24","reality is Saul was stumbling around and "],["358.6","he arrived late to the party but now "],["361","he's all hard about it he's declaring "],["363.319","Oaths and he's giving ultimatums like "],["365.96","he's in

and apologized to me "],["481.8","for things that he did wrong learn to "],["484.4","say sorry to your children admit when "],["486.599","you're wrong show some humility and "],["489.599","learn to

"],["527.72","those kids you know and and they all "],["529.72","have a horror story about how over the "],["532","top I went in one of my uh coaching "],["534.839","rants but you know I've confessed it "],["537.399","I've accepted their criticism I've "],["539.079","apologize oliz so now when we talk about "],["541.24","these things it's not a painful "],["543.24","experience since we've resolved it we "],["545.48","just kind of laugh about it because "],["547.64","there's no pent up bitterness there's no "],["549.839","resentment anything they want to say or "],["552.24","need to say they can get it off their "],["555","chest they they they tell us we we try "],["557.519","to foster a transparent environment in "],["560.279","our home and if someone's been Hur or "],["562","offended we want to hear about it we "],["564.279","want to listen and we will apologize we "],["567.2","are accountable as a family we're "],["569.56","accountable to each other and here's the "],["571.839","secret to being able to do that to "],["573.92","create that "],["575.959","environment dad is not the final "],["580.279","Authority who's the final Authority "],["582.92","there you go God is the final authory "],["585.36","Authority God's word is the standard of "],["587.68","righteousness not moms and dads in our "],["590.279","home everyone is accountable to the word

our "],["601.88","words are not written in stone and we "],["604.519","can't take ourselves too seriously I'm "],["607.36","very concerned about some of my uh "],["610.32","family members who I seen take "],["612.64","themselves you know you get together "],["613.8","vacations and holidays you spend time "],["615.519","with your family and then you "],["617.279","go concerns there some of them are "],["620.079","taking themselves too seriously I think "],["622.519","they're their their families are going "],["624.68","to be hard pressed like it shows here in "],["627","this text I think that they're going to "],["629.32","provoke their children to wrath I've "],["631.48","seen parents drive their kids away from "],["634.24","themselves and even worse Drive their "],["636","kids away from God "],["637.88","how by making these kinds of policies "],["641.959","and ultimatums and saying this is "],["645.8","spiritual what I'm telling you is so "],["648.639","Godly but it's not necessarily spiritual "],["650.76","or Godly it's it's more so a personal "],["653.88","preference Saul's oath wasn't spiritual "],["656.839","or Godly it wasn't even a good ide "],["659.88","idea just learn to model humility young "],["664.04","parents because one day you're going to "],["666.8","make a mistake in front of your kids and "],["668.88","they're going to see it and if you won't "],["670.76","be honest with it and you won't confess "],["673.36","it to your kids then they won't know "],["675.44","what is truth anymore they won't know "],["677.839","right from wrong anymore same's true for "],["680.04","pastors same's true for church leaders "],["682.16","I'm not the final Authority I'm not the "],["684.56","ultimate Authority in this church God is "],["687.32","I don't walk around here saying I'm the "],["689.36","pastor and I expect this and I'm the "],["691.24","pastor and I want that nobody wants to "],["693.279","hear "],["697.16","that doesn't impress anybody you can "],["699.959","disagree with me I'm fine with that it's "],["702.16","not my church Jesus Christ is the head "],["705.959","the church however if I tell you "],["707.959","something that's biblical and it's "],["709.399","declared in the word of God and you "],["710.68","don't accept that then that's going to "],["712.04","be a little different but have you ever "],["713.92","seen someone make ridiculous rules that "],["716.48","are only important in their own mind but "],["718.24","they're really just more hurtful or a "],["719.72","nuisance to everyone else seen that and "],["722.639","when uh one of the church I I I preached "],["724.519","and served at the church secretary was "],["726.519","always trying to control everything and "],["728.32","everybody in the building uh by putting "],["730.68","up signs she saw something that she "],["733.88","didn't like she'd slap a sign on the "],["735.88","wall you come in and there be signs "],["738.079","everywhere and it' be like don't touch "],["739.68","the thermostat and don't let the kids "],["742.12","use these stairs and don't take these "],["744.519","styrofoam cops and don't use the paper "],["746.959","out of the photocopy room "],["750.6","so I played a little game with her she "],["752.48","put a sign up i' come behind her and "],["753.92","take it down she put a sign up I'd take "],["756.12","it down we played that little game for a "],["757.72","while eventually she got the message "],["760","that I wasn't going to let her "],["760.76","micromanage me and everyone "],["763.079","else kind of comical not really that "],["765.48","hurtful but even though I found it "],["766.959","entertaining I really wasn't trying to "],["768.199","annoy her I was trying to prevent her "],["770.079","from becoming overbearing on everyone in "],["773.199","the church but some people who do those "],["775.279","things they it's not just silly they "],["777.8","have real power they have real Authority "],["780.48","like a parent over a small child and the "],["782.959","kids don't have any power to take your "],["784.36","sign down and tell you you're being "],["785.839","silly or a king some sort of person with "],["789.56","a with a with a position of military or "],["793.04","law backing them I've seen folks I've "],["795.88","seen people Strongarm their kids into "],["798.079","madeup convictions that hurts them and "],["800.36","drives them away lots of young folks "],["802.8","that I grew up with have walked away "],["804.959","from church and walked away from God not "],["806.639","because of the Bible but because of the "],["808.16","man-made rules of their parents and I've "],["811.279","seen pastors be overbearing and "],["813.079","spiritually abusive and strong armed "],["815.56","people into Oaths and I'll tell you "],["818.12","something that could be a huge danger "],["820.44","and potentially destroy a

Samuel chapter 14 it "],["845.639","was all about the Lord winning the "],["847.199","Victory and as soon as Saul assumes "],["849.199","control it goes to be nothing but "],["851.519","carnality and these building projects "],["853.48","they have all kinds of pitfalls one of "],["854.959","the big pitfalls of course is the money "],["858.8","the money how are we going to raise the "],["861.04","money well we got to make sure "],["863.079","everyone's going to pay their fair share "],["865.079","and we're going to make Munch put his "],["867.16","name on that on that bill there at bank "],["869.48","so we got to make sure that everyone is "],["871.079","at the same level of commitment we we "],["873.36","better tighten everything up around here "],["875.199","so no food and no drinks and no coffee "],["878.079","we're gonna buy any more coffee around "],["879.32","here until we get this thing paid until "],["881.24","we win this "],["882.36","battle I want to take a

explain to us the "],["278.639","terrain he describes uh what it's like "],["281.82","there in the land and what Jonathan was "],["283.919","dealing with I wanted to show you a "],["286.199","picture this is a map but here's what "],["288","this land actually looks like this is "],["289.979","what he's talking about mishmash in the "],["292.38","area you got these valleys you've got "],["294.96","the the the the the cliffs you got all "],["297.479","kinds of rocks and and caves to hide him "],["300.06","and uh when the author tells us in "],["302.639","Chapter 13 that the

easy to do the Israelites are "],["313.38","practicing guerrilla warfare tactics "],["315.18","right now they're not engaging the "],["316.86","Philistine Army in the open because the "],["318.84","Philistines have got "],["320.58","too many people right there's too many "],["322.32","numbers and they get run all over so "],["324.36","they're hiding and they're waiting for "],["326.759","an opportunity of course the Philistines "],["328.68","we learned earlier that they they could "],["330.3","tell what Israel is doing and they're "],["331.68","trying to draw them out into battle so "],["333.6","they were sending out raiding parties "],["335.58","and trying to entice them to come out "],["337.44","and defend their their land uh by "],["339.66","raiding the area and

he's going to reveal himself "],["350.82","and he's going to trust that the Lord is "],["353.46","going to do something mightily through "],["355.5","them and he gives a sign he says you "],["357.9","know if they tell us to wait we'll wait "],["359.82","if he tells us to come on up then we're "],["361.919","going to go on up because we know that "],["363.6","the Lord is going to go

"],["376.74","that the Philistines are on "],["379.259","High ground and Jonathan is "],["382.44","somewheres "],["384.06","the opposite of up is been a while guys "],["386.52","I know this is tough

point of seeing them coming a "],["396.78","long ways away and they have the "],["398.88","advantage point of being able to attack "],["400.199","down it's much easier to attack down "],["402.72","it's much harder to go up right when "],["404.58","you're going to attack up you got to "],["405.9","travel up you got to fight gravity and "],["408.9","that's a lot more work I grew up in the "],["411.419","St John River Valley the St John River "],["414.36","Valley the land here in St Mary's is "],["416.34","much flatter from the land I grew up in "],["418.8","much more hilly where I come from John "],["421.199","you probably like that on your bicycle "],["422.58","because you get the big going Downs "],["424.74","would be fun the problem is why you "],["426.36","gotta go up right and that's a lot more "],["428.1","work to get back up those Hills we we "],["430.68","where we lived all of our Fields uh were "],["434.46","on hills and we played all of our Sports "],["436.74","on slopes I'm not talking about "],["439.259","Community fields that have been nicely "],["440.94","leveled I'm talking about back in the "],["443.039","day when any open field was a

you did something "],["451.199","like that so we always were playing on "],["453","Hills but you have to think about this "],["454.319","for a minute when you're playing your "],["455.58","sports on Hills the Hill's either "],["457.139","working for you or "],["459.66","against you that's right so when we play "],["461.699","baseball home plate the diamond was "],["464.039","uphill and we hit the ball downhill well "],["466.8","that's great for the "],["468.539","batter that's horrible for the "],["471.24","outfielder right because if the ball "],["472.319","gets by you you're running a long ways "],["474.9","and you really feel like Babe Ruth or "],["476.58","something if you can kill the ball all "],["478.319","the way down the hill now that was a "],["480.539","little bit of a challenge soccer was "],["481.979","horrible on a hill "],["483.24","right you clear the ball out he's just "],["484.919","gone forever football we wouldn't play "],["487.02","like one team downhill one team uphill "],["489.24","we play kind of half and half so "],["491.22","football if you're going to line up you "],["492.78","wanted to line up uphill if you're going "],["494.22","to run a slant

you're really slow and running "],["503.699","downhill you were really quicker now "],["505.379","here's an interesting one road hockey "],["507.479","which way do you think you want to play "],["508.68","Road hockey "],["510.9","actually you want to be going uphill "],["512.58","because downhill the ball gets away from "],["514.68","you really fast and you lose it a lot "],["516.06","but when it's uphill you can do a lot of "],["517.5","moving and you take slap shots "],["520.38","think about that for a minute slap shots "],["522.479","on gravel "],["525.06","right I mean you know you got to be "],["526.92","tough to play that because not only are "],["528.24","you stopping the ball you're stopping "],["529.68","all the gravel too I mean back in the "],["532.26","day kids nowadays they don't know what "],["534","it was like back in our day we had to "],["536.04","adjust for the terrain when we played "],["538.38","Sports here's Jonathan he has to adjust "],["540.12","to the

would have "],["577.38","elaborated and made a little uh lively "],["579.959","than that but what's what's what do you "],["581.94","see there he's climbing up this hill "],["583.5","they're waiting

his point Jonathan "],["888.54","believed that God is Not restrained to "],["890.94","save by many or by few and because of "],["894.899","that belief he stepped out into the "],["896.94","fight and

"],["929.339","out oh Jonathan the armor Bearer are "],["931.019","they've gone and then Saul said to Aisha "],["934.139","uh bring the Ark of the the Ark of God "],["936.72","here for the Ark of God

"],["995.339","and then he also had this priest ahija "],["997.74","with him and the author takes the time "],["1000.32","to point out to us in verse number three "],["1002.06","that this priest was wearing an ephod "],["1006.92","that he was wearing this ephot "],["1010.759","the ephod was a Priestly garments "],["1013.82","but Not only was it just clothing "],["1017.3","what came along with that garment was "],["1020.18","ability to seek a word from the Lord the "],["1023.54","pre it's it the Bible communicates to us "],["1025.579","that the priesthood was wearing the "],["1027.079","ephod could and would hear from the Lord "],["1031.1","so the importance of that detail is that "],["1033.919","King Saul has this priest with the ephod "],["1036.799","meaning that

"],["1045.62","listen if he would have asked "],["1047.9","also it says in verse number 18 that "],["1050.179","Saul called for the Ark of the Covenant "],["1052.64","the Ark of the Covenant was with

"],["1074.72","trying to point out to you with those "],["1075.919","details is this Saul had "],["1078.88","599 more men than Jonathan "],["1082.4","Saul had the covenants of God Saul with "],["1086.419","the priest in the with the ephod had the "],["1088.52","ability to hear directly from God "],["1091.64","and despite all of that Saul has no idea "],["1096.86","Saul has no clue what's

"],["36.079","that the the kingdom will be taken "],["38.879","to someone else or someone who will be a "],["41.68","man after god's own heart and will obey "],["43.44","god "],["44.399","after "],["46.96","he then grabbed the crowd and tore it "],["49.12","off of saul's head he "],["51.44","called for the guards to come arrest him "],["53.6","and drag him away "],["56.48","call for god to

a "],["72.56","what do you do "],["77.92","samuel "],["79.28","leaves them and walks away "],["82.64","huh "],["84.08","you know sometimes "],["86.159","you have to do that "],["88.64","that doesn't sound very kind and maybe "],["91.68","not very christian you know because "],["93.439","we're supposed to help and we're "],["94.72","supposed to support and comfort and "],["97.439","counsel and teach and instruct people "],["99.84","yes we are to do all that however "],["102.479","if someone "],["104.159","doesn't want your counsel "],["106.24","and they don't want to obey the word of "],["109.119","the lord there comes a point where you "],["111.28","have to "],["114.079","walk "],["115.119","away "],["116.72","and leave them to do it on their own "],["120.32","on our way to canada one christmas boys "],["123.36","were much younger "],["124.719","and i'm not sure why but for whatever "],["126.56","reason we rented a car for this trip "],["129.44","generally on "],["130.8","that type of long trip people get bored "],["133.92","and start instigating "],["136.319","and antagonizing "],["138.48","which then leads to "],["140.4","screaming "],["141.52","and fighting "],["143.36","and uh it's usually not too bad when we "],["145.36","have the minivan or the car with "],["146.959","everyone has their own seats but for "],["148.64","some reason we were all crammed into "],["150.08","this small space now i don't know about "],["152.08","you but uh i have a hard time traveling "],["155.36","with a bunch of screaming and fighting "],["157.44","going on behind me i know it's a long "],["159.519","drive and i know you're bored but "],["161.76","screaming and fighting really doesn't "],["162.959","make the trip any longer faster you "],["165.12","notice that "],["166.56","so i don't care for that and we've "],["167.84","talked about this many times but on this "],["169.68","trip because they were just touching "],["171.44","each other "],["172.72","non-stop poking non-stop it was so "],["176.8","much worse and it was louder and finally "],["181.12","in the middle of nowhere in maine which "],["184.239","is an accurate description of pretty "],["185.92","much the entire state of maine "],["188.319","i jerked the car into the silver road i "],["191.44","slammed on the brakes i turned around to "],["194.48","face three little boys and said "],["197.28","you'll either be quiet "],["199.36","or you will get out "],["201.76","and you can walk "],["203.519","to canada "],["206.08","here's the options "],["207.84","obey "],["209.12","or be left on the side of the road now "],["210.879","how many fathers have done this very "],["212.799","same thing thank you very much yes you "],["215.12","know i know who you are now probably "],["217.519","everyone understood that i was not going "],["220","to do that however "],["222.799","do you really want to call dad's co-op "],["226.4","do you really want to take that chance "],["230.64","actually that is "],["232.56","one of our forms of discipline as a "],["235.2","church body everyone who is part of the "],["238.48","chur the body of christ has to choose "],["240.799","for themselves how they will live their "],["242.879","lives we talked about that last week "],["244.56","whether you want to be obedient or "],["246.4","disobedient to god's

"],["257.919","of the "],["259.44","suv and drive you to the church dungeon "],["262.16","and lock you up in the church dungeon "],["264.16","because we don't have one "],["267.44","i put one on the wish list for the new "],["270","building but the elders did not think "],["272.4","that was a good idea so we can't use "],["274.56","that form of punishment the main thing "],["276.639","we do for discipline according to the "],["279.36","jesus words in the book of matthew is "],["281.28","exactly what i offered the boys that "],["284.639","cold afternoon in maine i will let you "],["287.6","out and you can stay here by yourself "],["292.16","you want to disobey "],["293.759","then we will just "],["295.12","leave you "],["296.4","in that state and move away from you we "],["299.84","can't force anyone to obey but we can "],["302.72","distance ourselves "],["304.639","from disobedience which is what samuel "],["307.6","does with saul what does that mean for "],["310.72","saul now "],["313.28","i mean he did the sacrifices and the "],["315.44","offerings and he's wanted to get the "],["317.039","battle started with the philistines he's "],["319.039","ready to go at them so this means what "],["321.52","he can "],["323.759","go do whatever he wants if he wants to "],["325.52","go take on the philistines have added "],["328.16","saul "],["329.28","you can start that battle but "],["331.6","you're on "],["333.6","your own "],["335.68","he has no knowledge if god is going to "],["337.68","help him or not because the messenger of "],["339.759","god has "],["341.36","walked away from him so now saul has a "],["344.08","massive philistine "],["345.759","invasion samuel the voice of the lord "],["347.919","has walked away from him and he's left "],["349.759","to deal with it on his own do you think "],["351.44","this was a good move for saul do you "],["353.68","think that saul's 600 man army versus "],["356.56","the innumerable philistine army is going "],["359.039","to be successful you know when you "],["361.52","reject god's word and you decide to "],["364.479","figure out things on your own guess "],["366.639","whose power and strength and wisdom and "],["368.56","knowledge you have to help you now "],["371.52","you have "],["372.96","just your own "],["374.96","lots of people do the exact same thing "],["377.36","that saul does they want to step away "],["379.52","from god do things their way but now you "],["383.039","have to be powerful enough to take on "],["385.6","the world the flesh and the devil on "],["388","your own you have to stand against the "],["390.16","enemy of our soul and all of the forces "],["392.56","of darkness in your own "],["394.56","strength and knowledge and even though "],["397.199","the devil's been lying and manipulating "],["399.199","and deceiving people for thousands of "],["400.88","years and even though god has plainly "],["403.039","communicated all this to us there are "],["405.12","those who think i know better than "],["407.36","everyone else "],["409.36","i know more than god "],["412.08","i know what's best and the devil eggs "],["414.72","them on sure you do "],["417.12","you're so smart "],["419.52","you you you don't need god you don't "],["421.52","need the bible or church you can decide "],["424.8","what's best walk away "],["427.919","you can do it on your own "],["430.96","that's "],["431.919","always his plan "],["434.24","to get you "],["435.44","by yourself "],["437.199","on your own "],["439.039","family and church "],["441.84","has "],["442.96","the god ordained leadership has the "],["445.84","network of people that is here to help "],["447.759","you and teach you and hold you "],["449.28","accountable the enemy always wants to "],["451.84","separate you from all of that "],["455.199","where he then can just have you "],["457.919","versus him "],["459.36","and all of his entourage of demons and "],["461.84","weapons "],["463.12","trust me "],["464.479","you don't want to be "],["466.319","on your own "],["468.72","next we see here in this passage the "],["470.639","author sets the stage to show us how bad "],["473.36","the situation is going to be "],["475.52","talks in verse number 16 saul and his "],["477.52","son jonathan and all the people who were "],["479.28","present with him were a geba a benjamin "],["481.759","a philistines worth mishmash we know all "],["483.599","that and now it says what verse 17 that "],["485.84","the philistines uh raiders came out of "],["488.479","the camp of the philistines in three "],["489.84","companies and they're moving in "],["491.84","different directions or for the land of "],["493.84","shula and another company to beth horon "],["497.44","another company towards the border "],["499.199","overlooking the valley "],["500.96","zeboween towards the wilderness and "],["503.68","we've talked about this before as "],["505.12","another detail to know how bad it is "],["507.28","there's no blacksmiths in the area "],["509.44","the land of israel the philistines had "],["511.28","said otherwise the hebrews will make "],["512.8","swords or spears so all of israel went "],["515.039","to the philistines to get uh sharpened "],["517.36","his plows share or lager as acts or as "],["519.839","whole and the charge was two-thirds of a "],["521.68","shekel for plowshares matlock's forks "],["523.839","and axes and to fix hoes "],["526.399","so it came about the day of the battle "],["527.76","neither was there a sword or a spear "],["529.519","found on the hand of any of the people "],["530.8","who were with sawler jonathan they were "],["533.04","found with saul and jonathan and the "],["534.399","garrison the philistines went up to the "],["536","past mishmash so what we see here the "],["539.2","author said in the stage first of all we "],["540.8","see that the enemy has worked very hard "],["543.12","to disarm "],["544.72","the nation of israel "],["546.56","it was unaffordable that's basically the "],["548.24","summary it was unaffordable to get "],["550.08","anything sharpened and there's no access "],["553.04","to weapons of war "],["554.88","that's always the strategy used to keep "],["559.12","people under control "],["561.04","don't allow them to have weapons "],["564.88","the nazi party "],["567.279","implemented strict "],["569.44","gun "],["570.32","control laws "],["572.08","disarm the people legally "],["574.72","before they begin the holocaust did you "],["577.279","know that "],["579.76","i wonder rob this is something you "],["581.519","probably researched but if you take time "],["583.519","to to look this up "],["585.44","and i did this week "],["586.959","you'll see you'll learn that all the gun "],["591.2","restriction laws in this country "],["594.24","originally were a result of racist "],["596.48","attitudes "],["597.68","that's where they all originated the "],["600","laws were there to keep the weapons out "],["603.04","of the hands of minorities "],["605.92","why "],["606.88","because it's easier to control and "],["608.72","dictate to people who are unarmed "],["611.44","they're unarmed it's much easier "],["613.519","it's not so easy to oppress "],["615.76","armed people see the founders "],["619.12","gave all citizens the right to bear arms "],["625.2","for a good reason "],["626.88","and anytime someone tries to take that "],["629.12","right away from you it's because they "],["632.32","need to control you "],["634","and they can't do it so well "],["636","if you're armed "],["637.519","so the bible is very accurate where it "],["640","says there's nothing new "],["641.839","under the sun "],["642.959","what has been done before "],["645.12","will be done again "],["646.88","and you just see these cycles and do we "],["648.8","see it happening again "],["650.48","the same stuff so then you have to "],["651.92","realize what happened in history when "],["654.56","that stuff happened "],["656.48","just saying i'm being political just "],["658.24","saying "],["659.76","rob learn your history right learn your "],["661.44","history what is it a heritage say it "],["664.079","it's a great thing "],["668.079","a heritage loss "],["671.92","i love that i love that incidentally "],["674.8","american truth is going to be coming out "],["676.16","in video real soon "],["678.079","any day now just like our building "],["679.519","project any day now "],["681.6","two big things happening around here "],["684.56","you know folks the enemy of your soul "],["687.44","the devil does not want you "],["689.839","to have the sword of the spirit "],["692.56","the most dangerous thing to him is not "],["694.56","you holding a shotgun it's you hiding "],["697.279","the word "],["698.48","in your heart "],["699.92","it's you knowing the truth and speaking "],["702.72","the truth it's you reading and living a "],["706.56","biblical worldview the devil wants you "],["710.079","disarmed don't read that don't study "],["712.8","that don't attend a church that teaches "],["715.519","it people this is your weapon "],["719.279","and "],["720.079","if you don't know it and you don't "],["722.399","follow it and believe it then you are "],["724.72","defenseless and you are no threat at all "],["727.519","to the enemy "],["729.36","you know what we're doing here every "],["730.24","week basically "],["731.68","we're getting armed and dangerous "],["733.92","amen that's right we're getting armed "],["736.079","and dangerous we're getting trained "],["738.48","and we're learning how to use the "],["740.24","weapons the spiritual weapons what is "],["742.72","our spiritual weapons it's "],["744.88","prayer "],["745.92","and it's "],["746.959","the reading of the word of god and "],["748.32","incidentally another one i would say is "],["749.92","worship its praise "],["751.519","when we shout the praises "],["753.92","that disrupt the enemies "],["756.8","of this world so these are our weapons "],["759.279","verse number 17 and 18 "],["762.24","it shows us that these raiders are going "],["764.079","out "],["764.8","philistine raiders they're sending out "],["766.399","their priorities we've observed before "],["767.92","that prior to the seven days before "],["769.92","samuel comes to saul really nothing was "],["771.68","happening in the text because they were "],["773.04","kind of camped there and waiting but now "],["775.04","something's starting to happen the "],["776.48","raiding parties are going out and "],["777.92","basically they're plundering they're "],["780.079","attacking and there's no resistance "],["782.399","because all of israel's troops have "],["784.16","deserted or they're all in hiding saul's "],["787.04","only got 600 men originally he had 3 000 "],["790","and these rating priorities are put the "],["791.6","pressure on saying do something israel "],["793.76","do something if you don't do anything "],["795.839","then we're just going to destroy and if "],["798.24","you stay in hiding when you come out "],["800.16","there's not going to be anything left or "],["801.839","you're going to have to what you're "],["803.36","going to have to come out and fight us "],["804.959","and in which case you don't stand a "],["806.32","chance because you only got 600 people "],["808.48","and 600 that's not big enough our army "],["810.959","you need way more than that to save "],["813.2","israel the last time when they fought "],["815.36","the ammonites they had 330 000. so this "],["818.88","is impossible is it not there's no way "],["821.44","that you could save the nation with 600 "],["826.399","or is there "],["828.72","let's go to chapter 14. "],["832.24","chapter 14. "],["834.32","now the day came when jonathan the son "],["836.639","of saul "],["838.079","said to his young to the young man who "],["840.32","was carrying his armor come let us "],["842.16","forward

"],["557.6","to make their english translation i'm "],["560.399","not sure why perhaps they felt that 30 "],["564.08","000 was a really big number and reason "],["566.72","that 3 000 maybe would be

here's why i use "],["576.64","the nsab "],["578.399","in my ministry because the translators "],["581.279","of this english version don't deviate "],["584.32","from the hebrew text "],["586.32","this "],["587.76","is my "],["588.959","copy of the hebrew text if you want to "],["593.04","come look at it you want to get a "],["594.32","close-up on that guys "],["596","you can come read this "],["597.6","good luck with that later on "],["599.839","this is from the leningrad codex which "],["603.279","is the oldest complete "],["605.519","manuscript of the hebrew bible "],["608","this "],["608.8","hebrew text says "],["610.8","30 000. "],["612.88","i spent three years at seminary where i "],["615.6","studied these ancient languages and my "],["617.6","professors did their very best to teach "],["620.16","me how to read these

the "],["631.6","sake of convenience i rely "],["634.24","on my english translation saves me a lot "],["637.36","of the time "],["640.16","but there are lots of english "],["641.44","translations for

and how we got there with "],["662.079","that anyways back to the scene in samuel "],["666.32","saul's facing this massive army and all "],["669.04","the people are fleeing and he can't do "],["671.519","anything because samuel told him he "],["673.839","needed to "],["675.2","wait at gilgal for "],["677.76","seven days and then according to "],["680.16","deuteronomy the priest was going to come "],["682.079","and make the offerings to the lord so "],["683.92","saul's there waiting and the soldiers "],["686.24","are with him are trembling and every day "],["689.279","more defect "],["690.64","and every day his force gets less and "],["693.12","less "],["693.92","and every day saul gets more anxious i "],["696.56","mean why the heck do we have to wait "],["698.48","seven days anyways what if the "],["700.24","philistines attack us in this seven day "],["702.48","period what's interesting "],["705.12","well if you've never thought about this "],["706.72","that despite this massive army that the "],["708.8","philistines have "],["711.279","what have they done so far "],["713.839","they haven't attacked they've just "],["717.04","camped it's got a really big campsite "],["719.519","over there at mishmash that's all that's "],["720.959","happened so far "],["722.56","i wonder why "],["724.64","do you think saul "],["726.399","wondered why as well "],["729.12","maybe "],["730.399","maybe it's because the last time the "],["732.079","philistines tried to wipe the israelites "],["734.639","out god thundered with the great thunder "],["737.68","and they were so paralyzed that they "],["740.079","were completely demolished remember that "],["742.48","story maybe because the last time the "],["744.959","philistines captured the ark of the "],["746.72","covenant and took it back to the cities "],["748.72","of their gods and put it in their temple "],["750.959","their god fell on his face and his head "],["753.6","broke off you remember that yeah maybe "],["755.92","that's why uh and then the whole plague "],["758.16","hit the cities and all the cities of the "],["759.839","of the philistines they were dropping "],["761.519","like flies and they were dying and they "],["762.959","said please get that stupid thing out of "],["764.72","here and they shipped it back to the "],["766.639","land of israel so yeah they have six "],["768.48","thousand horses and yeah they got thirty "],["770.32","thousand chariots and yeah they have an "],["772.399","army that is great as the sands of the "],["775.279","sea "],["776.32","but maybe their leaders aren't sure that "],["778.32","they can win "],["780.079","not because they're scared of israel but "],["783.04","because they're concerned about the god "],["786.8","of israel who keeps kicking their rear "],["790","ends every time they go up against them "],["792.88","my guess is that's why they've been "],["795.12","sitting there all week and they have yet "],["797.279","to do anything why is it that we worry "],["800.24","and panic about the stuff that said that "],["802.16","god says he's going to take care of "],["804.56","why is that "],["806.639","sometimes we get all excited and we "],["808.72","start panicking what are we going to do "],["810.399","about this how are we going to fix this "],["812.48","how are we going to win this battle how "],["814.16","are we going to afford this stuff how "],["815.76","are we going to survive this crisis and "],["818.079","really what god is saying to us is "],["820.8","you don't "],["822.88","you don't have to win and you don't have "],["825.36","to fix it and you don't have to afford "],["827.519","it and you don't have to survive it you "],["829.6","don't have to do anything because i've "],["833.36","got this "],["835.68","you hear what god is telling you this "],["837.44","morning church "],["838.8","we've got a god who's "],["841.36","he's got it "],["842.72","he's got it "],["845.36","if he said wait seven days and samuel "],["847.68","will sacrifice and then you're going to "],["849.12","win the war then that is exactly exactly "],["852","what's going to happen and samuel 2. "],["853.76","he's not worried he that's his attitude "],["856","because samuel's been doing this for 40 "],["857.92","some years he's got all this experience "],["860.72","i remember "],["862","when

"],["34.559","to look at uh to be aware of wolves and "],["36.96","sheep's clothing is something that uh "],["38.84","Paul warns the New Testament Church "],["40.48","above but the kind of woke up

"],["83.32","that he had he decided now that he needs "],["85.479","to give up on drinking he said I got to "],["88.799","put that out of my life he's a believer "],["90.6","in Jesus all along but he said this is "],["92.84","becoming a stronghold for the enemy a "],["95.399","place where the devil is getting in and "],["97.32","controlling me and that's always dear "],["99.72","brothers and

"],["159.28","obvious but wounds or hurts things that "],["163.44","have been done against me that's no "],["165.599","fault of my own it seems justifiable "],["169.28","that I should be bitter that I

"],["243.04","churches because they're hurt don't they "],["245.2","because they've been wounded or offended "],["247","and the division caus in that he uses it "],["249.12","to divide our families

"],["267.759","the devil to get a foothold in one area "],["270.479","it doesn't just stop with that area it "],["272.759","becomes now a base of operation where he "],["274.68","tries to take more and more control over "],["277.96","us and that's why Jonathan had to attack "],["281","that Garrison at geba the Philistines "],["283.44","never should have been allowed to set it "],["285.36","up to

too they they will "],["512.279","participate but you know sometimes they "],["514.039","have other things to do so they don't "],["515.76","want to hang in there quite as long as "],["517.8","Mom and Dad do and listen to all of our "],["520","boring stories so basically what happens "],["521.88","we'll say you know well how is "],["523.039","everyone's day and they will go first "],["525.48","and they will talk about the things that "],["526.76","related to them and what happened and "],["529.08","what trouble they got into in class and "],["530.88","all that and then they've eaten and "],["532.68","they've talked themselves out and and "],["534.24","then they excuse themselves and they "],["535.56","will go on about their evening but just "],["537.76","because they've laugh doesn't

um so uh we "],["548.64","generally have a little more you know "],["549.72","we're long-winded uh now I don't like "],["553.68","repeating myself when I'm telling "],["556.44","stories if anybody else is like me I "],["558.48","just find this aggravating if I'm going "],["559.959","to talk about an account or tell a story "],["562.16","about something that happened in my day "],["564.04","I want to tell the story and I don't "],["565.48","want to have to keep repeating the "],["566.68","details anybody anybody feel me on this "],["568.92","okay right so uh Rick is notorious for "],["571.68","this uh he Rick will be done his supper "],["574.839","he's told his stuff he's now checked out "],["577.04","of the conversation he's going over to "],["578.64","the sink he's cleaning up his dishes "],["579.959","he's moving on and I'll be telling a "],["581.92","story about my day and uh and then all "],["584.68","of a sudden some one of the details all "],["586.44","of a sudden he catches his attention and "],["588.44","and it's interesting and he goes oh wait "],["590.44","what what happened who said that what "],["592.839","what was going on and I'll say Rick if "],["596.399","you want to hear my story sit down pay "],["599.68","attention and you can hear it but don't "],["602","come in mid discussion and interrupt "],["604.88","with a whole bunch of questions of "],["606","things I've already explained that you "],["607.2","didn't catch because you weren't paying "],["608.72","attention and usually says okay never "],["610.16","mind and goes about his day because he "],["611.88","really doesn't want to take the time to "],["613.56","hear the whole story you can hear things "],["616.16","in "],["617.2","passing but not really be "],["619.959","listening correct that's not what the "],["623.36","Hebrew word "],["624.64","shama translated heard means when it "],["627.959","says everyone heard shama means to hear "],["632.16","intellectually with implication of "],["635.88","attention and "],["637.36","obedience okay shama is kind of what we "],["639.92","do here in church for the most part "],["641.76","we're not sitting here yakking amongst "],["643.88","ourselves looking at our phones "],["646.079","chitchatting away and then maybe you are "],["647.88","paying attention or something catches "],["649.6","your attention up here no for the most "],["650.959","part you all sit quietly and you listen "],["653.6","attentively I say for the most part "],["655.6","because I've sat through enough

do a little bit "],["864.72","of trash talk and verbal uh intimidation "],["868.44","what is typical what do you typically "],["871","say about somebody what's Trash Talk "],["873.279","101 you exactly your team stinks that's "],["879.279","what you say right your team I'm gonna "],["881.24","say this and don't tell Iana because "],["883.04","she'll be upset at me she'll get a third

that's "],["894.16","what's going on here think about it "],["897.24","they're not it says I know the text says "],["899.36","Israel is odious but are the Philistines "],["903.24","saying Thou Art odious "],["906.399","Israel is is that is that the attitude "],["909.199","that that we find you distasteful and "],["911.8","offensive to our nostrils no no I need "],["915.639","you to do the emotional hermeneutic "],["917.68","right interpret the text emotionally "],["920.199","what are they saying it's a lot Crasher "],["923.32","and harsher than odius isn't it you guys "],["925.6","are not all right there we go the "],["928.16","Israelites on the other hand when they "],["930.8","hear about this how are they responding "],["933.199","to the "],["934.399","news yeah that's right yeah we we got in "],["938.48","a fight at giba and we and we beat them "],["942.199","we kicked them out of their Garrison "],["944.16","well it's about time those guys have "],["946.199","been pushing their luck around here for "],["947.72","and for a long time and now that we got "],["949.6","a king and now that we got an army we've "],["951.839","already beaten the ammonites look out "],["954.72","we're going to take you out Philistines "],["957.079","so that's kind of the details that are "],["959.56","going on here in verse number four uh "],["962.48","and and also you see another interesting "],["964.319","detail in verse four where it says that "],["967.279","Israel "],["968.92","heard who smoke the "],["972.839","Gars yeah text says Saul but we learned "],["975.72","last week it was who it was "],["978.88","Jonathan maybe that's a technicality I "],["981.319","mean after all Jonathan is Saul son and "],["983.319","he's following his father's orders but "],["986.519","still that's an interesting detail I I "],["989","think there's a something some subtle "],["992.8","exposure of Saul's character in that "],["995.6","detail seems to me Saul's taking "],["998.92","credit for something Saul likes to take "],["1002.759","credit Saul likes praise but what we're "],["1006.839","going to see as we go through our "],["1008.079","character study in Saul he's not really "],["1010.12","good at taking "],["1012","responsibility you time and time again "],["1013.92","you'll see he likes the praise of the "],["1015.44","people he wants to look good in the "],["1016.759","people's eyes but when something's bad "],["1019.079","going on he tends to deflect and throw "],["1021.48","the blame onto other people and uh as a "],["1024.199","coach sometimes I'm teaching my teams uh "],["1027.6","when something bad happens and and they "],["1029.559","all want to start getting down and they "],["1031.079","all want to the you know everyone wants "],["1032.959","to blame the goalie when the goals get "],["1034.959","scored you know and the goalie gets ugly "],["1036.839","at the defense cuz things get scored and "],["1039.199","and uh and then you know the defense is "],["1040.88","like well the offense didn't get back in "],["1042.52","help you know and as a coach you try to "],["1044.4","teach your players good teammates take "],["1047.36","responsibility for other people's "],["1048.919","mistakes you don't start casting blame "],["1051.2","and attacking your teammates you need to "],["1053.16","say well what could I have done better "],["1054.6","and how can I do better and it's my "],["1056","fault I'll I'll work harder on it and "],["1058.16","Saul isn't a good teammate he likes to "],["1060.28","take praise when things go well and he "],["1062.28","likes to cast blame when things go "],["1064.64","poorly he wants the nation to hear that "],["1067","he beat the Philistines and perhaps he "],["1069.08","did but the last time when they had "],["1070.96","their battle against the ammonites and "],["1072.559","after they won the battle and they came "],["1074.24","back and they were all celebrating who "],["1076.52","was getting the glory they were all "],["1079.84","worshiping God in that time they were "],["1082.679","all worshiping God and this time the "],["1086.2","word comes out and everyone heard it was "],["1089.32","Saul who won two weeks ago I asked "],["1093","brother Jim if he would get up here and "],["1094.88","share his praise about the healing that "],["1096.84","God gave him and uh time and time again "],["1099.2","we see answers of prayer around here and "],["1101.12","it's good that we take time to uh give "],["1102.96","the stories when we get on the other "],["1105.039","side and we're we're not surprised Paige "],["1107.159","had a good uh uh surgery all went well "],["1109.4","and we're going to be celebrating when "],["1110.919","she's totally healed that doesn't "],["1112.159","surprise us because we got a God who "],["1113.48","does heal we believe in healing and we "],["1115.64","do believe in God answering prayer but "],["1118.52","uh as when Jim got up and he gave his "],["1120.48","testimony he told one of the details he "],["1123.24","told was that you know I come to the "],["1124.64","Elders of the church and they anointed "],["1126.36","me with oil and they prayed for me and "],["1128.039","the church prayed for him and uh when he "],["1130.72","told the story he didn't say uh the "],["1134.24","elders healed me he didn't say prayer "],["1137.72","healed me he "],["1139.84","said God healed me right God brought the "],["1144.48","healing do you get what I'm driving at "],["1147.28","the glory and the praise always goes to "],["1150.96","always goes to God he's the one that "],["1152.84","gives us the victory he's the one who "],["1155.159","gives us the strength he's the one who "],["1157.64","pours out the blessings therefore he's "],["1159.96","the one who deserves all the praise I "],["1162.799","learned a long time ago that it's not "],["1165.24","about me and what I can do and what I "],["1167.799","can accomplish actually I learned that "],["1169.76","that's a recipe for disaster to be "],["1172.32","trusting in what Rob has the ability to "],["1174.96","do but if I'm trusting in the Lord if "],["1176.96","I'm obeying his word and he's helping me "],["1179.28","overcome he's bringing the victory then "],["1181.64","I give credit amen where credit is do "],["1185.36","you're going to see why that's important "],["1187.799","when we go to verse number five and "],["1189.6","seven so let's break a little bit of "],["1191","fresh ground here this morning it says "],["1192.559","in verse 5 the Philistines assembl okay "],["1195.039","we won the battle and everyone heard "],["1196.36","about it woohoo the Philistines "],["1198.2","assembled "],["1199.28","to fight with "],["1202.36","Israel 30,000 chariots 6,000 "],["1207.919","horsen and how many "],["1211.96","people as the sand of "],["1215.039","the the sand of the sea and they came up "],["1219.32","and camped at mishmash east of Beth "],["1221.08","Haven where the men of Israel saw this "],["1223.96","that they were in a straight people were "],["1225.799","hard pressed the people hid themselves "],["1228","in the caves the thickets and the cliffs "],["1229.64","and the sellers and the pits and some of "],["1233.12","the Hebrews crossed the Jordan into the "],["1234.64","land of GAD and Gilead but as for Saul "],["1236.84","he was a gilgal and all the people "],["1238.96","followed him "],["1241.88","trembling all "],["1243.799","right this is why you've got to trust in "],["1247.84","the "],["1248.679","Lord because once the Philistine Army "],["1251.72","shows up in full "],["1253.48","force all that bravado stops yeah yeah "],["1259.72","Saul's a warrior and we got an army now "],["1264.24","and we're going to teach those "],["1265.76","Philistines a lesson and oh my look at "],["1270.679","all the "],["1272","Philistines chariots how many they got "],["1275.6","two three four "],["1278.559","30,000 and how many "],["1280.84","soldiers we can't even count them "],["1283.72","it's like the sand of the "],["1286.76","sea remember uh couple weeks ago when we "],["1289.64","were talking about uh cisar in the Book "],["1293.36","of Judges and how cicar was terrorizing "],["1295.44","the land of Israel with his chariots "],["1297.84","remember how many chariots he had he had "],["1301.76","900 chariots and he was running all over "],["1304.84","everybody's land and run over "],["1306.159","everybody's farm and they couldn't do "],["1307.48","anything about him and it took a miracle "],["1309.76","of God to deal with 900 "],["1314.4","chariots how big of a problem is this "],["1316.84","one 30 "],["1319.52",",000 "],["1321.36","chariots that's a "],["1323.279","problem yeah well they know all that but "],["1326.12","so what because we've got Saul and "],["1330.159","Saul's awesome because he's really "],["1334.44","tall he's taller than all us yeah they "],["1337.279","got 30,000 chariots and and they got "],["1339.88","6,000 Horsemen and they got innumerable "],["1343.48","Army we got Saul and what else do we got "],["1347.4","I I told you this detailed before but "],["1348.84","flip over to verse 19 uh just a reminder "],["1352.6","interesting part of the the story "],["1356.279","here by the way there's no blacksmiths "],["1359.52","in Israel just so the author lets us "],["1362.44","know none in the land of Israel everyone "],["1364.279","has to go down to the Philistines if "],["1365.84","they want to get any iron work done it "],["1368.72","says why why was that well they they "],["1370.72","said we don't want them to have Spears "],["1372.12","or swords so you had to go to the "],["1374.36","Philistine territory to get any "],["1376.08","sharpening done of your your garden "],["1378.679","tools and they charged them a lot of "],["1380.96","money to sharpen their plows or their "],["1382.88","madlocks or their Forks or their axes uh "],["1385.96","and to fix their host so it came about "],["1388.799","the Day verse 22 it came about the day "],["1390.279","of battle that neither sword nor spear "],["1393.12","was found in the hands of any of the "],["1394.6","people who were with Saul or Jonathan "],["1396.88","but they were found with Saul and "],["1398.48","Jonathan so they got 30,000 chariots "],["1401.559","6,000 Horsemen Army is the sand of the "],["1405.159","Seas we got tall Saul "],["1410.4","and two "],["1412.44","swords and what "],["1414.76","else our garden "],["1417.08","tools right everybody went to the "],["1420.08","shed and got out their rakes and their "],["1423.96","leaf "],["1424.96","blowers they're weed "],["1427.799","whackers that's "],["1430.48","scary it's what they got right well they "],["1433.24","didn't have the leaf blowers but they "],["1434.6","had brakes "],["1436.799","and Ox go "],["1440","not a lot to work with there is it so "],["1442.4","the guys are like yeah what's their "],["1445.24","response when they see that we're in "],["1448.039","trouble right basically that's what they "],["1451.279","said in verse number six when it says "],["1452.88","they saw they were in a straight that "],["1454.919","means I'm they're besieged they're Bound "],["1457.039","in they're roped in they're in a bad bad "],["1460.039","position when they saw that what did "],["1461.679","they do verse number "],["1465.12","seven does it what' they do "],["1470.039","they took off didn't they right says "],["1471.96","they went to Gad and Gilead okay here's "],["1476.36","mishmash okay here's gilgal where "],["1479.24","everyone "],["1480.679","met it's very "],["1482.84","interesting you see that it says in the "],["1486.039","text that the Philistines showed up in "],["1487.44","mishmash and we learned last week that "],["1489.44","when they attacked GBA originally where "],["1491.84","was "],["1492.64","Saul he was at mishmash right so they "],["1495.679","attacked there and then the Philistines "],["1497.52","responded by "],["1499.559","right to where Saul was that's one of "],["1502","the uh problems when you try to take the "],["1503.6","credit you end up getting the credit "],["1505.799","right so you think you're the big man "],["1507.52","and then everyone showed up fortunately "],["1509.559","he said well let's back up here so we "],["1511.2","can get the troops together so "],["1512.44","everyone's supposed to meet a gilgal "],["1514.08","back here out of the way and uh get get "],["1516.679","our group our troops all settled so once "],["1519.24","they the the folks everyone gets there "],["1520.76","and they see the armies they go to "],["1524.2","Gilead and this is the area of Gilead "],["1526.279","jbes Gilead ralth Gilead this is Gilead "],["1529.2","and this is Gad so here's where the uh "],["1533.039","enemy is here's where they're supposed "],["1534.84","to be and here's where they went which "],["1537.64","way did they "],["1539.399","go they went away right they went the "],["1542.279","opposite direction of where the enemy "],["1546","is uh they looked at that crowd and they "],["1548.44","said yeah we're going to get out of "],["1550.12","Harm's "],["1552.279","Way all of Israel heard about Saul's "],["1557.24","success over the Philistines "],["1559.44","but you know what it's one thing to hear "],["1562.399","about beating the Philistines it's one "],["1565.159","thing to talk about yeah we got an army "],["1568.76","we got a king we're going to beat them "],["1570.6","it's one thing to talk about it but "],["1572.88","hearing and talking is not the same as "],["1576.96","actually doing "],["1579.559","it is "],["1581.279","it I think some of you might remember "],["1583.64","back in the summer Roberto was bringing "],["1585.96","a buddy of his to church as name was "],["1588.64","Miguel Miguel is 20-year-old young man "],["1591.32","he stood out cuz he was about 6'2 "],["1593.88","6'3 uh he loved playing basketball and "],["1596.52","him and Roberto had uh played a little "],["1598.44","bit of basketball against each other and "],["1600.24","he noticed surp he was somewhat "],["1602","surprised he noticed well Roberto you're "],["1603.84","not that bad at basketball he you know "],["1605.6","where did you learn how to play and "],["1607.08","Robbie told him well you know I've grown "],["1608.72","up playing basketball with my brothers "],["1611.039","and with my dad so he says to Miguel you "],["1613.96","should come over you like to play you "],["1615.2","should come over to our house and you "],["1616.72","can play basketball with with my dad and "],["1619.64","so sure enough one Sunday afternoon he "],["1621.44","came over after church and had we fed "],["1623.679","him which was a lot and then after we "],["1626.32","fed everyone we went out to play a "],["1627.799","little bit of Two on Two And then you "],["1630.2","know as we played for a little bit "],["1631.559","Miguel was somewhat impressed that the "],["1633.84","old fat short white guy wasn't all that "],["1637.76","bad now whenever you uh are Ed in my "],["1642.039","community and you dribble a basketball "],["1644.36","it's like uh all the it's like sonar "],["1646.64","that goes out and all the Young people "],["1648.48","live in the community can hear a "],["1650.08","basketball for three miles away and as "],["1652.159","soon as you dribble a ball inevitably "],["1654.799","people will start showing up like o I "],["1656.76","hear ball and they will start to show up "],["1658.76","on the street and sure enough we played "],["1660.24","for a little bit a couple of young guys "],["1662.32","were hanging out you know safe distance "],["1664.72","a few houses away watching you know the "],["1668.919","side of their eyes that us playing "],["1670.32","basketball and checking out the the "],["1672.159","talent that was out there the skill and "],["1675.44","uh after we played for a little bit uh I "],["1678.6","said to Miguel I think you know the "],["1680.919","neighbors want to play should we do that "],["1683.44","he's like yeah so I was like okay uh so "],["1686","I asked the young fellas you know would

Fells on the "],["1740.519","street and uh there's a big difference "],["1744.159","between saying you're going to kick my "],["1747.039","butt and actually being able to do "],["1751.36","it needless to say David on that "],["1754.48","afternoon this butt was not kicked so "],["1758.799","now I'm telling you all that to tell you "],["1760.36","this at church we do a lot of talking

"],["451.84","Israel in the days of King Saul so all "],["454.72","of this orange is what the tribes of "],["457.039","Israel owned and controlled this uh this "],["460.8","pink is uh other nations

to point the red light to "],["471.08","where we're talking but I'm going to try "],["472.24","to hold it steady okay it says that at "],["475.759","mishmash which is right here was Saul "],["478.759","and I give I right here was where "],["481.319","Jonathan was and it says that there was "],["483.919","a Garrison of of Philistines right here "],["488.199","at giba so there's mishmash here and "],["490.12","there's giia here so it's between the "],["491.68","two giba is a Garrison of Philistines "],["495.319","now when I point that out what is the "],["497.72","what's your observation about where "],["499.199","that's "],["500.4","at where is that is first of all you "],["503.199","notice that it's not in their territory "],["507.159","it's "],["508.039","where in

essence are cutting the "],["520.08","country in two they're dividing the "],["523.24","thing it's very hard to have unity in "],["526.12","your country when the enemy has got you "],["528.399","right up the middle and they have a "],["531","stronghold right in between the two is "],["533.8","it just me or does it seem that our "],["537.24","nation is cut in two "],["539.8","not literally or physically by an "],["541.8","invasion but "],["543.48","philosophically we are divided in our "],["547.36","beliefs aren't we time and time again on "],["551.12","every issue we see Division I started "],["554.32","with one this morning didn't I abortion "],["556.2","we are divided as a country on that one "],["558.399","and there's many more gay rights issues "],["560.72","the the role of

for I think it's good that "],["591.04","we're getting this history lessons from "],["592.839","Rob helping us understand our heritage "],["596.64","and and what we have lost we've lost our "],["598.64","identity we lost what is American "],["600.64","because we don't know our history and "],["603.24","when that video series comes out it's "],["604.72","going to come out on the internet in "],["606.44","about a month you'll want to get back in "],["608.44","there and have that that great research "],["610.48","that Rob has done but it seems like we "],["612.519","can't find anymore what to agree "],["615.44","on you know when Elana and I are having "],["618.6","disagreements my wife and I we "],["620.48","eventually can work them out because we "],["623.519","do have some values we can agree upon "],["627.48","usually it starts with with a cup of "],["630.36","coffee that coffee is our Olive Branch "],["633.88","where we've been fighting and uh you "],["636.519","know everyone has got stopped talking "],["638.48","and you know everybody stormed off to "],["639.8","their various Corners to calm down I "],["642.04","will uh I will go to her and I will say "],["646.36","you want some "],["650.16","coffee and as she says "],["653.44","yes then that means we're going to go "],["656.2","back to the table we're going to start "],["657.36","the process you know because coffee is "],["659.72","something that Rob and Iana both agree "],["661.6","upon we both like coffee you know and "],["663.639","you find something that you can start "],["666.519","repairing the discussions and repairing "],["669.12","the communication so that happens to be "],["671.839","what it is but we we like we have more "],["674.079","in common than just coffee we have all "],["676.56","kinds of uh values and and Views that we "],["679.519","agree upon we just got to start finding "],["682.24","them again and talking about them and uh "],["685.36","then we can find we can get on the same "],["688.36","page and and get on the same side if we "],["690.68","could just start somewhere so coffee is "],["693.92","a good place to start maybe you want to "],["695.839","try that sometime if you need someplace "],["698.12","find something you both like and you can "],["699.839","start there but uh it doesn't take us "],["703.44","long once we get started to see each "],["705.68","other's side "],["708.36","furthermore furthermore we know our "],["711.36","enemy "],["712.639","strategy we are keenly aware that the "],["715.639","devil seeks to seow Discord and what the "],["719.959","devil is always trying to do is use this "],["723.12","strategy of divide and conquer to divide "],["728.24","and conquer so we acknowledge that part "],["730.88","of the energy part of the energy in any "],["733.32","of our fights in any of our division is "],["736","that there's a spiritual battle going on "],["738.519","and that the devil wants us to be at "],["741.44","odds and because we know this neither "],["744.279","one of us like to play into his hand we "],["746.639","don't like to fall for his lies so we "],["749.24","call them out when we see them happening "],["751.959","we affirm what the Bible says that our "],["754.839","Lord wants us to have Unity that our "],["757.399","heavenly father asks us to be ask us to "],["760.079","be United and not divided that he wants "],["762.68","us to prefer one another and to serve "],["766.079","one another so that Spirit takes over us "],["769.44","and we're not trying to get our way "],["771.44","anymore we're now trying to Aid and "],["773.839","assist the other person and meet their "],["776.44","needs I'm not saying what's my way or "],["778.56","what I want I'm saying what does Iana "],["780.88","need what does she want and likewise she "],["782.88","says well how can I make this work for "],["785.48","Rob and now we're pulling together we're "],["788.839","now uniting if you're experiencing dear "],["792.16","folks some division in your home or some "],["794.92","division in your ministry don't dig your "],["797.56","heels in step back and look at the big "],["800.68","picture see who the enemy really is "],["804.279","because it's not your wife or your "],["806.44","husband who's the enemy it's not your

make decisions in accordance "],["830.72","with what he has told you to "],["834.32","do our beliefs "],["837.399","impact our decisions and our decisions "],["841.68","illustrate our beliefs one other "],["844.279","observation I want to make about the map "],["846.48","and division before we move on because "],["849.279","as I threw this up here to talk about "],["851.12","this this really jumped out at me and uh "],["854.519","I wanted I wanted to show it to you once "],["856.44","again the orange area is all the land "],["861.399","that Israel is there you go you're with "],["864.04","me Israel owned okay and this is where "],["867.48","the problem is is right in the of the "],["869","country now I know you can't read the "],["870.44","text but what's very conspicuous to me "],["873.519","is how this right in here juts right in "],["877.16","to the middle of the country and no "],["878.959","other place do you really see how deep "],["880.88","and sharp of a a control and you know "],["883.68","what's right here at the very edge of "],["885.399","this where they don't control where the "],["887.44","enemy controls and Israel doesn't "],["889","control you know what this little part "],["890.6","right there is it's the city of "],["893.68","Jerusalem that is right where this thing "],["896.279","Cuts right in and where Israel does not "],["898.72","not have control is Jerusalem doesn't "],["902.519","that seem a teeny bit conspicuous to "],["904.72","anybody is that just me or does anybody "],["906.36","get that right that of all these borders "],["909.44","the one area that cuts right in is to "],["912.12","that place where the city of Jerusalem "],["914.399","is Jerusalem wasn't controlled by Israel "],["917.48","until King David took it over and I knew "],["920.16","that but when I was looking at the map "],["922.24","this week it becomes so painfully aware "],["924.48","of what's going on what's going on here "],["926.72","Jerusalem we know is a holy sight it's a "],["930.8","piece of real estate that God has very "],["933.24","specific plans and purposes he has he "],["936.079","has prophecies he's got stated promises "],["939.519","that he's made for Israel things that "],["941.88","are going to happen in the city of "],["944","Jerusalem those plans and purposes those "],["946.36","promises that God has made the devil "],["948.839","wants to thwart consequently whenever "],["952.24","the devil can he tries to get Jerusalem "],["955.319","out of Israel's control and in somebody "],["957.72","else's "],["959.36","control it's true way back then is it "],["963","true today still going on today right "],["965.72","did you know that the Jerusalem it's "],["967.72","debatable on on which because Israel "],["970.199","would say that's our capital in our own "],["972.16","country our own president will not "],["973.72","affirm that Jerusalem is the capital of "],["976.639","Israel the same issues the same debates "],["978.959","are going on today you want to talk "],["981.44","about a divisive issue you just ask "],["983.6","people who does Jerusalem belong to "],["986.319","because all of the Muslims think it "],["987.88","belongs to Islam and all the Catholics "],["990.92","they want access to Jerusalem as well "],["993.519","the Jews want control of Jerusalem and "],["996","US

"],["1004.519","supposed to have control of it so we "],["1006.56","more or less would side with them but my "],["1008.639","point is is the same things that are "],["1011.24","going on 3,000 years

"],["259.919","chapter seven the Philistines tried it "],["261.479","at Mitzvah and then recently when we did "],["263.639","chapter 11 we saw the same strategy at "],["266.22","jabash Gilead to

"],["289.08","the right strategy it was a good idea "],["291.54","and they probably would have succeeded "],["293.1","it's just that God turned the tables and "],["296.16","since he had all of

because "],["308.82","they wiped out all of the ammonites and "],["311.639","they swept them all away and they're "],["312.9","having a big party uh Samuel stands up "],["315.36","to give this speech and we noted that he "],["318.12","starts by giving a history lesson and I "],["320.88","mean some of you like history lessons "],["322.139","particularly Rob blazik he likes history "],["324.06","lessons and he started talking about uh "],["327.18","some of the past oppressors in verse "],["329.94","number nine he said you you forgot the "],["332.88","Lord your God and he sold them you into "],["335.46","the hands of Cicero so even we talked "],["337.919","about the Jewish sin cycle last week how "],["339.66","they would Rebel and then God would "],["341.4","punish them and and they would be "],["343.02","oppressed and then God would deliver "],["344.4","them and then they would be blessed "],["346.38","again so that's what he's talking about "],["347.699","and he sold you into the hands of Cicero "],["350.759","Captain the armies of hazor and then "],["352.38","into the hands of the Philistines and in "],["354","the hands of Moab time and time again "],["355.8","that was the cycle uh of these people "],["358.5","oppressing them what's interesting about "],["361.139","Cicero who he names specifically is "],["363.9","sister ahead 900 chariots it tells us in "],["367.68","the Book of Judges and with his 900 "],["369.72","chariots him and his army would "],["372","terrorize all of the nation of Israel "],["374.1","they'd ride around with their chariots "],["376.139","and they run all over everybody and you "],["378","really couldn't stop them because they "],["379.8","had this great Calvary that they "],["381.6","attacked with but like Samuel said when "],["385.44","the people Cried Out verse number 10 "],["387.96","he said you cried out to the Lord "],["390.66","we have sinned because we've forsaken "],["393.12","the Lord and

"],["402.66","the judges who delivered Israel "],["405.9","remember who they were Barack and "],["410.1","ladies I expect you to get this one now "],["412.199","Deborah that's right Deborah the the the "],["414.78","female judge there the prophet is "],["416.819","Deborah and uh he used them Deborah told "],["420.18","Barack in Judges chapter 4 verse 7 he "],["424.02","said the the Lord has said

and in verse number 15 of Judges "],["444.66","chapter 4 it said at barack's Advance "],["447.479","the Lord routed Cicero in all of his "],["450.06","chariots and his army at the edge of the "],["451.979","sword before barack's Cicero alighted or "],["454.38","he jumped off his Chariot and he fled "],["456.78","away on foot why would you jump off your "],["460.979","chariot and run away on foot which is "],["464.88","faster "],["465.78","and I want to see if you can get this "],["466.979","question right because first service it "],["468.24","stunned them and I don't know what was "],["469.56","going on there but which is faster Chris "],["471.599","maybe you'll be good at this you running "],["473.28","with your ankle or you riding on a "],["476.22","chariot drawn by a horse which is faster "],["478.68","you say that you no no Chris not you The "],["481.74","Chariot right because the horse runs "],["483.9","faster than we do right so why would you "],["486.36","jump off the chariot "],["488.819","unless "],["490.5","something has happened that has "],["492.86","incapacitated your chariots "],["496.08","interesting in chapter five when Deborah "],["498.06","is doing her celebration and she's "],["499.62","writing her Psalm of praise to God she "],["501.9","gave us the detail of how we know what "],["505.5","happened and it says in Judges chapter 5 "],["507.539","21 the river kishan swept them away the "],["512.159","age-old river the river kishaw and March "],["514.26","on my soul be strong the torrents swept "],["517.919","them away God used the river to "],["521.52","sweep the Chariots away and then Barack "],["524.219","was on the mop-up duty to chase them "],["526.08","down to hunt them but once again the "],["527.94","strategy of the

that the "],["542.04","Lord uses in the end times "],["544.38","in Zechariah Chapter 14 1-4 it says the "],["548.1","day of the Lord is coming Jerusalem when "],["550.62","your possessions will be

"],["756.42","for curiosity's sake because Samuel "],["759.24","warns us in chapter 12 verses 24 to 25 "],["764.06","only fear the lord "],["766.86","serve him in truth with all your hearts "],["770.579","for consider what great things he's done "],["773.16","for you "],["774.36","but if you still do wickedly both you "],["777.72","and your king will be "],["781.26","wept away "],["784.38","see no longer is it something that can "],["787.139","just happen to Israel's enemies "],["790.32","it's something that can potentially "],["792.86","happen to them as well "],["795.42","here in chapter 12 we have one another "],["797.76","one of these fantastic if then "],["800.76","statements the if then statements are "],["803.279","what conditional covenants if you

the things observed about the "],["863.579","nation of Israel in scripture is that "],["866.04","they were responsible for what their "],["868.86","kings and their leaders did "],["873.72","I think that's appropriate what Kevin "],["875.519","was sharing with us earlier about Dr Ben "],["877.86","Carson it was good to go down here and "],["879.839","hear him and we need to pray that we can "],["882.42","get leaders who know God's word and fear "],["885.72","God's word because we're responsible for "],["889.44","the leaders in what they do the the "],["892.32","thing the thing that

notice and everyone responded and "],["905.579","they had a 330 "],["907.62","000 man army and they won the battle and "],["910.44","everything was good but the weakness of "],["912.839","that system is we have what a single "],["916.5","point of failure "],["918.12","if the king fears God and serves him in "],["921.18","truth we have no problems but if the "],["923.699","king is wicked and Rebels then "],["926.579","we're all "],["928.44","going with them "],["930.12","we're all Following the Leader you're "],["932.699","herded you're heaped together and "],["936.06","painted with the same

"],["949.56","Lord judged the nation everyone everyone "],["952.68","took the hit "],["954.839","we're entering a new era now in Samuel "],["957.24","chapter 12. it's it's the now age of the "],["959.699","kings in the Old Testament and Samuel "],["962.339","prophesies if you do wickedly both you "],["965.459","and your king "],["967.92","if you do you will be swept away did "],["971.22","that happen "],["974.279","the 10 Northern tribes did that happen "],["976.5","to them the Assyrian Empire came in and "],["979.019","what wipe them all away they never

though it is "],["1003.98","spoken to Israel still applies to our "],["1007.699","nation today if we fear the lord and if "],["1010.94","we serve him in truth and we do not "],["1012.98","Rebel then

tomorrow "],["61.239","by the time the Sun is hot you will have "],["65.64","Deliverance so The Messengers went and "],["68.6","told the men of jabes and they were of "],["71.6","course glad weren't they they were glad "],["74.24","that they were got some help coming "],["75.799","their way to help them in their time of "],["77.479","Crisis then the men of jabes turn around "],["80.52","and they go out to Nesh they go to the "],["82.479","ammonites and they say tomorrow we're "],["84.479","going to come out to you and you may do "],["86.92","to us whatever seems good to to you so "],["92.2","the next morning Saul put the people in "],["94.92","three companies and they came into the "],["96.84","midst of the camp at the morning watch "],["99.84","and struck down the ammonites until the "],["102.36","heat of the day those who were survived "],["104.799","were scattered so that no two men were "],["107.96","left together then the people said to "],["111.6","Samuel after the battle and all the "],["113.119","fighting's over they said who is he who "],["115.6","said shall Saul reign over us bring the "],["118.439","men that they may we may put them to "],["121.079","death but Saul said not a man shall be "],["124","put to death this day for today the Lord "],["127.84","has accomplished Deliverance in Israel "],["130.8","then Samuel said to the people come let "],["132.56","us go to gilgal and renew the kingdom "],["134.68","there so all the people went to gilgal "],["137.44","and there they made Saul King before the "],["139.599","Lord in gilgal there they also offered "],["142.64","sacrifices and peace offerings before "],["145.16","the Lord and there Saul and all the men "],["147.76","of Israel greatly "],["151.08","rejoiced greatly rejoiced first thing we "],["154.239","observe that is "],["155.8","great is the great number that responded "],["159.84","to the Call to Arms from The Book of "],["163.4","Genesis all the way to Second Kings if "],["166.4","you read through there and look at the "],["167.8","sizes of the armies you'll discover that "],["170.04","this is the second largest army Israel "],["173.56","ever had in those books from Genesis to "],["176.76","2 Kings we learn when we come to uh 1 "],["179.159","chonicles that King David took a census "],["182.4","to find out how big his army was and uh "],["185.239","he had a much larger Army than this one "],["187.92","here today but the Lord punished him for "],["192.239","taking that census and counting up his "],["194.36","army David did that so that he could be "],["197.2","impressed with the size and the might of "],["200.519","his army it wasn't an act that was "],["202.84","bringing glory to God and that act cost "],["205.68","him dearly why because God doesn't want "],["209.159","us to have "],["210.2","other gods before him and many times the "],["213.799","other gods we have before God is our own "],["216.799","pride and being impressed with our "],["219.879","greatness that can cause us a lot of "],["222.4","problems but this Army that Saul has uh "],["225.599","has led is leading today is worthy to "],["228.519","note the size because it was an act of "],["231.2","God that brought them together it was a "],["234.04","miracle that they could raise this size "],["236.319","of an Army in how much time less than a "],["239.48","week right less than a week and it's "],["241.4","because the fear of the Lord had brought "],["243.879","the people together so the size of this "],["246.239","Army is as the text says "],["248.36","330,000 soldiers how big is that "],["251.72","exactly well if that was an Army in "],["254.959","2013 that would be the 14th largest "],["257.759","military in the world today how about "],["260.44","that even though today we have billions "],["262.84","of people on the planet this size Army "],["265.28","right here would still be in the top 20 "],["267.88","of all the armies on the nation "],["270.039","incidentally this Army is five times "],["272.56","larger than the Canadian Army how about "],["275.919","that so they could go in there and take "],["277.199","over the great white North that's not "],["279.84","all that impressive to do but numbers "],["281.96","are a tricky thing it's easy to get "],["286.36","impressed with numbers isn't it to "],["288.84","assume that size equals greatness we "],["293.4","never want to make the mistake of doing "],["296.6","that we can be thankful for prosperity "],["299.88","and we can be thankful for abundance but "],["302.919","we never ought to assume that size "],["306.24","equals greatness I'll tell you what "],["308.52","equals "],["309.919","greatness God equals "],["313.039","greatness we never want to forget that "],["315.639","God equals greatness yes we have been "],["319.039","blessed at Faith Bible Church and we "],["321","have gained folks and we have gained "],["323.6","finances and every week when you look in "],["325.72","the bulletin you can see oh wow that's "],["327.44","what we need and this is what we brought "],["328.8","in and it's always a a blessing and we "],["331.12","always thank God that we have grown in "],["332.759","these areas and we are going to build a "],["335.08","larger facility to accommodate our "],["337.28","growth but just because we're growing "],["339.56","bigger doesn't mean that we're better or "],["343.039","our ministry is better or that Pastor "],["345.72","Rob is special or that he's doing a "],["348.24","great job I'll be quite honest with you "],["350.84","I'm not really doing that great of a job "],["353.919","I'd say it's somewhat mediocre and "],["355.919","sometimes I'm doing a downright pitiful "],["357.88","job sometimes people leave our church "],["361.759","hurt because I dropped the ball or I did "],["365.319","not lead them well enough to help them "],["368.52","that's a shame but it happens that's not "],["371.759","a good job the only thing great around "],["376.68","here is the god that we're serving the "],["380.039","only thing great about this church is "],["383.72","the head who is who's the head of the

not because of anything we're "],["410.08","doing is all that impressive or Eric "],["412.479","Brown singing is all that impressive or "],["414.759","the nursery is all that impressive or "],["416.44","the building's all that impressive no "],["417.8","we're here because we have a great God "],["420.479","who is worthy to be praised worthy to be "],["423.44","worshiped and worthy to be listened to "],["428.08","in 1 Samuel chapter 11 size of the army "],["432.4","indicates that a great God has brought "],["435.599","people together the next thing that's "],["438","great was the strategy that the spirit "],["440.96","of the Lord inspired Saul to use in "],["443.919","verse number nine uh The Messengers go "],["446.44","back to Jes Gilead with the uh with the "],["449.52","announcement that uh by the time the Sun "],["452.52","is hot you will have deliverance and the "],["454.84","men at J bash they're very glad and they "],["457.52","they they go out and then tell the folks "],["459.84","that tomorrow we will come out to you "],["462.56","and you will do to us whatever seems "],["464.479","good to you but then Saul and the people "],["467.319","uh are divided into three companies they "],["469.4","show up in the midst of the camp and the "],["471.199","morning watch struck the ammonites Down "],["472.96","In the Heat of the day and they who "],["476.199","survived were scattered so that no two "],["478.879","were left left behind we know we know "],["481.36","that Jes Gilead had how many days to "],["484.4","answer "],["485.72","Nesh seven days they said you know give "],["488.159","us seven days to see if we can get some "],["489.919","help and if you don't we don't get any "],["492.479","help then we will come out to you and "],["495.4","you could do to us whatever you please "],["498.56","that's what was said in verse number "],["499.879","three if none come to deliver us we will "],["502.319","give ourselves up to you and that's what "],["504.639","it sounds like they're saying in verse "],["505.96","number 10 doesn't it they said tomorrow "],["507.84","we're going to come out and you could do "],["510","whatever seems good they didn't tell "],["512.36","thees hey guess what NES we got some "],["515.32","help coming so stick that in your pipe "],["518.159","and smoke it we're gonna we're g to whip "],["520.2","you in the morning no they didn't commun "],["522.68","they communicated the opposite we're "],["524.08","going to surrender you can do what you "],["526.04","want so what does that do for "],["529.48","NES what do the ammonites think they "],["532.76","think "],["533.76","heyy they're surrendering we got them "],["536.8","beat no help is coming and we can do "],["539.32","what now we can we can celebrate right "],["542.16","we can relax we can start taking it easy "],["545.519","but in reality help is on the way they "],["550.68","gathered at BAC approximately 10 miles "],["554.68","away from JB best Gilead and that would "],["557.24","take them all you military people who "],["559.16","have marched how long would that take "],["560.56","you to March 10 miles roughly four hours "],["563.6","you'd say give or take okay four hours "],["565.6","yeah maybe a little faster some people "],["566.92","slower it's 330,000 people hey so might "],["569.519","take about four hours to get there they "],["572.72","broke up into three companies and they "],["574.24","made it to J bash by the morning "],["577.04","watch which would be between 2 and 6: "],["581.6","p.m. that would have been the morning "],["582.88","watch between 2: to 6 that's a great "],["585.24","time to attack because most people are "],["588.079","doing what between 2 and six most people "],["591.279","are sleeping some of you get up at four "],["592.88","or five to go to work but most people "],["594.88","try to sleep at that time that's a great "],["597.279","time to attack and uh if they they "],["599.279","assumed that jbes was surrendering in "],["601.32","the morning anyways they may not have "],["603.16","been standing too sharp on guard so if "],["606.24","your Army's asleep and then all of a "],["608.24","sudden you wake up and you're being "],["610.279","overrun by 330,000 soldiers that you "],["613.72","didn't even know existed how do you "],["615.959","think that fight "],["618.04","went the text says no two were left "],["623.6","together what does that mean no two were "],["626.36","left together that's an interesting "],["628.56","detail it means they were completely "],["631.16","routed there's absolutely no rally no "],["635.839","defense you you have to have at least a "],["638.32","couple of guys pulled together in order "],["640.079","to mount some sort of Defense don't you "],["642.839","Rick plays defense for me down at KCA on "],["645.16","the soccer team and uh when we're in "],["647.36","practice we do a lot of six on four "],["650.68","drills a lot of six offense against four "],["653.92","Defenders and you're thinking well "],["654.959","that's not really fair six on four that "],["656.76","means they got more guys and and they're "],["658.76","going to score all the time because "],["660.48","they're outnumbered but that doesn't "],["662.2","happen does it rick because you're so "],["664.12","awesome right yeah no actually it's much "],["668.04","easier to defend than it is to attack "],["671.839","and score and what happens in a six on "],["674.36","four plus Alex molie is that uh the uh "],["678.04","the defense will come back and tighten "],["680.12","up and contain and and they'll keep the "],["682.399","ball out there so they can't get shots "],["684.12","and then they'll cover each other's back "],["685.639","and kind of work as a little unit to "],["687.68","prevent shots from taking place so if "],["690.639","you can get a couple of guys backto back "],["693.639","holding the right piece of terrain they "],["695.959","can be very effective can't they you "],["698","don't need a lot to form a defense and "],["700.399","and and mount some sort of comeback sort "],["702.16","of like you remember the story of King "],["703.519","leonitis in the 300 right they held that "],["706.12","pass against the entire Persian army "],["709.48","because they were a few committed guys "],["711.399","on the right piece of terrain and they "],["713.32","were able to hold out for a long time "],["715.92","now you remember this is the entire "],["718.16","ammonite Army trained and organized came "],["721.68","out against jaes on the offensive they "],["724.16","chosen the Battleground they've been set "],["726.04","up in their Camp all of the nation of "],["728.04","Israel is coming to them so they're kind "],["730","of already dug in surely they would have "],["732.839","had some plans surely they could get "],["735.079","reorganized regroup and put up some sort "],["737.32","of a fight and the answer is nope they "],["740.72","are completely beat down so demolished "],["744.24","they can't even put two guys back to "],["747.279","back it says they were "],["750.72","scattered scattered what does that look "],["752.92","like that's running away in all "],["755.519","directions running for your life well "],["759.04","isn't that exciting for the "],["762.32","Israelites "],["763.92","but so what what does that have to do "],["768.6","with me sitting in the Pew here today in "],["771.24","2013 I mean really what am I supposed to "],["773.36","do with that I'm not going to battle "],["775.279","nobody's surrounding me well I want to "],["778.92","let you to know that we too have a great "],["782.72","strategy given to us in the word of God "],["786","that was inspired by the holy spirit in "],["788.12","James chter 4 verse 7 and 8 the author "],["792.12","tells us to submit to God resist the "],["796.56","devil and the devil will what flee he "],["800.12","will scatter from us draw nigh to God "],["806","and He will draw near to you draw near "],["809.44","to God and He will draw near to you "],["812.48","Israel had a great Army because they had "],["816.279","a great God Israel had a great strategy "],["819.56","because it was God's strategy our God is "],["823.24","a great God and if you draw near to him "],["827.44","you would be on his side dear folks if "],["830.199","you would join his army you would be "],["832.199","fighting alongside of him and his power "],["835.72","and in his might it's great to have the "],["839.839","strongest person on your side or to be "],["842.839","on his side back when I was in high "],["845.079","school my best friend Kevin was the "],["847.8","biggest dude in the school his family "],["851.48","they were all Farmers uh to begin with "],["854.12","so he came from some pretty stocky bunch "],["856.16","of guys but

"],["1018.88","greatness in Saul a great leader here "],["1021.88","look at what his reaction is to what "],["1023.88","happens next you'll remember when Saul "],["1027.52","was first crowned to be

we talked about having too much "],["1039.199","baggage and many times we're hiding in "],["1041.12","our baggage and how Saul was hiding "],["1043.039","because he didn't want the job and he "],["1044.4","was kind of scared so he wasn't really "],["1046.36","an impressive fiery King at that moment "],["1049.36","was he but they crowned him many ways "],["1051.28","and Samuel said behold God's choice uh "],["1054.919","who is better than this guy right here "],["1056.76","and we stress the fact that God chose "],["1058.52","the king and and some people were like "],["1060.679","YooHoo

"],["96.68","out Messengers throughout the territory "],["98.28","of "],["99.479","Israel and see if no one comes to "],["102.119","deliver us we will come out to you the "],["105.24","messengers went to gibba of Saul and "],["108.439","spoke these words to in the hearing of "],["110.68","the people and all the people lifted up "],["113.2","their voices and wept Now Behold Saul "],["116.96","was coming from the field behind The "],["118.399","Oxen and said what is the matter with "],["120.759","the people that they weep so they "],["122.92","related to him the words of the men of "],["124.92","Ja men of "],["126.88","jabes then the spirit of the Lord Came "],["129.8","Upon Saul mightily when he heard these "],["132.08","words and he became very angry he took "],["136.239","an ox uh a Yol of an ox and cut them "],["139.56","into pieces sent them through the "],["141.72","territory of Israel by the hand of the "],["144.04","messenger saying whoever does not come "],["146.48","out after Saul and after Samuel so shall "],["149.959","it be done to his "],["151.72","oxen then the dread of the Lord fell on "],["154.879","the people and they came out as one "],["159.959","man okay the question that I was asked "],["162.519","to me last week by two different people "],["165","from last week's message was Pastor Rob "],["168","why did the ammonites let these "],["170.68","Messengers go out why did he let them go "],["173.44","out and uh find some help try to get "],["175.76","some Deliverance uh makes sense right "],["177.959","they had the city besieged and they had "],["180.36","them you know dead to rights and they "],["181.92","still let them go try to find someone "],["184.4","and that was a very good Bible student "],["186.72","question to ask I had asked myself that "],["189.44","same question last week when I was doing "],["191.159","my studies but by the time I got through "],["193.4","all the questions the other questions I "],["194.879","was looking up I didn't have time to "],["197.239","address that one that's really kind of "],["199.28","how I build a message I just kind of uh "],["201.72","read the passage and then I ask leading "],["203.4","questions you know who are these "],["204.4","ammonites and where did they come from "],["206.04","and why are they attacking Israel and "],["207.519","why is always someone attacking Israel I "],["210.239","answer the questions I discover the "],["211.799","biblical principles I illustrate and "],["213.36","apply them to us and there you go that's "],["215.4","the message so now you know the formula "],["218.319","you can uh apply for the "],["220.799","job so a great question why did the "],["223.599","ammonites give J bash gillad seven days "],["227.48","to find a deliverer why did they even "],["229.72","let the messengers go I think the answer "],["232.76","to that question ties into with what "],["235.4","Nesh said to J to the people of jabes in "],["239","verse number two "],["240.36","he said what I will give you this uh "],["243.159","Covenant I'll make this with you on one "],["245.239","condition that I get to gore out the "],["247.76","right eye of every one of you thus I "],["251.239","will make it a reproach "],["254.159","on "],["256.079","all Israel on all of Israel he's looking "],["262.24","for a fight with who all of Israel he "],["267.919","wants a war he's not afraid afid of "],["270.08","who's going to going to come to their "],["272.68","aid he wants them to come there's a "],["277","practical reason why he wants them to "],["279.16","come and I have to officially give "],["281.36","credit to brother Kevin fry who pointed "],["284.36","this observation out to me and I think "],["285.84","he made a good a good observation I "],["287.84","think it's right but also I will more "],["289.919","than just a practical uh illustration or "],["293","application I want to give you a "],["294.28","spiritual one as well but nahash wants "],["296.4","to fight with all of Israel so yes by "],["299.32","all means send out your Messengers see "],["302.52","who's going to come to deliver you the "],["305.08","only reason why you would do that is "],["307.4","that you don't believe whoever shows up "],["311.12","can "],["312.08","help you don't believe whoever shows up "],["314.4","will be able to deliver them he thinks "],["316.6","he can defeat anybody from this nation "],["319.8","and he wants to fight all of Israel "],["322.56","because that's going to make his life so "],["324.6","much easier what why would that make his "],["327.28","life easier to fight all of the nation "],["330.8","because if they all show up to him this "],["333.68","is the kingdom of

"],["354.08","to home closer to his supplies closer to "],["357.84","his territory and he doesn't have to go "],["360.56","around and besiege every walled City one "],["363.6","at a time that's a campaign that's going "],["365.199","to take a lot of time as opposed to them "],["367.4","all coming over here fighting him in the "],["369.599","open he thinks I can whip up on these

"],["210.72","to consider by way of an application to "],["213.04","that fact think about this for a minute "],["216.4","people are always thinking or saying and "],["219.799","maybe you thought or said this yourself "],["221.76","why doesn't God just tell me what he "],["223.84","wants me to do you ever said that why "],["226.92","isn't God just tell me who I'm supposed "],["229.64","to marry or tell me where I'm supposed "],["231.599","to school go to school or tell me what "],["233.48","job he wants me to do tell me what "],["235.439","Ministry he wants me to be serving in if

that thought that "],["246.04","yeah just tell me right think about this "],["247.72","for a moment though maybe God is "],["251.439","protecting you from a whole lot of "],["253.72","direct attacks from the Devil by not "],["256.12","telling you the specifics because if you "],["258.44","look at history and you look at the word "],["260.079","of God as soon as God says the specific "],["262.639","plan as soon as the specific plan is "],["264.639","known as soon as he makes a covenant "],["266.36","with someone all this intense attack and "],["269","persecution of the Devil Comes upon that "],["271.84","individual so maybe God doesn't clearly "],["274.479","tell you specifics about your life "],["276.12","because he's already knows he's already "],["277.4","got the plan he's already going to do it "],["278.8","irregardless of whether you like it or "],["280.28","not and he doesn't want to tip the enemy "],["283.72","off that' be smart wouldn't it right "],["286.16","Mike

"],["292.84","didn't do that did he Jason no called "],["294.639","them did you check right no they "],["296.479","wouldn't do that same's true with God he "],["299.08","keeps plan to himself that way the devil "],["301.6","really knows who to hit hard he's got "],["304.12","him off balance and always scrambling to "],["306.08","keep up with what God's doing if we knew "],["308.12","the plan then Satan would know the plan "],["310.759","and then he'd hit us that much harder "],["312.6","with all of his power I don't know about "],["314.639","you but I don't really want that in my "],["316.28","life right I mean I can look at the "],["318.24","Bible I can look at history and I can "],["319.68","look at Israel and soon as they learn "],["321.96","the plan the enemy attacked them the "],["324.52","enemy came "],["325.68","in you know and the other thing is with "],["327.639","Israel is they do the plan of God they "],["330.759","do have it in writing and do it really "],["332.759","help them they still don't get it do "],["335.44","they they're still struggling they have "],["337","it written right down in front of them "],["338.44","and they still can't add it all up and "],["340.56","make it work for their lives it hasn't "],["342","made their lives easier it has made it "],["344.28","harder so I think for us it's so much "],["348.08","easier if you don't know the specifics I "],["350.919","think it's just to know the big "],["352.28","principles and then "],["354.96","what then what trust right don't don't "],["359.639","worry trust believe and hope in the "],["363.199","promises that God has given us and not "],["365.72","sweat the specifics so that's a look at "],["368.52","the big picture the who is attacking "],["370.68","Israel this month you know it's the "],["373.08","flavor of the month there'll be someone "],["374.28","next month there'll always be somebody "],["375.44","else and why they're doing it that's the "],["377.24","big picture okay well let's zoom in now "],["379.88","and talk about the specifics of 1st "],["382.84","Samuel chapter 11 and let's meet the "],["385.919","ammonites particularly the king of Amon "],["388.72","who is "],["394.319","this proper name for the king of "],["398.44","madesh is one vowel away from the Hebrew "],["403.44","word for "],["404.96","serpent they sound almost the same

"],["437.36","people before you'll realize that it is "],["439.24","the devil at work the devil is on the "],["442.919","attack we know that the devil is always "],["444.72","on the attack because first Peter CH 5'8 "],["447.12","told us to what be sober to be alert "],["451.479","because what your adversary the devil "],["454.039","walks around like a roaring lion seeking "],["457.4","whom he

side "],["479.8","of the Jordan River close to the border "],["484.44","right on the border of the land of the "],["487.36","ammonites which makes sense why they got "],["489.759","attacked right naturally the guys on the "],["492.479","border are the first ones to get "],["496.4","attacked something to think about isn't "],["499","it when it comes to the devil and "],["503.479","sin some of

they are what's the text "],["629.839","say they are besieged that means what "],["633.839","means they're not kicking your door in "],["635.24","at that very moment they've just what "],["637.399","kind of parked all their armies around "],["639.079","you they've set up shop and uh everyone "],["642.959","who lives around Jes Gilead all the "],["644.76","people with their Farmland they uh they "],["647.56","did what when the um when the the the "],["650.16","the ammonites showed up they all ran to "],["652.32","the city they all got in and they all "],["654.92","bared the door shut to kind of keep them "],["656.76","out and that's okay that's going to work "],["658.76","for a little while closed up in there "],["662.04","and nightes have set up outside what's "],["664.16","going to "],["666.44","happen nothing what's gonna "],["669.36","happen Eric see you think with the belly "],["671.72","don't you Eric you know first thought "],["673.079","we're going to run out of Pepsi real "],["674.519","soon all right we you know fries are "],["677.04","going to run out there's going to be no "],["678.2","more cheeseburgers eventually we're "],["679.639","going to run out of food here and the "],["681.399","ammonites are just kind of waiting us "],["682.8","out so we got two options we can sit in "],["685.279","here and starve to death or we can go "],["688.44","out and conf front the enemy well they "],["690.2","look out over the wall they look at the "],["691.639","armies they look at who's in here and "],["693.04","they say yeah chances are we're going to "],["695.519","get whipped really bad so do we have "],["698.6","another option yes what's our other "],["701","option let's "],["703.12","negotiate Let's Make a Deal and they "],["706.2","said make a covenant with us and we will "],["709.48","serve you promise you will let us live "],["712.6","and we will give you what you want what "],["714.959","would that mean for the uh jbes Gilead "],["717.24","what would they have to give up well "],["718.48","typically that would "],["719.88","mean taxes right that would mean money "],["722.959","they would have to pay tribute to uh the "],["725.68","ammonite Kingdom uh they would basically "],["728.639","come under the ammonite "],["731.6","domain they would essentially be no "],["735.12","longer independent free

"],["1080.799","wasn't like random that was carefully "],["1083.679","inspected choice the question is not "],["1086","against saul the question is directed "],["1087.76","against the lord's choice

"],["210.64","1st Samuel 10 verse number 17 read a "],["214.84","little bit of what we did last week and "],["216.56","then we'll move on into the story Samuel "],["219.159","has called all the people together to "],["221.439","the Lord at mitzpah chapter 10:1 17 says "],["225.28","he said to the sons of Israel thus "],["227.84","sayith the Lord the god of Israel I "],["229.879","brought Israel up out of Egypt and I "],["232.159","delivered you from the hand of the "],["233.36","Egyptians from the power of the kingdoms "],["235.92","that were oppressing you but you have "],["238.959","today re rejected your God who delivered "],["241.799","you from all your calamities and your "],["243.319","distresses yet you said no set a king "],["245.92","over us now therefore present yourselves "],["248.28","before the Lord by the tribes and by "],["250.799","your Clans all right that was last week "],["253.04","we learned all that picking up verse "],["255.92","number 20 thus Samuel brought all the "],["257.799","tribes of Israel together near to The "],["259.359","Tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot and "],["261.799","then he brought the Tribe of Benjamin "],["263.4","near by its families and the Mite family "],["267.44","was taken and Saul the son of F was "],["270.039","taken but when they looked for him he "],["273.4","could not be "],["274.96","found therefore they inquired further of "],["277.28","the Lord has the man come yet so the "],["279.96","Lord said behold he hides himself "],["283.88","by the "],["285.96","baggage so they ran and took him there "],["288.68","and they stood him amongst the people he "],["290.759","was taller than any other people head "],["292.16","and shoulders and upward behold he was "],["295.84","hiding himself by the baggage Samuel "],["299.72","called all the people the nation to "],["301.08","mitzpah to give them the big "],["302.24","announcement that the Lord had decided "],["304.8","who was going to be king now Saul who "],["307.52","was chosen already knew he was chosen "],["310.32","because Samuel had pulled him aside a "],["312.039","couple days earlier and told him he was "],["314.039","anointed and anointed him and said "],["315.919","there's going to be three signs to prove "],["317.6","that this is going to happen and uh we "],["319.68","learned the three signs you remember "],["321.12","what the three signs were first of all "],["322.6","the donkeys were found meaning that God "],["324.52","was providing for his physical needs "],["326.36","providing for his UH responsibilities "],["329.039","second sign was that he was going to "],["330.639","receive from the sacrifice the people "],["332.479","coming from sacrifice the wine and the "],["334.759","bread and uh we that symbolizes the the "],["338.08","body and blood the broken uh body that "],["340.8","paid the sacrifice for sin of Jesus and "],["343.44","then he was going to the third sign was "],["345.52","Saul was going to be filled with the "],["347.6","Holy Spirit and he was going to prophesy "],["350.12","right and those signs interesting enough "],["352.039","are the same signs that we receive that "],["354.72","we know we are called by God to be his "],["357.12","servants he provides for us he sent his "],["360","son to be the sacrifice for our sin and "],["362.08","we trust in Jesus Christ in his broken "],["364.44","body and his shed blood he's paid he's "],["366.84","the propitiation for all of our sins "],["370.08","he's the "],["371.12","substitute and then thirdly when we "],["373.479","trust in Jesus we have faith in Jesus we "],["375.68","receive the filling of the holy spirit "],["378.599","so Saul knew that he was going to be "],["381.24","brought before the people as all this "],["383.28","whole thing of choosing The Tribe of "],["385.12","Benjamin and widowing the families down "],["387.68","he knew ultimately it was going to be "],["390.84","him that was going to be presented as "],["393.44","the king but Saul's not a real confident "],["397.12","guy and as the procedure gets down to "],["401.639","the tribe and then down to the "],["404.12","particular family and down to the family "],["406.479","of Kish she's getting more nervous and "],["408.72","more nervous and he's sneaking back to "],["412.759","hide the "],["416.68","baggage so apparently as Israelites are "],["421.039","a lot like Americans whenever they go "],["423.479","somewhere they need to take a whole "],["424.96","bunch of stuff with them don't they and "],["427.599","the same's true at mitzpah there was a "],["429.479","designated area with all the baggage and "],["432.16","that's where Saul sneaks away I don't "],["435.56","think Saul's the only person who does "],["438.639","that I think lots of people hide from "],["442.52","doing the will of God in their baggage "],["446.24","what am I "],["447.96","talking Hebrews CH 12 verse number one "],["451.599","says let us lay aside every weight and "],["455.84","every sin that easily besets us and let "],["459.44","us run with endurance the race that is "],["462.84","set before us my uh middle son Rick he "],["465","really likes to run track so every "],["467.199","spring we go over to the uh the sporting "],["469.879","goods store there and we buy him some "],["472.28","track shoes unlike uh basketball shoes "],["475.12","which are high tops which prevent your "],["476.52","ankles from Rolling or soccer shoes "],["479.56","which have those studs on the

they're very light "],["488.159","aren't they very light not much at all "],["490.639","to these shoes I remember when I was "],["492.96","young fell I didn't run track I was very "],["494.84","slow

"],["39.12","then it happened when he turned his back "],["41.12","to leave samuel god changed his heart "],["44.96","and all those signs came about on that "],["46.719","day of course that's what we've been "],["47.92","studying "],["48.879","saul being anointed by samuel "],["51.6","and then uh to be king "],["54","and then receiving three signs "],["57.039","to prove samuel said these signs are "],["59.52","proved to you that this word is from the "],["61.28","lord "],["62.399","and those signs took place and one of "],["64.64","those signs of course we're going to "],["65.92","look at specifically today in verse "],["67.52","number 10 says when they came to the "],["69.52","hill behold a group of prophets met him "],["71.84","the spirit of god came upon him mightily "],["74.159","so that he prophesied among them it came "],["77.28","about when all the people knew him "],["79.36","previously saw that he prophesied "],["82.08","now with the prophets the people said

please tell me "],["115.439","what samuel said to you so saul said to "],["117.439","his uncle well uh he told us plainly "],["119.759","that the donkeys had been found but he "],["122.159","did not tell them about the matter of "],["124.719","the kingdom which saul had "],["127.119","mentioned "],["129.28","all right so we see the sign of prophecy "],["131.599","coming true in saul's life uh "],["134.4","we we went out for some chinese food "],["136.48","this past week and "],["138.319","of course after a yummy meal we received "],["140.959","our complimentary fortune cookies

"],["456.479","and also wars and rumors of wars and "],["459.039","right smack in the middle of that is "],["460.4","that little prophetic country of israel "],["462.4","and that always makes us very aware and "],["464.88","you should be because these are signs of "],["467.52","the end times that's what saul has here "],["470.16","in verse "],["471.12","chapter 9 in chapter 10 he has a word

"],["512.64","not for the those who believe but those "],["514.64","who are unbelieving "],["516.32","but prophecies is a sign not for the "],["519.599","unbelieving but for those who "],["522.32","believe "],["524.399","that's what we've been reading today "],["526","prophecies from jesus prophecies about "],["528","the last days prophecies from the "],["529.519","apostle john

of "],["541.839","the signs given to saul to confirm that "],["543.519","he was going to be king is he was filled "],["545.44","with the spirit of the lord and he "],["547.44","prophesies "],["548.959","verse number 10 "],["551.36","when they came down the hill behold a "],["552.959","group of prophets met them the spirit of "],["554.8","the lord came upon him mightily so that

the son of kish "],["581.04","is saul now a prophet "],["583.6","the man there said now who's his father "],["586.399","therefore it became a proverb is saul "],["588.88","among the prophets "],["590.959","it's very interesting "],["592.72","because saul is not "],["595.04","nor has he ever been a prophet "],["597.839","all his life as far as everyone here is "],["600.08","concerned he's the "],["602.56","who sonic ish right which is not a bad "],["605.519","thing "],["606.32","kiss was a mighty man of valor we "],["608.48","learned he was a good warrior he was a

about this story "],["388.479","is that saul is just this dude out "],["390.8","looking for his father's lost donkeys "],["393.6","but along the way to finding the donkeys "],["395.919","he ends up being anointed the king of "],["399.199","israel as we learned already saw the "],["401.6","servants were having no luck finding "],["403.44","these donkeys and they decided to go ask

"],["413.759","but god had told samuel that saul was "],["416","coming uh to him and that where the "],["418.479","donkeys were and also told him that saul "],["420.96","was going to be the king of israel so "],["423.52","when saul arrived in town he goes to "],["425.199","talk to samuel about the lost donkeys "],["426.88","instead samuel "],["428.96","takes saul to this special banquet puts "],["431.759","him at the head of the table at the "],["434.08","place of honor it says in verse number "],["435.84","22 brought him into the hall "],["438.479","and gave him the place of the head of "],["440","those who were invited about 30 men and "],["442.4","he said to the cook bring the portion "],["445.52","that i gave you concerning which i told "],["447.52","you to set aside "],["449.12","and the cook took up the leg i don't "],["451.44","know what that leg was but i'm just "],["453.039","going to be big right it's a leg or "],["454.479","something like a "],["456.16","i don't know lay hammer "],["458.639","roast "],["460.319","big hunk of "],["461.44","big hunk of cow right that'd be keith "],["463.199","that'd be great just a big leg of cow "],["464.72","you'd like that should smoke that thing "],["466.56","up for us "],["467.599","that's what he brings him right this "],["468.88","great big leg of something and he puts "],["471.28","it before saul and samuel says "],["474.16","here is what has been reserved "],["478.479","set it before you and eat "],["480.319","it's been kept for you until the "],["483.039","appointed "],["484.319","time "],["485.68","it's been kept for you "],["487.52","until the appointed time "],["490","now let me just point out that perhaps "],["491.68","saul was a little bit confused and "],["493.52","overwhelmed and really didn't understand "],["495.039","what samuel was doing when he brought "],["496.8","him to the banquet and set him at the "],["498.24","head table the place of honor you know "],["500.639","maybe he didn't pick up on that subtle "],["502.72","yet relevant act but i'll tell you right "],["504.96","now he would have noticed something was "],["507.919","up when they dropped that big special "],["510.479","piece of meat in front of him when they "],["513.44","handed him that hunk of barbecued leg he "],["516.479","would have figured out "],["518.08","something's going on

you learn "],["532.08","that "],["532.959","that's dad's chair at the table "],["535.36","and the big piece of meat goes "],["539.44","to dad doesn't he right mom cooks up the "],["542","meal and she brings it we got steaks "],["543.839","brings them to put them on the table and "],["545.6","the all the boys eyes get big and "],["547.76","everybody's ready to jump in and right "],["549.76","before everybody can grab their piece "],["551.44","eliana says that piece right there "],["554.56","is for your father "],["556.72","right moms teach those lessons early on "],["559.6","and you know "],["561.279","that makes me feel really special "],["564.399","it's it's kind of silly i understand but "],["566.959","i find it honoring i find it respectful "],["569.92","you know we do a lot of sacrificing of "],["572.16","our time and our resources for our boys "],["574.16","we cater to their wants and we cater to "],["576.48","their needs and you know moms especially "],["578.8","or they'll sacrifice and emphasize doing "],["581.44","things for the children and and the kids "],["584","kind of get that idea that you know hey "],["585.92","life revolves around me "],["587.92","you know all these adults here they're "],["589.36","all here to serve my needs and wants "],["592.959","but in that simple act she puts everyone "],["595.76","in their place "],["597.36","that's your

"],["615.12","saul is going to understand they are "],["616.959","treating me special "],["618.959","something's happening here "],["621.519","you might be thinking well this is kind "],["622.64","of

a prophet the prophet would "],["898.88","receive messages from the Lord and then "],["900.88","deliver the messages to the people now "],["903.079","in my opinion Samuel has the best "],["905.959","prophetic gig in all of scripture You "],["908.44","can disagree with that that's just an "],["909.839","opinion but if you research it and do a "],["911.88","little uh bible study on it I think that "],["914.639","Samuel has the best gig because he hears "],["917.44","from God and the people actually listen "],["920.639","to Samuel and follow his instructions so "],["923.279","he can Implement what God is commanding "],["925.639","without too much hassle Moses and Joshua "],["929.92","and Samuel these guys were prophets and "],["933.199","they were the leaders of the nation so "],["936.399","once they heard from the Lord they could "],["938.399","for the most part get everyone to do "],["941.16","what God wanted now Samuel he was "],["943.759","actually a prophet and "],["947.399","a priest and a judge right he was all "],["952.36","three as a priest he would administer "],["955.16","the blessings like we see in our text "],["957.68","where he's going to bless the "],["959.36","food sometimes we get um we do the same "],["962.16","things don't we you know we're going to "],["963.24","have a fellowship downstairs we're going "],["964.8","to have some hot dogs

"],["987.079","because Rob is not the only guy around "],["988.8","here who can you know bless something so "],["991.759","praise God that we have a multiple of "],["993.48","servants who can bless our food these "],["995.6","guys are all sitting around waiting for "],["997.56","Samuel to show up uh so that's his his "],["1000.199","job as a as a as a priest be the "],["1002.839","advocate

change is going to be a problem "],["1027.319","why is it a problem because Saul does "],["1030.48","not hear directly from "],["1033.199","God God doesn't speak to him that way he "],["1036.24","speaks to Samuel now Samuel has to speak "],["1038","to Saul and then Saul has to tell "],["1039.079","everybody what to do but because he's "],["1040.559","not hearing from God he doesn't always "],["1042.12","know Samuel's not always there and then "],["1044.76","Saul will listen "],["1046.679","to the people "],["1049.12","right and then he'll listen to his own "],["1051.64","logic and we're going to learn that that "],["1054.32","gets you in hot water you can get in a "],["1057.12","lot of trouble listening to others don't "],["1059.28","listen to the wrong "],["1061.4","people or yourself you ever notice that "],["1064.16","that can get you into trouble anybody "],["1065.919","anyone yes thoughts of hand many times "],["1068.679","the people you ought to listen to who "],["1071.44","tell you what you need to hear we don't "],["1073.88","really pay attention to those people "],["1075.64","rather we find people who will tell us "],["1078.08","what we we desire to hear people who "],["1080.64","will agree with our desires and those "],["1083.96","are the people we want to listen to many "],["1087.64","times the Kings did that they did not "],["1090.44","hear from God and they did not want to "],["1092.32","hear from God they would God would send "],["1094.48","a prophet but they would ignore the "],["1096.36","prophet or they would persecute the "],["1097.96","prophet or they would kill the prophets "],["1101.2","Elijah for example Was Elijah a great "],["1103.72","prophet of the Lord oh man one of the "],["1105.799","most amazing one of the very best was he "],["1108.4","leader of the "],["1109.559","nation no he wasn't the leader and that "],["1112.2","caused him a lot of problems because he "],["1113.44","kept showing up to tell the leaders what "],["1114.799","God wanted and they kept threatening to "],["1117.52","kill him so Paul Samuel has it I think "],["1121.039","the best he doesn't have to convince the "],["1123.08","people that he's hearing from God and "],["1124.6","that they should listen to do what he "],["1126.159","says they already respect him they "],["1128","listen to him they don't even eat "],["1129.84","without him until he shows up Samuel is "],["1132.6","the most important person in the nation "],["1135.08","he is the most powerful he is the most "],["1137.48","influential what has been the "],["1139.159","consequences of that and I know that's a "],["1140.88","bit of a review question but what has "],["1142.48","been the consequences of everyone "],["1143.88","following Samuel's leadership basically "],["1145.76","30 years of Peace 30 years of victory "],["1149.76","over the Philistines it seems to be "],["1151.72","working and you know the old saying if "],["1154.32","it ain't broke don't fix it everyone "],["1158.24","must be real happy with this system "],["1161.039","right yes no no actually they're not "],["1166.4","even though it's working doesn't mean "],["1168.84","people are happy because deep down "],["1171.72","inside it's not what they desire like we "],["1175.2","learned two weeks ago in chapter 8 the "],["1177.799","title was Just Give Me A Reason looking "],["1182.48","for a reason to overhaul the system and "],["1185.48","get what they truly desired what did "],["1187.799","they truly desire a king a royal baby "],["1193.24","someone who they could glorify verse "],["1197.039","number 17 through 20 we see in the text "],["1200.679","that uh Samuel and Saul they come "],["1203.159","together and they meet each other and "],["1206.36","and Saul approaches Samuel and Samuel "],["1209.76","says I am the Seer go before me to the "],["1212","high place verse 19 you'll eat today in

"],["1240.84","you "],["1242.799","so he just wants to find his donkeys and "],["1245.44","go "],["1246.28","home that's not the plan Samuel says "],["1250","you're going to hang out here you're gon

"],["1269.919","heck would I be what Israel desires I'm "],["1272.559","just of the smallest tribe of Israel and "],["1275.24","of The Tribe of Benjamin I am just our "],["1277.6","family is the most

"],["1302.52","you know that folks that's how it ought "],["1304.32","to be not because Samuel was worthy but "],["1306.96","because Samuel was the guy who heard "],["1309.279","from God he is the Avenue through which "],["1313.559","people know God hear from God and of "],["1315.96","course can obey God he should have been "],["1319.44","the biggest thing going on the fact "],["1322.12","about

point to the character of the "],["32.719","individuals involved in the night of the "],["34.8","incident they're trying to portray the "],["37.12","individuals in a particular manner cast "],["39.64","them in a light that will support their "],["42.32","version of the events is George "],["45.12","Zimmerman a profiling racist or is he a "],["48.76","concerned citizen likewise the young man "],["52.6","Trayvon who lost his life was he a "],["54.879","dangerous hoodlum or was he just your "],["56.96","average everyday "],["58.64","teenager both both sides portray the "],["61.559","individuals in a different light "],["63.879","emphasizing the part of their character "],["65.92","that best suits their version of what "],["69.4","happened after 17 years of working with "],["72.96","people and counseling people and serving "],["76.28","people you know what I have concluded "],["78.4","about "],["79.439","people they're never just one way "],["83.759","they're never all bad or all good people "],["88.64","are not always this this and never that "],["91.6","always angry never happy always loving "],["95.32","never hateful always prideful never "],["98.24","humble always fearful never "],["102.119","courageous Pastor Rob is always willing "],["104.799","to help he'll never let you "],["107.96","down that's not "],["110.119","true I'm not always willing to help and "],["113.52","there are people who would say Pastor "],["115.84","Rob disappointed me he really let me "],["118.64","down and that would be true but if you "],["121.88","said pastor Rob never helps he'll always "],["125.759","let you "],["126.92","down that's not true either there are "],["130.08","people who would testify for me you may "],["132.959","raise your hand there are people who "],["135.76","would testify against me do not raise "],["137.599","your "],["139.319","hand and you don't want to know why that "],["141.84","is because I'm never always one thing "],["145.36","and never the "],["147.239","other in reality I have my good days I "],["150.879","have my bad days I have my moments where "],["153.12","I shine and I have my moments where I "],["156.56","stink and what I've learned in 17 years "],["159.519","is pretty well everyone else is like "],["162.599","that as well "],["165.2","complicated and "],["167.48","conflicted we're struggling with two "],["169.599","Naes people being made in the image of "],["172.84","God having conscience something within "],["175.879","us that intuitively responds to morality "],["178.84","and good and "],["180.64","truth however due to our sin nature we "],["183.959","have this side that demands for us to be "],["186.799","selfish and "],["188.76","self-service the struggle with the two "],["191.879","Natures that is the one thing we all "],["195.239","have "],["196.239","ENC I think King Saul in the Old "],["198.959","Testament illustrates that perfectly for "],["201.72","us if you were going to organize and "],["204.159","categorize the Kings of Israel you would "],["207.319","say Israel had good Kings and Israel had "],["212.239","B Kings and then you read through the "],["214.28","scripture and you say oh that was a good "],["215.84","King oo that was a stinky King right and "],["218.439","you could categorize that generally "],["221.239","speaking you would label Saul "],["225.2","a bad King right he uh was stripped of "],["229.959","the throne his family lost the throne he "],["233.12","had an evil spirit he tried to murder "],["235.439","David he died disgraced and defeated and "],["239.439","he what "],["241.04","bad King and while I wouldn't disagree "],["243.56","with you I would still have to say "],["247.28","that's not the whole picture of who Saul "],["251","was how I would categorize Saul is "],["255.16","complicated and "],["257.4","conflicted as we meet him today I want "],["260.16","you this is going to be hard because "],["262.199","you're a very educated knowledgeable "],["264","church but I want you to put aside your "],["266.56","previous knowledge about sa and focus on "],["270.16","what the text says in 1 Samuel 9 as we "],["274.72","read this and we will have it on the "],["275.919","overhead for you this morning as well uh "],["278.72","1st Samuel chapter 9 verse number one "],["281.28","there was a man of Benjamin whose name "],["283.919","was Kish the son of Abel the son of zero "],["288.24","the son of Kath the son of AIA the son "],["292.96","of a Benjamine a mighty man of "],["296.8","Valor K he had a son who name was Saul a "],["301.96","choice and handsome man and there was "],["304.8","not a more handsome person than he among "],["308.08","the sons of Israel from his shoulders up "],["311","he was taller than any of the people now "],["315.12","the donkeys of Kish Saul's father were "],["317.24","lost so Kish said to his son Saul take "],["320.28","with you one of the servants and arise "],["322.28","go search for the donkeys he passed "],["325.16","through the Hill Country of Ephraim he "],["326.8","passed through the land of shalisha they "],["329.72","did not find them he passed through the "],["331.759","land of shalim they did not find them "],["334.199","there he passed through the land of the "],["335.4","benjamites he could not find them then "],["338.4","he came to the land of Z Saul said to "],["340.639","his servant who was with him come let us "],["343.16","return or else my father will cease to "],["345.479","be concern about donkeys and he will be "],["347.56","anxious for "],["349.6","us he said to him this is the servant "],["352.639","talking now behold there is a man of God "],["355.759","in this city and the man is held in "],["357.759","honor all that he said surely comes true "],["360.56","now let us go there and perhaps he can "],["362.479","tell us about our journey on which we "],["365.36","have set out Saul said to his servant "],["368.479","but behold if we go what what will we "],["370.96","bring the man for the bread is gone from "],["373.08","our sack and there is no present to "],["375.039","bring the man of God what do we have the "],["378.08","servant answered Saul again and said "],["380.319","behold I have in my hand a fourth of the "],["382.919","Shuckle of silver I will give it to the "],["385.28","man of God and he will tell us our way "],["390.12","formerly in Israel when a man went to "],["392.08","require of God he used to say come let's "],["393.96","go to a seir for he who called a prophet "],["396.36","is now forly called a "],["398.28","SE J the Mir anyways Saul said to his "],["402.52","servant both the sheele said come let us "],["406.96","go so they went to the city where the "],["408.919","man of God was all right little "],["412.479","character study on Saul this person "],["416.639","first thing we learn about Saul is that "],["419.199","he is from The Tribe of Benjamin that's "],["423.52","right it is spoken twice good "],["425.199","observation folks as you well know the "],["428.12","nation of Israel and all the descendants "],["430.879","are all the nation of Israel are the "],["433.28","descendants of the 12 sons of Jacob God "],["436.68","changed Jacob's name to Israel which is "],["438.8","why the nation is called the children of "],["442.199","Israel that is why in the Old Testament "],["445.759","every time we are introduced to a new "],["447.96","person the author takes time to tell us "],["451.199","his tribe and his descendants which lead "],["454.4","back to the head of his "],["457.639","tribe the it is validating for us that "],["460.72","this is in fact a child of Israel which "],["464.159","means "],["465.199","what it's a big deal of being a child of "],["467.84","Israel it means that you are in a "],["470.72","covenant relationship with God the "],["474.199","promises and the blessings that God had "],["477.4","made through Abraham and and then "],["479.919","through Moses apply to the children of "],["483.72","Israel which means they apply to Saul "],["488.039","today furthermore the various Sons which "],["491.44","make up the various tribes had "],["494.84","prophecies and blessings spoken over "],["497.12","them by their fathers so whether it was "],["499.159","Ruben or whether it was Judah or whether "],["500.879","it was manasse whether it was Benjamin "],["503.08","when Jacob was old he gave these "],["505","blessings and these pronouncements over "],["507.159","his various Sons which were just for the "],["509.599","Sons personally they were for all of his "],["513.44","descendants okay of that tribe so of "],["517.76","Benjamin Jacob said Israel said in uh in "],["521.279","Genesis "],["522.36","49:27 Benjamin is a ravenous "],["527.6","wolf there you go in the morning he "],["530.44","devours the prey and in the evening he "],["532.68","divides the "],["535.44","spoil oh that's an interesting blessing "],["538.92","don't you think "],["540.279","you're called a wolf what connotation "],["544.04","does that stir up inside of us when we "],["547.6","think about being a wolf well wolves are "],["551","big strong fearful animals they clash "],["556","with humans a fair bit because they "],["558.079","steal livestock and they hunt in packs "],["560.16","and they're very dangerous they're "],["563.079","ravenous that's a good word for a wolf "],["565.16","they're ravenous they are the enemies of "],["568.279","our childhood fable right the big bad "],["573.519","wolf sounds bad to be called a wolf "],["576.88","right "],["578.64","perhaps in another sense I think it's "],["581.2","kind of a compliment being called a big "],["584.079","strong fosis Beast is better than being "],["586.88","called a "],["589.6","bunny our neighborhood is overrun with "],["591.959","bunnies anybody live in a neighborhood "],["593.24","that has nothing but bunnies everywhere "],["594.68","any yes you know what I'm talking about "],["596.959","bunnies everywhere I I

curse and "],["697.76","that's exactly what Saul is and that's "],["702.519","exactly what we are complicated and comp "],["707.839","verse one tells us that Saul's father "],["709.8","Kish was a mighty man of Valor that he "],["712.72","was respected that he had some wealth "],["715.72","that he had land and he had livestock "],["717.68","and he had servants he was blessed by "],["720.56","God and he was also blessed because he "],["723.519","has this son named Saul and Sons were a "],["728.12","blessing children are a blessing from "],["729.839","the Lord even if you got

"],["34.559","chapter 6 first samuel now the people of "],["37.04","beshemesh were reaping their "],["39.2","wheat harvest in the valley and they "],["41.6","raised their eyes and saw the ark and "],["44.079","were glad to see it "],["45.76","the cart came into the field of joshua "],["48.079","the beshemite and stood there where "],["50.48","there was a large stone and they split "],["53.44","the wood of the cart and offered the "],["55.199","cows as a burnt offering to the lord the "],["57.52","levites took down the ark "],["60.559","of the lord and the box that was with it "],["63.44","in which the articles of gold and put "],["66.08","them on the large stone and the men of "],["68","the beshemesh offered burnt offerings "],["70.32","and sacrificed sacrifices that day to "],["73.04","the lord that when the five lords of the "],["75.68","philistines saw this they returned to "],["77.84","akron that day "],["79.52","these are the golden tumors which the "],["81.759","philistines return as a guilt offering "],["84.32","to the lord one for ashdod and one for "],["87.04","gaza one for escalon and one for gath "],["90.24","and one for ekron and the golden mice "],["92.479","according to the number of all the "],["93.759","cities of the philistines belonging to "],["95.92","the five lords both the fortified cities "],["98.479","and the country villages the large stone "],["101.439","on which they set the ark of the lord is "],["103.52","a witness to this day in the field of "],["105.84","joshua the bashamite "],["108.24","sounds great everything's going lovely "],["111.119","until verse 19. "],["114.64","he struck down some of the men of "],["116.72","beshemesh because they looked into the "],["118.96","ark of the lord he struck down of the "],["121.52","people 50 070 men and the people mourned "],["126.079","because the lord had struck the people "],["128.64","with a great slaughter the men of "],["131.2","beshema said who is able to stand before "],["135.84","the lord "],["137.12","this holy god "],["139.04","and to whom "],["140.48","shall he go up from us "],["142.64","so they sent messengers to the "],["144.319","inhabitants of "],["146.8","that city right there "],["149.68","i will learn how to announce "],["152.239","saying the philistines have brought back "],["154.64","the ark of the lord come down and take "],["157.2","it up to "],["159.04","you "],["160.64","okay we're going to wrap up this whole "],["162.239","story of this account of the ark of the "],["163.84","covenant which was lost in the battle to "],["166.239","the philistines and the "],["168.239","philistines had taken the ark of the "],["169.84","covenant away from israel as a spoil of "],["171.84","war you know that they stuck it in their "],["174","temple to their god dagon as a trophy "],["177.12","and uh god did not like that very much "],["179.36","and he had a point to prove to the "],["181.2","philistines he said you don't rule me "],["184.72","dagon is not more powerful "],["186.879","i'm god "],["188.319","two plagues later and many deaths of the "],["190.64","philistines and all of their five cities "],["192.959","they got the message they wanted the ark "],["196","out of their land which i totally "],["198.8","understand why that was a logical "],["201.36","conclusion but in another sense "],["204.56","it is kind of a shame "],["207.84","it's kind of a shame that they did not "],["210.159","connect the dots and come to the "],["212.959","ultimate truth that the god of israel is "],["216.959","the one true "],["219.519","god hey let's go down there and let's "],["222.56","worship the one true god don't you think "],["225.04","that would have been the obvious "],["226.799","i think so it was obvious to them that "],["229.599","israel's god was responsible for all "],["231.36","their calamity so why not take the next "],["234.48","logical obvious conclusion and say that "],["236.56","god is more powerful than our god he is "],["238.72","worthy of glory "],["241.36","it's always kind of frustrating when "],["243.68","people cannot "],["245.12","seem to be able to connect the dots that "],["248.48","was one of my favorite games when i was "],["249.84","a young fellow was connect those little "],["251.599","puzzles connecting the dots but in our "],["253.599","culture "],["254.72","uh we have the same problem now people "],["256.799","are worshiping dagon the false god but "],["259.28","more so it is this humanistic immoral do "],["263.12","what you feel good do what you feel like "],["265.52","doing lifestyle that people are living "],["268.08","and it constantly leads people to "],["270.24","poverty and shame and for some reason "],["273.68","people cannot seem to be able to connect "],["276.72","the dots now since i've have a lot of "],["279.12","contact with the public i think i can "],["280.88","give you a relatively educated "],["283.199","observation "],["284.639","if i was going to give you the "],["286.16","ingredients "],["287.52","that make up a life of poverty time and "],["290.32","time again here's what we see and i "],["292.479","think jared you might be able to relate "],["293.919","to some of these things you're working "],["295.12","with the public you'll probably see "],["296.88","these same uh these same mistakes these "],["299.84","same individual dots first thing i "],["302.08","always see is the person has not applied "],["305.199","themselves to gain any expertise so they "],["307.84","have limited skill or limited education "],["310.08","and probably both limited skill and "],["312.16","education second of all many things that "],["314.32","lead to poverty is single parenthood "],["316.24","just because it's expensive and it's "],["318.16","hard to do it on your own but single "],["319.759","parenthood is another ingredient "],["321.919","a lack of self-control "],["324.639","a "],["325.44","poorly organized person or they have "],["327.919","some bad habits expensive vices gambling "],["331.199","drugs smoking something that is sucking "],["334","their what little money they have away "],["335.84","from them and fourthly they surround "],["338.8","themselves with people who are doing the "],["340.4","exact same things as they "],["342.479","they don't get away from those people "],["344.479","and find like a good church family or "],["346.4","people to help raise the bar the crazy "],["349.199","part is that all of those things "],["352.88","is stuff that the bible would instruct "],["354.479","you not to do "],["356.32","anyone as we learned last week who is "],["357.84","committed to believing knowing and "],["359.12","applying god's word for their lives "],["360.88","would know that that would be unwise "],["362.639","decisions the bible is not a get rich "],["364.96","manual but it certainly advises you in "],["367.44","how to avoid making choices that lead to "],["370.24","poverty it will advise you and how to "],["372.639","make choices that lead to wealth that's "],["375.12","called "],["376.16","wisdom "],["377.919","wisdom "],["378.88","i remember a fella that i went to "],["380.639","college with uh he was a good guy he was "],["383.919","a bright guy he certainly did better "],["385.919","than me in class a few years ago we "],["388.16","reconnected and got together and and "],["390.4","we're looking at each other's lives and "],["392.8","and catching up and he and he looked at "],["395.28","at me and my family and and he compared "],["397.919","to where his life was and and he said uh "],["400.72","you've been wise "],["402.639","i wish i had done those things that "],["404.639","you've done i wish "],["406.4","i was head with you head and he had the "],["409.039","same information he had the same stage "],["410.88","in life as me but where i stayed in "],["413.52","school and finished he quit and went off "],["416","and got in all kinds of trouble doing "],["417.919","things he knew way better than not to do "],["420.319","and "],["421.12","he was paying for it the rest of his "],["422.72","life "],["424.8","can you connect the dots "],["427.12","can you see the "],["428.56","big picture that all of the little "],["431.52","individual decisions and choices what "],["433.68","they "],["434.479","create "],["435.599","when they all come together what they "],["437.199","produce see the philistines couldn't do "],["438.96","that "],["439.919","instead they had a very small view of "],["442.319","who god was they said let's get him out "],["444.8","of our land "],["446.24","let's get him out of here and we'll get "],["447.599","him back to israel where he belongs well "],["450","god is bigger than one area isn't he "],["452.16","he's bigger than one piece of location "],["454.479","one bit of real estate he's bigger than "],["456.639","philistine he's bigger than israel he's "],["458.96","bigger than "],["460","everything "],["461.44","verse number 13 of course we know the "],["463.28","story they they built that little cart "],["465.28","they put that ark on it and they sent it "],["467.28","down the road with the cows to carry it "],["469.44","10 miles back into bethemesh back into "],["471.919","the land of israel the people of israel "],["473.759","were doing their wheat harvest and and "],["476.16","they raised their eyes and they see the "],["477.759","ark coming down the hill no man on the "],["480.08","cart just this cows lugging this arc and "],["482.4","they're what they're glad to see it "],["486","came into the field and they "],["488.08","they uh stood there and there was a "],["490.08","large stone and they it was a brand new "],["492","cart but they split the wood up anyways "],["493.599","and they offered it up and they took the "],["495.28","cows and they offered them up as a "],["497.28","sacrifice "],["498.639","to the lord when the israelites and the "],["500.639","folks of bashamesh first recognize "],["502.879","what's going on their what what does the "],["505.039","text say they were "],["506.72","glad they they're excited they're "],["508.56","rejoicing to see the ark coming back "],["511.039","into the land yeah we got our art back "],["514.08","it's so good to have god back on our "],["516.719","side well he really showed those "],["518.719","philistines a thing or two didn't he "],["521.279","everyone knew the ark was lost in battle "],["523.36","all of israel knew that it was a "],["524.959","horrible tragedy it was what was the "],["527.2","name ichabod "],["528.8","the what that mean "],["530.399","the glory "],["531.68","departed "],["532.88","when the lark was lost the glory "],["534.48","departed and it was such a shock to the "],["536.08","high priest life fell over backwards and "],["538.48","broke his neck when he got the news and "],["540.399","his daughter-in-law because of the loss "],["542.56","of the ark she went into premature labor "],["544.56","and the trauma killed her and they "],["546.32","hadn't had the ark for seven months now "],["549.68","obviously the israelites got word that "],["551.68","the philistines were struggling with "],["553.12","having their ark over there they got the "],["555.04","stories i'm sure i mean otherwise it "],["556.56","wouldn't be written in our bible i mean "],["558","the philistines didn't write that "],["559.04","chapter did they so they knew about that "],["561.68","uh they they're they're it was causing "],["563.92","them problems but no doubt even even "],["566.24","though they knew that they were still "],["567.36","shocked to see this unmanned cart "],["569.44","rolling down the highway "],["571.6","and by all accounts uh it seems like "],["574.16","their response was favorable and "],["575.92","appropriate right they did the "],["577.64","sacrifices and they "],["579.6","they they they did the uh the special "],["582.16","sacred stone was a memorial there and "],["585.68","the levites were there they took it down "],["587.76","and they did the burnt offerings and "],["589.12","sacrificed the sacrifices and everyone "],["591.279","was rejoicing so it seems like "],["593.76","everything was going very well "],["596.08","and then the narrative changes "],["599.12","and the mood changes doesn't it verse "],["601.92","number 19. "],["604.32","they had this big party there in the in "],["606","the field of joshua the best of might "],["608.24","verse 19 "],["609.68","he's he being god struck down some of "],["612.72","the men of besha mesh "],["614.399","because they looked into the ark of the "],["616.24","lord he struck down "],["618.72","50 070 men "],["621.68","and the people mourned because the lord "],["623.279","had "],["624","struck down the people with a great "],["626.16","slaughter "],["627.68","a great slaughter "],["630.16","so right away we go from rejoicing to "],["634.16","mourning "],["635.2","we go from rejoicing to mourning "],["639.44","the thing "],["640.959","the attitude the "],["643.44","poor theology that caused israel to lose "],["646.399","the ark to the philistines in the first "],["648.16","place "],["649.2","that issue has not been resolved yet "],["652.399","they had taken the ark of the lord out "],["654.16","to the battlefield because they thought "],["655.519","it would assure them the victory but it "],["657.36","did the opposite it assured them a huge "],["659.68","defeat where they lost 30 000 men in "],["661.68","battle "],["663.68","it wasn't israel's ark "],["666.48","and when the philistines took it in "],["668.16","battle it wasn't "],["669.76","the philistines art "],["671.92","this text tells us two times whose arc "],["674","is it "],["675.44","the ark of the "],["677.6","lord "],["678.56","it's "],["679.68","yahweh's ark "],["681.76","it's god's art and god's point to israel "],["686","is "],["687.36","i don't bless sin "],["689.44","when they lost that in battle it's i "],["691.279","won't be manipulated and do any miracles "],["693.12","for you "],["694","don't assume i'm on your side "],["696.64","it was god's art they had no business "],["698.88","moving it they had no business touching "],["701.12","it unless he told them to do so "],["705.76","god's not on a side "],["709.279","what's what's his name yahweh what does "],["711.12","that mean we've learned that before "],["713.279","i am "],["714.72","i am god is not on a side god "],["718.32","is "],["720.079","consider that for a moment "],["722.8","god is not on the side of good god "],["726.72","is good "],["728.16","god is not on the side of justice god "],["731.68","is justice god is not on the side of "],["734.16","holiness god "],["736.079","is holiness you're with me now aren't "],["737.44","you god is not on the side of light "],["739.04","which is the opposite of darkness god "],["741.68","is "],["742.72","light "],["744.639","it's not that israel was good and the "],["747.2","philistines were bad no it's "],["750.519","everyone is "],["753.279","bad "],["754.72","everyone is bad "],["756.959","and god "],["758.48","is good "],["760.399","but "],["761.44","god has provided a way for israel to "],["765.12","come to where he is "],["768.24","if they do what they are told if they "],["770.32","stay close to him then god will bless "],["772.639","them but if they want to be like "],["774.24","everyone else if they want to live with "],["776.079","sin if they move away from god they've "],["778.959","switched sides "],["781.12","verse 20 this is a timeless truth this "],["784.48","is the big idea of the text the "],["786.399","theological fact stated rhetorically for "],["789.519","us to ponder who can stand before the "],["793.36","lord "],["794.48","this "],["795.68","holy "],["797.2","god "],["799.68","and the answer is "],["802.72","nobody "],["804.16","nobody can stand before god "],["808.079","god is not on your side "],["810.88","god "],["812.839","is and they find that out the hard way "],["815.68","don't they "],["816.639","how many people die "],["818.88","50 070 "],["821.279","men "],["822.16","because why what's the state of reason "],["824.079","why all this slaughter "],["826.56","said here because they "],["828.88","they looked into "],["830.88","the ark "],["833.44","what's crazy is that they they popped "],["835.6","that lid up and they looked into that "],["836.959","arc despite the levites being there did "],["839.36","you notice that the levites were there "],["841.44","when the game and they got the ark down "],["843.76","and they made the big "],["845.04","sacrifices the levites were there in "],["847.199","attendance "],["848.48","they ought to have known "],["850.079","the levites ought to said hey hey hey "],["851.839","wait wait carolyn you don't just stroll "],["853.199","down there lift the lid "],["859.279","that just shows you how far away the "],["862","nation is moved from knowing and obeying "],["865.44","god's laws but "],["867.199","you know that is a reoccurring theme "],["869.44","in all of israel that's a reoccurring "],["872.24","theme for the nation "],["873.839","and even in our own churches "],["876.399","the spiritual leaders "],["878","tend to not know or believe god's word "],["880.959","before the fall of jerusalem you think "],["882.56","about back in the old testament the "],["884.48","destruction of the jerusalem and the "],["886.16","temple in 900 bc when nebuchadnezzar and "],["888.8","babylon were going to roll in there what "],["890.56","were all of the prophets and all of the "],["892.24","priests saying "],["893.68","god is with us right peace and safety "],["896.24","the only one saying opposite was "],["897.36","jeremiah and they're like we didn't get "],["898.32","out of here jeremiah stop giving us this "],["899.839","bad news and nobody else knew the word "],["902.32","of the lord and uh they weren't teaching "],["904.48","it they weren't confronting the sin and "],["906","then again in the new testament when the "],["908.56","the romans came in and destroyed "],["910","jerusalem and destroyed the temple what "],["912.16","had happened just a few years prior to "],["913.92","that the crucifixion of christ the "],["916.079","religious leaders had rejected the "],["917.839","messiah and they glorified themselves "],["920.079","they disobeyed god and again god "],["922.32","destroyed and they lost all of that and "],["924.959","we today we see the same things "],["926.48","happening around us when religious "],["928","leaders reject the authority of "],["929.6","scripture they reject literal "],["931.279","interpretation they only teach what "],["933.44","people want to hear the levites ought to "],["936.16","known that it wasn't safe to casually "],["937.76","walk up and curiously handle the ark "],["940.8","we should know better too "],["942.56","what's holy and what isn't "],["944.959","spiritual leaders ought to be telling us "],["946.24","but you know some people are like that "],["947.519","aren't they some people are just "],["948.56","naturally curious "],["950.32","and they just got to poke around "],["952.48","check everything who do you know "],["955.04","do you know who's like that who would be "],["956.72","the first one to just go over and "],["959.519","check to see what was inside of that "],["965.44","yeah you got it "],["966.959","when ricky was four years old "],["970.639","we had him

and verse n really jumped out "],["165.08","at me because this sounds so very "],["168.08","typical don't you think they're s "],["170.36","they're saying we're going to do this "],["172.36","and if this works out in this way then "],["174.519","we'll know it was the Lord but if it "],["176.76","doesn't and we know it wasn't the Lord "],["178.519","it was just chance "],["180.48","May we're

"],["189.44","this what he's trying to say what does "],["191.799","God want there's a title for this past "],["194.599","some trying to give me to figure out "],["196.879","what does

to "],["206.08","get this persecution and his heavy hand "],["208.56","off of us and it's seems to me they "],["211.159","stumbled onto it and I thought if the "],["215","Pagan Philistines can figure

"],["337.36","think I can generally give them my "],["338.88","opinion but what if I misread a "],["340.72","situation what if my opinion is wrong "],["342.56","what if I apply a motive to God that

"],["391.639","something else but let's observe the "],["393.24","passage I think there's some good "],["395.56","practical principles that we can help us "],["398.52","that can help us make honoring

anything you need to know if "],["431.24","the thing you're going to do is "],["432.319","something that God would be for or is it "],["435.639","something he would be against this is "],["438.639","called the decreed will of God the "],["441.759","decreed will of God I'm going to give "],["443.199","you a little bit of the theology this "],["444.84","morning the decreed will of God the "],["447.44","thing that I know is a fact something "],["451.12","that God honors I know it's a fact "],["453.639","because it's "],["455.08","spoken in his word right it's something "],["457.599","that he is specifically commanded I "],["460.599","don't have to wonder if God wants me to "],["463.599","worship Him does God want me to go to "],["466.159","church do I know that for a fact yes "],["468.4","it's in the word isn't it uh do should I "],["470.84","love people should I get a job right "],["474.8","should I help people should should I "],["477.12","these things are things that he said in "],["478.599","his word should I be forgiving should I "],["480.28","speak the truth I I'm not unsure if "],["482.72","murdering someone is okay or not right I "],["485.68","know what God has said about fornication "],["487.879","or homosexuality or stealing or "],["490.08","drunkenness or Rebellion or witch flap "],["492.28","or foolishness or lying or adultery I "],["496","know what he said on those things if any "],["498.599","activity I think God wants me to do is "],["502.8","violating his spoken word then I'm wrong "],["507.56","and the Bible's right okay "],["509.96","that's called that's what we say when we "],["511.96","mean God's word is authoritative when we "],["514.8","say Authority theologically we mean the "],["517.64","right to command belief and action we "],["520.36","believe God is the ultimate Authority "],["524.519","what he says goes and God delegated his "],["528.72","authority "],["530.2","to the Bible to his word the Bible "],["533.68","carries God's message the Bible carries "],["536.68","the same weight as if God himself s was "],["540.32","standing here speaking to us personally "],["542.16","because he would not contradict himself "],["544","and what he said there is the same thing "],["546.079","he'd say today God would not contradict "],["548.959","himself so this is God speaking to us "],["552.399","personally this is what this church "],["554.36","believes this is what this church "],["555.88","teaches and we attempt to live by it "],["558.16","we're not perfect at it but we're trying "],["561.279","we're trying our best but here's the "],["563.04","point for you if you or your parents or "],["567.36","a teacher or a preacher or a church "],["569.399","nomination or a doctor an expert the "],["572.48","government or an angel of Heaven tells "],["575.56","you something that contradicts the word "],["577.36","of "],["578.2","God the Bible's to find Authority ignore "],["581.64","that Source ignore that person Galatians "],["584.8","1 verse number eight but even if we Paul "],["587.079","says or an angel from heaven preaches "],["589.6","any other gospel to you except what we "],["591.56","have preached let him be a curse Jesus "],["594.12","said in John 14:21 he who has my "],["597.12","Commandments and keeps them it is is he "],["599.72","who loves me he

who are loving God and John "],["613","writes in 1 John 4:1 beloved do not "],["615.959","believe every Spirit but test the "],["619.48","spirits whether they are of God because "],["622.24","many

doing contradicting "],["632.6","what God's word says now the Philistines "],["635.839","they have some part of the recorded word "],["639","of God don't they what part did they "],["641.959","have what was the part that we kept "],["644.04","talking about the last couple weeks that "],["645.519","they keep talking "],["647.16","about I'm going to wait for yall I know "],["649.24","you know this "],["650.32","one they mentioned a couple times "],["652.6","another Nation who was that the "],["656.2","Egyptians right they they they're "],["658.2","talking about what God God had done the "],["660.36","historical account of Egypt and the "],["662.76","plagues and Israel coming out and how it "],["665.48","destroyed the nation of Egypt because "],["667.56","they went up and they they competed with "],["669.68","The God Who shuts the mouth of lions who "],["672.36","causes the dead to rise and all the "],["674.24","things we sung about they found out who "],["676.76","was The Great

about that God they knew "],["692.88","about what happened to Egypt by the way "],["694.36","how long ago was that for them that "],["696.279","happened 400 years I keep stressing that "],["698.92","because that's amazing and despite it "],["700.76","happened 400 years ago did these guys "],["702.6","did these Philistines question the "],["704.079","authenticity of that event did they "],["706.56","question the historicity of that event "],["708.72","no they took the word of God as literal "],["712.44","they know the god of Israel is real and "],["714.959","is powerful that he can and that he does "],["718.279","judge and these priests they do not have "],["720.399","access to a Bible they don't go to "],["722.48","church like we have a whole Bible the "],["724.2","whole complete revelation of the word of "],["725.88","God and we have church we can go to each "],["727.56","week they didn't have all that they know "],["729.44","very little compared to you and I but "],["731.639","what they did know they believed and "],["735.12","they accepted it and they applied it to "],["738.04","their current decision making didn't "],["740.279","they applied it and that's what you and "],["742.519","I have to do that's the first step to "],["745.04","making wise god-honoring decisions in "],["747.839","our life is to believe believe know and "],["751.56","apply the word of God believe know and "],["754.639","apply the word of God if you truly "],["756.44","believe this is God's word then you "],["758.44","ought to want to know it so that you can "],["761.639","apply it if you're not interested in "],["763.839","knowing or applying the Bible to your "],["766.16","life then I would conclude that you "],["767.839","don't truly believe that this is God's "],["770.079","word because one's belief affects one's "],["773.8","actions one's beliefs affects one's "],["776.639","actions some people know a lot of "],["778.6","information "],["780.279","they know what's in the Bible but they "],["782.44","don't believe it some people would claim "],["784.839","they believe it but they don't really "],["786.76","know it do they but the person who "],["789.079","applies it and who lives it shows that "],["791.56","they know it and that they believe it "],["794.519","but I can't stress this one enough "],["796.36","because there are many people who claim "],["798.279","they're doing things for God and yet "],["800.079","they're disobeying his word in one "],["802.279","activity they say they're trying to "],["803.519","serve God but then in another part of "],["805.399","life they're totally disregarding his "],["807.36","word but you don't please God by dis "],["809.8","obeying parents would you agree me on "],["811.88","that the kids don't please you by "],["813.16","disobeying do they you don't please God "],["816.04","by disobeying you you don't know how "],["818.639","thankful I am to be part of a church "],["821.399","where people want to believe know and "],["823.48","apply the Bible lots of people assume "],["826.16","everything they do is Godly and they "],["828.32","will not submit themselves to hearing "],["830.639","anything otherwise but I find people "],["833.079","here really do want biblical counsel and "],["836.48","ultimately that's the number one thing "],["837.8","we're attempting to do here Bible Church "],["839.92","we're trying to strengthen your belief "],["841.839","through your knowledge so that you can "],["843.639","apply God's word to your

honest with the facts be "],["875.12","honest with the facts the Philistines "],["876.839","know God "],["878.6","judges the facts are we're experiencing "],["882.199","some judgments around here we got some "],["885.079","tumors and places that is very "],["886.8","inconvenient to have tumors we've got "],["889.16","mice running all over the place eating "],["890.8","all of our stuff we got our God falling "],["893.44","down on its face and breaking its head "],["895","and hands off before the Ark of the "],["896.72","Covenant of God there's the fact "],["899.759","so their knowledge of God's word which "],["901.68","tells them that what God does combined "],["903.759","with the facts of what they're currently "],["905.279","experiencing helps them conclude we have "],["907.839","upset the god of Israel and he doesn't "],["910.44","want us to have this Ark he wants this "],["912.44","Ark out of our land so we need to "],["916.639","combine the application of God's truth "],["919.079","with the facts that we have in front of "],["920.88","us to help us make God honoring "],["923.36","decisions let me give you a personal "],["925.6","example that that that impacted uh us "],["928.399","personally and impacts many of you I "],["930.519","want to use this as an illustration but "],["932.519","many of the families here if you've got "],["934.759","children you're you're dealing with this "],["936.48","this question what is God's will for my "],["939.279","children's "],["940.36","education is it public school is it "],["943.759","Christian School is it "],["946.36","homeschool now I think I can speak "],["948.8","honestly and openly on this topic "],["950.6","because we have done all three so I've "],["953","been in all three places doing all three "],["956.04","uh all three Styles first off "],["959.639","there is no Thou shalt or Thou shalt not "],["962.279","command on the Bible on this one it's "],["965.48","not there so then you have to now work "],["968.319","with the facts when we were living in "],["971.36","Canada the facts were there was no "],["973.44","Christian schools in our area so we "],["975.6","couldn't send them to Christian School "],["976.68","that wasn't God's will there wasn't one "],["977.92","there we had a very good very structured "],["981","School environment available to us in "],["983.12","the public school system and our kids "],["985.079","did very well in that system when we "],["987.16","left Canada and we moved here for 3 "],["989.12","years when I was the Seminary we were in "],["990.44","a great period of transition and at that "],["993.199","time homeschooling made the best sense "],["995.44","for us and uh we did that for two years "],["998.44","but we also at the same time we really "],["1000.44","needed Iana to be working so that we "],["1002.48","could survive and so that we could eat "],["1004.44","so that was hard for her to work and to "],["1006.839","homeschool she did both for a while but "],["1009.12","it was wearing her out at this time we "],["1011.959","were living up in uh Atlanta Maryland in "],["1014.56","the public school system of PG County "],["1017.24","that just did not look like a good "],["1019.24","option for us so we uh we stuck with the "],["1022.04","homeschooling as long as we could but "],["1024.439","then a Christian School asked Elana if "],["1026.64","she would teach and they would be "],["1028.52","willing to let our kids come for no cost "],["1031.24","which was perfect because that's exactly "],["1032.64","what we had to give them so uh we took "],["1035.52","that option once again we moved here and "],["1037.919","we had to explore all three options "],["1040.24","again we had wonderful Christian "],["1041.559","teachers in our Public Schools Roberto "],["1043.76","had some great teachers as friend of "],["1045.36","middle school there's a fact Roberto did "],["1048.559","not particularly like the homeschooling "],["1050.28","environment when he was doing that "],["1052.28","there's a fact your "],["1053.919","children's feelings your children's "],["1057","personalities and their Styles those are "],["1058.76","facts you have to deal with there that's "],["1060.559","part of the equation Ricky and Tony both "],["1062.52","did very well in homeschooling and "],["1064","enjoyed it but Ricky wanted to be in the "],["1065.919","class with other kids that was a fact "],["1067.799","Tony loved homeschool but didn't want to "],["1069.919","do it by himself there's a "],["1073.44","fact there were some very strong worldly "],["1076.52","influences in our local high school that "],["1079.159","we wanted uh to avoid as much as "],["1081.28","possible that's another fact Christian "],["1083.84","School is a big Financial commitment and "],["1085.919","we couldn't afford it on my salary alone "],["1088.64","that's a fact it would require Elana "],["1091.039","working if we were going to do "],["1093.799","that she just didn't want to do that "],["1096.12","that was a fact Kings Christian Academy "],["1099.12","had a job opening that fit Elana's "],["1100.96","expertise and they asked her would you "],["1102.32","please come fill this position there's a "],["1105.32","fact So based on all of those facts we "],["1109.799","made our decision on where our kids are "],["1112.12","at school at this time but that's my "],["1114.6","situation that's not your situation the "],["1118.4","facts may be different for you so I "],["1120.48","would not tell you that the choice I "],["1122.72","have made is the right choice our choice "],["1125.64","was right for us because God opened "],["1127.679","those doors for us but he may not be "],["1131","doing that for you

offering "],["927.04","well according to the law of Moses the "],["929.279","guilt offering was a special kind of "],["931.72","offering that was required in cases "],["934.48","where someone had been denied their "],["936.36","rightful due the value "],["939.04","withheld had to be given back to the "],["941.36","person on top of that a "],["944.199","20% of whatever that value withheld a "],["947.399","20% was tacked onto it so if someone had "],["950.44","been someone had committed fraud they "],["952.959","had to make a guilt offering so whether "],["955.24","you were cheating somebody or robbing "],["957.72","somebody oress ing someone failing to "],["960.959","report uh findings of Lost Property was "],["964.68","also fraud you know we like growing up "],["966.759","we used to say Finders Keepers losers "],["969.92","weepers right but that's really not a "],["972.839","Biblical that's not in the Bible just so "],["974.68","you know that's not a b no uh failure to "],["978.319","uh failure to report stolen property was "],["981.48","considered a frauding somebody false "],["984.8","swearing or failing to testify whether l "],["989.12","about somebody swearing against them or "],["991.199","failing to even Testify the person made "],["994.8","who did that had to make a guilt "],["996.48","offering had to confess his sin he had "],["998.519","to make restoration what was taken and "],["1000.399","then he had to give another 20% so "],["1004.199","basically some activity where you have "],["1006.639","benefited by taking for someone "],["1008.519","something that didn't belong to you "],["1010","whether it was through cheating or "],["1011.04","robbing oppressing failing to report the "],["1013.72","findings of Lost Property false swearing "],["1016","or failing to testify would require the "],["1019.36","guilt offering okay so which of those "],["1021.279","are the Philistine Lords guilty of the "],["1024.439","priest said you got to make a guilt "],["1025.799","offering which one of those are they "],["1027.88","guilty of initially in their mind they "],["1030.64","would say that we are guilty of none of "],["1034.6","that none of the above we won that Ark "],["1038.64","of the god of Israel in battle we took "],["1042.64","that fair and square we beat them that "],["1045.88","would be called a spoil

"],["1110.559","the Philistine Lords would not take this "],["1113.12","advice and admit their guilt and offer "],["1115.84","the offering which is why they say in "],["1117.88","verse number six they

"],["644.12","people likewise the devil and demons can "],["647.399","interact with men there are all kinds of "],["649.36","stories in the Bible and plenty more not "],["651.279","in the Bible about demonic activity the "],["654.04","number one thing that the devil and the "],["655.92","demons are trying to do is they're "],["658.48","trying to keep people from worshiping "],["660.56","the one true God for years their "],["664.92","strategy what they would do is they "],["666.6","would present themselves as gods and "],["670","they would claim that they were worthy "],["672.32","of worship the false gods of Antiquities "],["675","the false Pagan religions were "],["677.36","demonically "],["679.04","inspired so there is something real some "],["683.68","spiritual being with ability behind Deon "],["688.12","and behind the false religions but what "],["690.959","they are not is they're not gods they "],["694.2","are not in control of anything the false "],["697.839","religions claim that these gods were the "],["699.76","gods of the Sun or the moon or the "],["701.36","fertility or weather the sea the "],["704.24","mountain death or love or war and they "],["707.959","imply by calling them gods that they "],["709.88","have Power Authority control and "],["712.72","Dominion but that was all a lie there "],["717.079","was is and only ever will be one God "],["720.88","with power and authority and dominion "],["723.76","over all creation that is the god of "],["726","Israel the god of the Bible all these "],["728.8","other false gods are demons who do some "],["731.6","P

"],["740.48","would believe them so why don't we see "],["743.44","them around "],["744.639","today well first of all nobody said that "],["747","you won't or you can't see them around "],["748.92","today some people have experienced "],["751.56","demons and have had to deal with them "],["753.56","but it seems to me that the demons have "],["755.839","switched their strategies that they have "],["758.68","dropped the god label and now they work "],["760.839","more undercover to have people believe "],["763.279","that they don't exist because they got "],["766.04","exposed and beaten so badly in the past "],["768.72","when they pretended to be Gods let me "],["770.519","illustrate that through history first of "],["772.639","all uh with Biblical history we see "],["774.68","today uh in this account of Deon and you "],["777.32","see in many other accounts in Scripture "],["779.399","that all of these false gods that went "],["781.079","up against the god of

are just "],["795.24","as much a tendency to rebel against "],["797.72","false gods as we do the true God we "],["800.36","rebel against anything that tries to "],["802.04","rule over us and all of the Supreme "],["804.32","conquerors down through history and "],["806.8","Antiquities they all wanted to be "],["808.36","worshiped "],["809.8","themselves right the Pharaohs "],["812.959","Nebuchadnezzar Darius Alexander the "],["816","Great all of the Caesars they all "],["817.72","claimed to be they all said I am God I "],["820.959","am they all claim to be Gods these guys "],["824","went all around the world and they "],["825.88","smashed everyone's individual cultures "],["828.36","they destroyed all of these people and "],["829.959","when they conquered them they would take "],["831.56","all of their treasures and all their "],["833.519","holy relics just like the Philistines "],["835.68","did and they'd lug it back to their "],["837.32","Temple and say see our God is stronger "],["839.399","than your God and what would happen is "],["841.16","is was these Global world powers would "],["843","come up they would destroy all of the "],["845","local people all of their local Customs "],["846.92","all their local be beliefs they would "],["848.759","defeat all of their gods and then they "],["851.079","would have only the gods of their their "],["852.839","Race So this went on and on all down "],["854.88","through the the uh ages all these "],["856.92","different powers that come along would "],["859.6","conquer and of course the last World "],["861.48","Empire that conquered and destroyed "],["863.04","everybody's Gods was Rome right Rome "],["866.079","beat everybody and they said our gods "],["867.6","are powerful than your gods "],["869.32","and then the Caesars themselves said "],["872.079","actually we're Gods we are the gods that "],["873.759","did this but then Rome fell to what "],["878","God what God conquered "],["882.279","Rome Jesus Christ wasn't it was "],["887","Christianity that came in and conquered "],["890.12","Rome once Jesus came on the scene and "],["892.759","the church received the power to cast G "],["895.279","demons out in jesus' name all the demons "],["897.759","got exposed the church had power and the "],["900.519","church grew and despite the opposition "],["903","and the persecution and being hung in "],["904.92","Neo's garden and lit on fire and being "],["906.88","fed to Lions people wouldn't abandon "],["908.92","their belief in Jesus they kept growing "],["911","and growing and growing and eventually "],["913.6","it overtook Rome and became the official "],["916.519","religion of the Roman Empire and "],["919.959","officially destroyed all ancient gods "],["922.68","and left them all in the anals of "],["924.199","history as being false "],["926.8","religions you see this with powers that "],["929.279","come up they destroy all the "],["931.12","superstitions all the traditions of "],["932.72","people even recently if you know the "],["935.16","history of China communist China went in "],["939.319","when communism came into China it "],["941.399","destroyed all of the Pagan all the false "],["944.079","gods of China China was never really "],["947.079","United was all these different regions "],["949.319","all these small areas with all these "],["950.92","individual dialects these different "],["952.88","languages and all these different "],["954.199","customs and beliefs and no it's very "],["956.48","hard to bring a people together and "],["958","unite them if they have different "],["959.199","languages and different beliefs but when "],["961.199","communism came into China Mao said "],["963.72","everyone's got to speak the same "],["965.16","language you have to learn this language "],["967.88","and everyone has to be able to read "],["969.399","because y'all got to be able to read my "],["970.56","little red book right that's what he "],["972.6","wanted them to do and he said y'all have "],["974.68","to speak this language and y'all have to "],["976.279","read and there is no Gods uh communism "],["979.199","is what atheistic right they don't "],["981.48","believe in gods they said there is no "],["982.92","Gods if you believe in any Gods we're "],["984.639","going to kill you all so there we'll see "],["986.079","if your God can protect you and what did "],["987.759","everyone do "],["989.199","everyone saidwell I guess we better read "],["991.319","the book learn the language and drop "],["992.639","these silly Gods right because they did "],["994.519","not have power to protect them they did "],["997.56","not have power to uh to take care of "],["1000.88","their worshippers these little demon "],["1002.56","Gods so that is what happened in in "],["1005.04","China and uh consequently because of all "],["1008.079","of that what religion did manage to "],["1010.92","survive and did grow in China "],["1013.199","Christianity there are over a hundred "],["1015.44","million Christians that live underground "],["1017.8","in uh not literally underground but the "],["1020.04","the church that's we say an underground "],["1021.56","church is they have to stay in hiding "],["1023.56","because of the oppression of the state "],["1025.079","but all these other false religions "],["1026.48","people will give that stuff up when "],["1027.72","they're going to die but people will die "],["1029.6","for Jesus people will die for the true "],["1031.839","God and that's what's happened over "],["1033.72","there in our culture we see that science "],["1036.199","has come along through through the "],["1037.439","Industrial

"],["1045.88","the Pagan religions would say well this "],["1047.439","disease is because of the gods or this "],["1049.799","thing happened in nature because of the "],["1051.32","Gods and and we've learned now that well "],["1053.36","you know it's because of germs and "],["1055.039","because of bacteria and and we we've "],["1057.16","learned all this science so we we we've "],["1059.76","said well there we we've come to the "],["1061.28","conclusion well there must not be any "],["1062.76","Gods so what has happened is demons have "],["1064.96","switched their strategy they don't try "],["1066.84","to be outwardly worshiped anymore they "],["1068.679","stay hidden and try to promote the lie "],["1070.919","that well we don't really exist and "],["1072.799","matter of fact there is no such thing as "],["1074.679","a spiritual realm and there is no such "],["1076.4","thing as a God the ancient people knew "],["1079.2","there was a god they never would have "],["1081.559","believed the lie that people here in the "],["1083.28","western culture believe that there is no "],["1085.24","such thing as God they they they they "],["1087.799","knew there was a spiritual real and uh "],["1090.52","so what the demons would do is they "],["1091.88","would say well we are the gods but today "],["1095.12","people are don't believe in the "],["1097.12","spiritual they just tend to believe "],["1098.52","there is no God and so the demons "],["1100.72","reinforce that lie by staying hidden so "],["1103.6","what you see is extremes don't you don't "],["1105.36","people always tend to go to extremes you "],["1107.36","know either they're believing everything "],["1108.72","all this stuff or we don't believe "],["1110.159","anything about spiritual "],["1112.08","things you probably won't see any demons "],["1114.799","unless you hang out with the places that "],["1117","they hang out or you use their stuff and "],["1119.679","I could go into a whole lot of teaching "],["1121.36","on that but to summarize sin is their "],["1123.84","stuff and sin gives them access to you "],["1127.24","which is why we need to keep very short "],["1129","accounts in our sin right New Testament "],["1132","teaches us be angry and sin not don't "],["1134.919","let the sun go down in your wrath why "],["1136.6","because you give place to the

"],["329.639","problem of knowing it it's the problem "],["331.12","of what reading it and doing it once you "],["335.039","get it right so the nation has the laws "],["337.68","and they have God

people don't even "],["399.52","know that they're in a spiritual battle "],["401.12","until their lives and their homes are "],["403.24","being destroyed and then only because "],["406.319","there's so much pain in their lives and "],["408.639","they can't take it anymore then they "],["410.44","will finally start paying attention and "],["412.319","recognize what is going on it is in a "],["414.68","time of Crisis or in a time of pain a "],["416.879","time of desperation when they will cry "],["419.16","out out and when you cry out to God when "],["422.039","you cry out to Jesus

"],["479.919","battle they were at ebenezzer and the "],["482.24","Philistines were at APAC and the "],["484.12","Philistines drew a battle array to meet "],["486","Israel when the battle spread Israel "],["488.56","whipped up on the "],["489.879","Philistines no wait what does it say "],["492.36","Israel was defeated before the "],["495.759","Philistines and 4,000 men were killed on "],["499.12","the battlefield the nation has gone out "],["501.8","to the Philistines to fight them let's "],["503.479","learn about the Philistines a little bit "],["504.879","this morning a little bit of background "],["506.24","or history the Egyptians called the "],["508.599","philistine "],["509.919","the sea people the sea people because "],["512","they were from this area right in here "],["515.12","originally they come from the aan sea "],["518.2","this is the island of creit in the "],["519.68","Mediterranean Ocean and this is the uh "],["523.2","Isles of Greece and they had migrated "],["526.64","down into this area this is Egypt down "],["528.64","here of course the nation of Israel will "],["530.36","be right in this area and they had "],["532.08","migrated and they had set up colonies in "],["534.76","that area not really sure what prompted "],["537.04","these people to kind of move out of this "],["538.64","area down into this area but they had "],["540.64","been in the land for a while it says in "],["542.76","Genesis "],["543.92","21:34 Abraham had stayed in the land of "],["547.279","the Philistines me many days so Abraham "],["550.16","of course was the father of the nation "],["551.32","of Israel and that puts them in the land "],["553.48","around "],["554.56","1900 BC the Philistines were very "],["557.72","forceful very aggressive people they "],["560.399","liked to fight uh it says here in uh in "],["564.6","um here's a map right here I want to "],["566.519","show "],["567.519","you uh this is their land right in here "],["571.64","and this is Egypt here and then this is "],["573.6","the promised land where the Israelites "],["575.36","live of course here's Jerusalem so "],["577.399","they're right on their border and it "],["579.48","tells us in Exodus 13:1 17 when Moses "],["583.04","led the nation of Israel out of Egypt "],["585.88","and to take them into the promised land "],["588.12","that uh the Lord knew that the nation of "],["590.279","Israel was not ready to face these guys "],["592.8","and it said that when the king to pass "],["594.76","Pharaoh had led the people go God did "],["596.839","not lead them by the way of the land of "],["598.48","the Philistines although it was near God "],["600.76","said L perhaps these people change their "],["602.839","mind when they see war and turn return "],["605.959","to Egypt so give me the map again "],["608","instead of taking them the shorter route "],["610.16","which would have been from this area uh "],["612.92","directly into the land God sent them "],["615.36","send me send me the two slides back "],["616.959","there real quick there rest one yeah "],["619.2","instead of going this way directly into "],["621.32","the land god LED and and uh Moses LED "],["625.12","them all down around here for 40 years "],["629.16","and then up into the land this way "],["631.6","because they were just too rough and God "],["635.639","said these little slave people are not "],["637.279","going to be able to handle going "],["639.079","directly through the Philistines land he "],["640.88","can't hit them right away the "],["643.6","Philistines were so powerful that they "],["645.32","actually challenged the Egyptians and "],["647.72","even though Egypt was very established "],["649.399","and very powerful they had to fight very "],["651.639","hard to keep the Philistines from "],["654.519","advancing the Philistines power org me "],["656.839","that other map now was based in five "],["658.56","major cities here in ashod ashalon echon "],["664.399","gath and you can see that's all right on "],["666.2","Israel's border and then of course Gaza "],["669.399","now I'm sure you recognize one of the "],["670.88","names of these city which one do you "],["672.519","recognize Gaza that's right we're always "],["675","hearing about Gaza because Gaza Strip "],["677.8","today is a Palestinian stronghold from "],["680.8","which many terrorists still attack "],["683.2","Israel even today so even though the "],["685.399","events of Samuel are 3,000 years old "],["689.639","the same stuff is going on today which "],["692.32","really makes us understand that this is "],["694.279","so much more than a political issue or a "],["696.72","land issue this is a spiritual battle "],["701.56","then as it is today the same spiritual "],["704.32","forces that are Waring against God's "],["706.12","chosen people 3,000 years ago are still "],["708.48","trying to destroy God's chosen people "],["710.519","and still trying to destroy God's "],["713.44","purposes for the nation of "],["715.399","Israel these five cities were ruled by "],["718.2","five Warlord Lords who would all work "],["720.72","together to make decisions and to uh "],["722.88","work in unity and fight in unity a key "],["725.32","to the Philistines dominance in Warfare "],["727.48","was that they were more advanced as a "],["729.24","material culture the Israelites and the "],["731.48","Canaanites were uh still in the Bronze "],["734","Age practicing the Bronze Age uh uh "],["736.72","skills meanwhile the Philistines had "],["738.68","Advanced into the Iron Age culture which "],["741.24","made them really Invincible in battle "],["743.76","and in war if anybody watches the uh the "],["746.959","uh Greatest Warrior that show that "],["748.68","sometimes on History Channel when they "],["750.199","pit one Warrior against another usually "],["752.399","it's the Weaponry that makes the "],["754.76","difference and we learn in later on in a "],["756.959","passage in 1st Samuel chapter 13 that "],["759.56","the nation of Israel did not have even "],["761.959","any blacksmiths to make any equipment "],["763.88","they were so depleted it says in verse "],["766.199","19 that there wasn't any blacksmiths in "],["768.48","all the land the Philistines had kind of "],["770.959","wiped them all out and wouldn't let them "],["772.279","have them said unless they make what "],["774.24","swords or spears so the Israelites when "],["777","they went up to fight the Philistines "],["778.32","later on we're going to learn they were "],["780.36","using plow points and axes and sickles "],["784","uh it was expensive to sharpen these "],["786","things to sharpen a pitchfork or a go on "],["789.72","the day they went to battle Saul and "],["791.32","Jonathan had a sword or spear not a "],["793.88","soldier had a sword or spear only Saul "],["796.519","and Jonathan had a sword and everybody "],["799.079","else was using some farm equipment "],["801.92","that's what they were using just "],["803.36","something out of the garage here I got a "],["805.16","spade you know and they're going out to "],["806.6","fight with that well meanwhile the uh "],["809.88","the the Philistines had all this body "],["812","armor had all this equipment we saw this "],["815.12","in the Book of Judges likewise when "],["816.92","Samson was fighting the Philistines what "],["819.48","did he "],["820.399","have he just grabbed a Jawbone of a "],["822.72","donkey off the ground and said I'm ready "],["824.199","bring it right that's what he had as a "],["826.16","battle he used his bare hands and then "],["827.959","we see later on and we're going to see "],["829.519","this in chapter 17 uh young David when "],["832.88","he goes up against the giant Philistine "],["835.199","Goliath Goliath had all this body armor "],["837.88","he had so much armor he had a shield "],["839.68","Bearer who would carry a shield for him "],["841.72","he had all this equipment the javelin "],["843.56","and the swords and David had what he had "],["847","a homemade sling and as he was going out "],["849.839","to battle he picked up some Stones off "],["851.6","the ground on his way out you know how's "],["853.639","that for Preparation you know he oh let "],["855.68","me get my stuff okay we're ready you "],["857.399","know just like samon oh here's a Jawbone "],["859.399","I'll take at you with that that's what "],["860.959","he had to work with we'll get into that "],["863.24","story more that's chapter 17 sometime in "],["865.639","the next decade we'll get to chapter 17 "],["868.24","but d understood something he's going up "],["871.32","to face this 9-foot Warrior he "],["874.44","understands this is not a physical "],["876.199","battle he said I don't need all the "],["878.56","armor because I'm not fighting a "],["880.72","physical battle Goliath didn't "],["882.44","understand that he laughed at David's "],["884.16","size he laughed at his sling and his "],["886.88","Stones he cursed David and he cursed "],["889.68","David's God but that didn't make David "],["891.959","back down did he what did David say 1st "],["894.04","Samuel 17:45 you come at me with a sword "],["897.16","and a spear and a

"],["29","it was rare was because people weren't "],["31.64","keen on listening to it it was rare "],["34.96","because nobody was speaking it but if "],["39.04","people would be receptive to hear the "],["41.079","word and people would be willing to "],["42.92","speak the word of the Lord then it won't "],["45.76","be won be R that's where we left Samuel "],["50.12","last week saying Young

"],["98.119","response it's nice and encouraging when "],["100.92","people pay me compliments but it's far "],["103.439","better when people actually go out and "],["105.079","do the stuff that we're learning that's "],["107.68","a much better application when you take "],["110.2","the word of Truth and start implementing "],["112.079","the principles in living out the word "],["115.36","that's better than feeling it now if I "],["117.719","can get you to do both if I can get you "],["119.96","to feel it and do it then hey that would "],["122.92","be awesome so Samuel says Speak "],["128.08","Lord let's find out what exactly God "],["131.68","spoke 1 Samuel "],["134.959","3:1 through 21 let's pick it up verse 10 "],["137.68","since that's such a powerful verse the "],["139.56","Lord came and stood called as other "],["142.16","times Samuel Samuel Samuel said speak "],["145.68","for your servant is "],["147.519","listening the Lord said to Samuel "],["150.879","behold I'm about to do a thing in Israel "],["154","at which both the ears of everyone who "],["155.959","hear it will tingle in that day I will "],["159.239","carry out against Eli all that I've "],["160.959","spoken concerning his house from "],["163.08","beginning to end for I have told him "],["166.64","that I'm about to judge his house "],["168.48","forever for the iniquity which he knew "],["170.68","because his sons brought a curse on them "],["173","and did not and he did not rebuke them "],["175.44","therefore I have sworn to the house of "],["178","Eli that the

"],["193.68","slept had sleepless "],["197","night then he opened the doors of the "],["199.2","house of the "],["200.4","Lord Samuel was afraid to tell the "],["203.04","vision to Eli Eli called to Samuel and "],["206.48","said Samuel my son he said here am I he "],["209.959","said what is the word that he spoke to "],["211.56","you please do not hide it from me may "],["214.04","God do to you and more also if you hide "],["217.04","anything from me for all the words he "],["221.04","spoken can't hold back now can "],["224.319","you so Samuel told him everything he had "],["228.08","nothing from him and he "],["230.56","said it is the Lord let him do what "],["234.239","seems good to him thus Samuel grew and "],["239.079","the Lord was with him and let none of "],["242.2","his words fail all Israel from Dan to "],["244.959","Bersa knew that Samuel was confirmed as "],["247.92","a prophet of the Lord and the Lord "],["250.64","appeared again at Shiloh because the "],["253.84","Lord

"],["463.039","people will think how embarrassing I've "],["464.879","never want that to happen to me and "],["466.52","everyone can imagine how that would feel "],["470.12","now for Eli that this is way worse than "],["472.08","cheating consider the historical setting "],["474.759","consider the context for a moment Eli's "],["477","who he's the high priest he's the "],["481","spiritual leader he's their "],["483.44","representative before God think about "],["486.879","how you'd feel if our nation's president "],["489","some representative did something really "],["490.96","embarrassing and got caught doing "],["492.479","something very shameful it would "],["494.159","embarrass all of us it would upset you "],["496.44","you'd want them to step down whoever's

people "],["508.319","are going to mock you because of them "],["510.4","but with Eli it's even wer than that "],["513.039","because Eli is representing them before "],["515.919","God "],["517.32","Almighty if he's doing something "],["519.2","shameful before God it reflects on the "],["522.12","entire nation before God that's the "],["525.04","exact opposite of what he's supposed to "],["526.959","be doing Eli has a direct impact on the "],["529.92","nation's relationship with God it will "],["531.8","be apparent to all that this "],["533.32","relationship right now is really not "],["535.92","going well "],["540.16","that's why the word of the Lord was "],["542.12","rare that's why nobody was hearing from "],["544.32","God that's why God wasn't "],["546.839","around he wasn't there helping the "],["549.64","nation as we "],["552.16","love God does the same thing in the New "],["554.32","Testament too First Timothy 5 it tells "],["556.68","us against an elder received not an "],["558.36","accusation but before two or three "],["560.92","Witnesses them that "],["564.36","sin them that sin rebuked before all "],["568.839","that others may also fear I charge thee "],["572","before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and "],["574.44","the elect angels that you observe these "],["576.2","things without preferring one another "],["578.68","doing nothing imp

"],["589.56","leaders of the church if they continue "],["591.92","in habitual sin they are to be rebuked "],["594.6","in the presence of all so that they all "],["598.2","will be fearful of "],["600.56","sinning you see the tendency for people "],["603","is to assume that the person in charge "],["605.36","is there because they are "],["607.44","preferred right they're got some sort of "],["610.279","skill or Talent or some sort of you know "],["613.44","good moral character about them and "],["617","since they are preferred they "],["619.6","are deserving they are entitled to "],["623.6","preferential "],["625.72","treatments and to a certain extent you "],["627.959","do get some preferential IAL treatment "],["630.68","being the high priest or even being a "],["632.64","pastor you get a title and then people "],["634.68","are really nice and respectful to you "],["636.959","people are kind and generous and and do "],["639.72","lots of of of just

me and and everyone's very giving "],["651.92","very very "],["653.079","giving but it is "],["655.32","not it is never to be understood that "],["658.44","since you are "],["659.839","preferred it means that you can sin "],["663.6","since God prefers me I can somehow get "],["666.519","away with my sin no God does not prefer "],["670.92","sin God never wants sin to be he does "],["674.92","not brush it aside he does not look the "],["677.24","other way he does not say ah it's no big "],["679.72","deal he will forgive it he will atone "],["682.76","for it he will cleanse us from it but "],["685","he'll never say I accept your sin that "],["688.16","is a lie going on many churches in our "],["690.24","country that we just need to let people "],["692.72","come in and accept who they

shouldn't have it's really "],["294.24","hard to take it away from them isn't it "],["298","in first samuel chapter 2 we have the "],["299.84","sons of eli in some of the most "],["301.84","important "],["302.96","most powerful positions in of leadership "],["305.6","in the nation they weren't voted or "],["307.68","elected into these positions they got "],["309.44","them because of who their

"],["559.12","what his plan is for all of humanity so "],["561.44","what I want to do today is I want to "],["563.399","touch on the theological implications of "],["566.04","this Messianic prophecy what does a "],["568.279","Messianic prophecy teach us about God "],["572.2","it's important why well first of all the "],["575","Messianic prophecy illustrates to us "],["577.2","that the Bible is just a very unique "],["579.72","book the authors were given the words "],["582.959","for this book under the inspiration of "],["584.88","the Holy Spirit now it's important when "],["587.399","we use a word from the Bible that we "],["590.56","don't superimpose our English meaning "],["593.36","upon it we need to make sure that we "],["595.16","stick with Biblical definitions when "],["597.079","we're using biblical terms now in the "],["599.519","English we would use the word "],["601.839","inspiration in reference to what "],["605.12","creative feelings uh that the the music "],["608.24","that the girls did earlier that was "],["609.88","inspirational right the the uh I went "],["612.44","and saw this this performance this actor "],["614.839","the their whole performance that that "],["616.64","inspired me right we use it inspiration "],["619.92","to mean something compels us to some "],["623.16","positive action or some emotion right "],["625.72","something that we're feeling or you know "],["627.36","motivates us to to do something POS "],["629.16","positive but that definition falls short "],["633.04","when it comes to talking about what the "],["636.2","authors when scripture says the authors "],["638.56","were speaking under and writing under "],["640.2","inspiration of the holy spirit it's not "],["642.12","just a positive act or an enhanced "],["644.839","feeling of awe when we're talking about "],["646.839","the Bible inspiration and here is a a "],["650","doctrinal uh definition for you you want "],["652.36","to write this down inspiration is the "],["655.279","work of the Holy Spirit by which through "],["658.32","the instrument it of the whole "],["660","personality and the literary talents of "],["662.04","the human authors he constitutes the "],["664.6","words of the Bible in its entirety as "],["667.44","his written word to men and therefore of "],["670.2","divine Authority and without error in "],["673.36","its original manuscripts now there's a "],["675.399","lot in there I don't have to time to "],["676.8","unpack and explain that whole definition "],["679.04","but it's a very unique process "],["681.32","inspiration it's a very unique process "],["683.519","where he has taken this person and he is "],["687.76","not just kind of possess ing them and "],["689.76","forcing them to write something down "],["692.16","rather their personalities their talents "],["695.839","their writing styles are are there right "],["699.8","you you know that the different authors "],["701.16","have different styles and you can see "],["702.72","well David's really different from how "],["705.04","Paul writes you know so you make those "],["706.8","observations but "],["708.2","nevertheless it is from God it is God's "],["712.399","holy word that is coming out onto the "],["714.959","paper uh therefore it is a div with "],["718.04","Divine Authority "],["719.519","the Bible has Divine Godly authority "],["722.24","over all things that it's speaking so "],["724.8","the Bible "],["726.279","is the only inspired book how many other "],["730.639","inspired books are there around the "],["731.92","world there's not there is only the "],["735.399","Bible "],["736.72","consequently this stands as the standard "],["740.24","by which all other words and insights "],["742.44","are to be compared the Bible is "],["744.639","authoritative and supersedes all laws "],["747.16","and dogmas Constitution and Covenants "],["750.079","reasons and religions it's Superior to "],["754.199","everything that's why if our government "],["757.56","makes unbiblical laws or something "],["759.8","contrary to the word of God we say it's "],["762.199","better to obey God than to obey man all "],["766.8","other religions or teachings or "],["769","philosophies that contradict or contrary "],["771.04","to the teaching of the word of God are "],["774.16","wrong this is right because this came "],["777.88","from God "],["781.56","question what's our evidence that "],["785.16","this came from God how do we back that "],["788.199","claim up how do you how do you prove "],["789.72","that just because Pastor "],["791.32","Rob dogmatically said so that's good "],["794.6","enough that's good enough for many of "],["795.519","you right "],["797.399","that's okay there there's part of it I'm "],["800.24","going to give you uh some of the stuff "],["801.68","and I actually handed you out a little "],["803.6","bit of information that you can use the "],["805.88","the first one there's a number of "],["807.56","reasons why but the first one is the uh "],["811.04","factual "],["812.16","accuracy of the text here's here's an "],["815.199","example listed in front of you of "],["817.88","amazing scientific accurate statements "],["820.32","made in the word of God that predate "],["822.76","natural man's discovery of these facts "],["825.079","if you went back and you saw when these "],["826.88","authors wrote these things and then when "],["830.04","science and man discovered these things "],["831.959","apart from the Bible you'd notice that "],["833.36","these were done and stated hundreds of "],["835.24","years before people even could figure "],["837.399","this stuff out so that's interesting and "],["841.199","that's evidence isn't it it's accurate "],["845.079","uh on top of these factual accuracies "],["847.88","about uh these events there's also "],["850.16","people and places dates and "],["852.92","Antiquities uh there's the nation of "],["855.04","Israel itself which stands there as a "],["858.079","physical evidence you know it's kind of "],["860.199","a bigue "],["861.959","obvious point in Jerusalem there it is "],["864.759","let's go visit it you know all those "],["866.48","things listed in the scripture you can "],["868.04","find them "],["869.88","uh every once in a while you know that "],["871.279","I'll throw up some picture of something "],["873.12","that's found in archaeology some uh "],["876.92","artifact or some piece of uh art that "],["880","agrees some writing that agrees other "],["882.32","sources uh in Antiquities agree with the "],["885.279","Bible so that's one that's one piece of "],["887.759","evidence I'm going to give you a list of "],["890.04","things and uh they all build the case "],["893.44","together second list of how we know that "],["895.8","this is from God is the uh the dynamic "],["898.88","nature of the "],["900.16","text what's that mean means the Bible "],["903.04","changes lives right it's powerful it "],["906.839","that's a little bit subjective but "],["908.12","nevertheless that's very compelling when "],["910.72","you look at how somebody lived their "],["913.12","lives prior to obeying the Bible and "],["916.44","living and believing it and you look at "],["918.92","somebody's life after they come to trust "],["922.079","in the Lord and believe Bible and Obey "],["924.199","it there's a huge difference right and "],["926.8","you you many of you can testify to that "],["929.04","fact that before I knew the word and "],["930.68","trusted in Jesus to afterwards there's "],["932.68","been a big change in my life since Jesus "],["935.839","came into my heart that's uh that's "],["937.8","definitely evidence another piece of "],["940.36","evidence that the Bible is inspired is "],["942.36","it claims to be there's over 3,800 times "],["944.88","in the Old Testament that the authors "],["946.759","say thus saith the Lord now lots of "],["949.48","books could claim it but it it it just "],["951.44","so happens that not a lot do there's a "],["953.519","few books that claim to be from God but "],["955.36","not that many but it claims it over and "],["957.8","over again another proof that the Bible "],["960","is the word of God is the longevity of "],["962.959","its existence despite all of the attacks "],["965.92","and attempts to destroy it that's just "],["967.44","miraculous that it has survived all "],["970.199","these attacks ancient empires tried to "],["972.839","destroy it the Greeks tried to destroy "],["974.92","it the Romans tried to destroy it it was "],["977","illegal for many years in communist "],["978.959","countries around the world it's illegal "],["980.88","today in many Islamic countries around "],["982.8","the world it's been outlawed it's been "],["984.759","banned it's been destroyed and yet it "],["987","just keeps getting in it just keeps "],["989.8","surviving and it keeps getting into "],["991.88","countries people are threatened and "],["993.24","killed simply for owning it and yet they "],["995.24","gladly die for having it we remember "],["998.12","back in history that John wickliff he "],["999.839","wanted to uh translate the Bible the "],["1002.68","Catholic church had it in Latin but the "],["1004.519","people were speaking English in his day "],["1006.44","and age where he lived it was probably "],["1008","England yeah he was from England and uh "],["1009.88","so he wanted to uh put the Bible in in "],["1011.88","everyone's language so you know so they "],["1013.56","could read it and have a copy of it and "],["1015.279","the church didn't want them to do that "],["1016.6","so they burn him at the stake for trying "],["1018.72","to give people the word of God in their "],["1021.839","own "],["1022.72","language uh and that that happens time "],["1025.039","and time again that tyrannical Powers "],["1026.76","both religious and secular have denied "],["1029.36","people from reading it but yet they "],["1031","translate it and they read it and it "],["1033.16","changes lives every time it happens it's "],["1035.24","the number one bestseller in the history "],["1037.319","of mankind that's miraculous time and "],["1040.24","time again you know strips everybody "],["1041.959","else so all of this is our evidence that "],["1044.839","the Bible is inspired but all of that is "],["1047.64","still somewhat Circ "],["1049.72","stantial we do have a Smoking Gun we do "],["1053.24","have this Ironclad evidence what is "],["1057.12","that there you go what we're talking "],["1059.44","about today in 1st Samuel chapter 2 "],["1061.24","ver10 "],["1062.84","predictive prophecy things spoken in the "],["1066.36","word of God years before they happen and "],["1069.559","yet they come true in the future at a "],["1071.72","later date sometimes hundreds of years "],["1073.84","later sometimes thousands of year later "],["1076.52","they come true just as the Bible authors "],["1079.84","prophesied how can it do that because it "],["1082.76","has God as the author and he says it and "],["1086.559","then years later he does it and that's "],["1089.72","what we have here Hannah is prophesying "],["1091.88","about the king about Israel having a "],["1095.039","king did she get that right did Israel "],["1097.64","get a king that's right so she was right "],["1100.4","in her prophecy all the prophecies and "],["1102.72","predictions in Scripture that have come "],["1104.6","to pass are our Ironclad evidence that "],["1107.4","the word is from the Lord and it is he "],["1111.679","that teaches us these things because God "],["1113.64","is outside of time God is the beginning "],["1115.88","and the end the first and the last the

"],["355.759","to feel much like praising actually "],["358.319","that's the last thing you feel like "],["359.8","doing you you'd rather not do praise "],["362.44","because you're not feeling it that's one "],["364.84","of the biggest challenges every Sunday "],["368.68","for our praise teams on top of wanting "],["370.4","to sing and play the songs properly and "],["373.52","you know wanting it to sound good on top "],["376.479","of the getting the sermon ready and "],["379.16","making sure it's accurate "],["381.52","information more than on top of all that "],["384.039","is wanting you to feel it it's important "],["388.4","that you feel "],["390.319","what's going on up here because once our "],["393.199","emotions are connected with the "],["394.919","information we remember it so much "],["397.28","better it resonates with an entire being "],["400.72","when our intellect and our "],["403.199","emotions are joined together with this "],["407.24","information I will be completely honest "],["409.88","with you I was not feeling like "],["411.759","preaching this week I almost gave "],["413.84","Brother Richard a call and gave him the "],["415.8","nod and put him on up here because I "],["417.52","have had the flu uh since Wednesday and "],["421.12","I didn't feel like studying or reading "],["422.879","or thinking I just felt like sleeping "],["425.319","that's all I was doing and Ricky and I "],["426.919","stayed home and just slapped and coughed "],["428.879","on each other for the whole "],["431","week so if this comes together in any "],["433.44","way you get anything you feel anything "],["435.68","you can just thank the holy spirit "],["437.12","because he's the one that that's "],["438.919","speaking here this morning all right "],["441.28","let's go into chapter two verse number "],["442.879","one we're not going to do this whole "],["444.36","Psalm today but let's do one verse I "],["447.16","managed to pull one verse together here "],["448.68","for you "],["450.039","Hannah prayed and said my "],["452.96","heart exalts in the Lord my horn is "],["456.879","exalted in the Lord my mouth speaks "],["459.759","boldly against my enemies because I "],["463.56","rejoice in your "],["465.56","selfish my heart my horn my mouth I "],["470.479","understand what a heart to the mouth is "],["473.24","but what does she mean her horn is she a "],["476.599","unicorn she part deer "],["481.199","the horn used primarily by the "],["483.639","Israelites was a "],["485.599","chofar there you go this picture of one "],["487.68","it was made of a Ram's Horn here's a "],["489.68","better picture I like this one there's a "],["491.759","one that's been allowed to grow for a "],["493.28","while and cut that thing off and you've "],["495.879","got a really really good horn on that "],["498.72","one now this is just a simple detail in "],["502.84","the text right she says her horn but I "],["505.72","want you to understand the term and what "],["508.319","it meant to the Hebrew "],["510.759","so you can really grasp this one word "],["513.32","this morning maybe it'll bless you but "],["515.56","the RAM with the horn came off with the "],["517.479","ram the ram of course is a "],["520.399","male cheat right the ram was used for a "],["525.8","Sacrifice by Abraham in the place of "],["528.44","Isaac Abraham was supposed to sacrifice "],["531.44","his only son Isaac as an offering to the "],["534.12","Lord but God substituted the ram in his "],["538.64","place and in that moment Not only was "],["542.2","Isaac saved but in essence the entire "],["545.2","nation of Israel was saved when that Ram "],["549.32","was substituted for them all the future "],["551.839","generations of Israel Jacob his 12 sons "],["555.16","King David even the Lord Jesus Christ "],["558.56","all the promises of God all the "],["560.64","covenants were made for Isaac and for "],["565.04","his seed so the ram first and foremost "],["569.56","is a symbol of the Salvation of the Lord "],["573.2","for his people now the horns were blown "],["576.399","in scripture for all kinds of reasons if "],["578.64","you read the Old Testament the tunes "],["580.48","communicated different messages and "],["582.64","Times of harvest and Times of "],["584.2","celebrations and times to break Camp "],["587.2","times to take out the trash you know "],["589.04","horns were all kinds of things religious "],["591.12","festivals at the temple they used horns "],["593.48","call to battle they used a horn when "],["596.48","they were going into battle but one "],["598.079","thing is clear you don't don't blow a "],["599.6","horn to not be heard right the point of "],["603","a horn is to go public with your message "],["607.48","now what's really interesting is that "],["610.12","the first time the nation heard the horn "],["612.36","blown in a public manner with symbolic "],["614.76","meaning for them was in Exodus chapter "],["618.48","19 the word trumpet is not even used in "],["621.2","scripture until Exodus 19 this is the "],["624.279","first time it appears the word a trumpet "],["626.959","is this word in the English but in the "],["629.2","text the Hebrew text that says the chaar "],["631.959","now what's interesting about this "],["634.2","instance we're going to look at in "],["635.399","Exodus 19 is who is blowing this "],["639","trumpet now I need you to stay with me "],["643.639","on this point I'm going to make because "],["645.12","we're going to get a little deep here "],["647.36","but if you hang in there and you don't "],["649.959","fall asleep I I guarantee you're going "],["652.48","to get something really exciting out of "],["655.24","this point but let's go to Exodus 19 as "],["658.079","we want to uh just set the stage here uh "],["661.32","what is happening in Exodus "],["663.68","19 you "],["666.32","know yes it is Mount Si the nation has "],["670.2","left Egypt they've traveled to Mount Si "],["673.639","where they're now going to meet the Lord "],["676.36","for the first time and get the "],["678.56","loss so God uh let's pick it up in uh "],["683.92","verse number seven Moses came and called "],["686.76","the Elders of the people set before them "],["688.399","all the words the Lord had commanded the "],["690.639","people answered said all that the Lord "],["692.88","has spoken to us we will do Moses "],["695.12","brought back the words of the people to "],["697.279","the Lord the Lord said to "],["699.6","Moses behold I will come to you in a "],["702.839","thick Cloud so that the people may hear "],["707.639","when I speak with you and may also "],["710.399","believe in you forever then Moses told "],["713.56","the words of the people to the Lord the "],["715.68","Lord also said to Moses go to the people "],["718.399","consecrate them today and tomorrow let "],["720.519","them wash their garments and let them be "],["722.68","ready on the third day for on the third "],["724.88","day the Lord's going to come down on "],["727.36","Mount Si in the sight of all the people "],["729.839","you'll set the bounds of the people all "],["731.519","around saying beware that nobody goes up "],["733.44","to the mountain or touches the border of "],["735","it whoever touches the mountain will "],["736.12","surely be put to death no hand shall "],["738.839","touch him but he shall surely be stoned "],["740.88","or shot through whether it's Beast or "],["742.56","man they shall not live when the Rams "],["744.88","Horn sounds a long blast they shall come "],["747.48","up to the mountain "],["749.72","okay when they hear this Rams so Moses "],["752.399","went down to the mountain to the people "],["753.72","and consecrated the people and said ' "],["754.839","wash your garments he said be ready on "],["756.199","the third day do not go near a "],["758.48","woman so it came about the third day "],["761.56","when it was "],["762.72","morning that there was thunder and "],["766","lightning flashes and a thick Cloud upon "],["768.92","the mountain and a very loud trumpet "],["773.68","sounds so that all the people who were "],["776.199","in the camp trembled and Moses brought "],["777.959","the people out of the camp to meet God "],["781.16","and they stood at the foot of the "],["782.639","mountain now Mount sa was all in Smoke "],["786.04","because the Lord descended upon it in "],["788.6","Fire and its smoke ascended like the "],["792.12","smoke of a furnace and the whole "],["793.72","Mountain quaked violently then the sound "],["796.279","of the trumpet grew louder and "],["800.68","louder Excuse excuse "],["804.16","me louder and louder Moses spoke and God "],["808.88","answered him with "],["813.8","thunder what is evident in this text is "],["817.32","that the trumpet the chaar is coming "],["820.16","from the from the mountain right there's "],["823.24","Thunder and there's lightning and "],["824.72","there's cloud and there's this trumpet "],["827.399","and all of the language is telling us "],["829.079","it's all coming from the mountain "],["834.12","itself it's declaring "],["837.079","what the arrival of the arrival of God "],["842.199","God himself and it's violent and it's "],["845.68","terrifying and it's loud and that's the "],["848.72","first time the nation hears the "],["852.36","trumpet it's interesting as you go to "],["854.56","the Book of Revelation all the decrees "],["856.839","of God all the pronouncements are made "],["859.44","with the blowing of trumpets okay hang "],["863.12","on to that detail I want to give you "],["865.04","another detail and then we're going to "],["866.639","put

"],["292.08","this special vow for the lord "],["294.24","third uh the nazirite bow uh illustrates "],["297.28","to us separation the nazirite was "],["300.16","prohibited from touching any dead body "],["303.28","he must totally separate himself from "],["305.44","death dead things are seen as unclean "],["308.16","for natural uh hygienic reasons of "],["310.8","course but also uh just uh pertaining to "],["314","the law everything that dies dies "],["316.16","because of the "],["317.44","curse of sin "],["319.199","so there's an intentional separation "],["321.759","from

"],["459.039","realize well this is going to be "],["461.199","a bloodbath to get "],["463.12","all of this land from that wouldn't it "],["464.88","it's going to be "],["466.16","a long hard battle so that communicates "],["468.319","you that communicates to us a couple of "],["470.8","different things "],["472.639","it communicates that either god lied to "],["475.52","abraham "],["477.36","or he "],["478.479","just isn't strong enough to keep his "],["480.24","word "],["481.44","or "],["484.319","he's not "],["485.84","finished yet "],["488.08","he's not done "],["489.68","with "],["490.84","israel the fact that there is always "],["494.4","non-stop conflict intention in this part "],["498.479","of the world lends me to believe that "],["501.12","our adversary the devil satan works very "],["504.24","hard to keep this physical piece of real "],["507.199","estate under his control because he's "],["509.759","desperately trying to prevent god's word "],["512.56","from coming true the devil wants to "],["514.719","prove god to be a liar for if god can't "],["517.279","keep his word then he can't be god and "],["520.159","everything that god has promised to do "],["522.32","is something that satan tries to "],["524.72","stop that's why he's called the "],["527.2","adversary "],["528.72","right and you know that to be true in "],["530.48","your own life the things that god has "],["532.24","promised to bless the things that our "],["533.92","god has you've made vows before are the "],["536","things that get attacked like your "],["537.44","marriage and all of these things that "],["539.6","god likes to uh to promise and to bless "],["544.399","you know the devil thought he had the "],["545.68","nation dismantled for "],["547.64","1878 years israel did not exist on the "],["550.48","map but boom it sprung back up in 1948 "],["554.08","because god is not done his word does "],["557.36","not return void when god makes a promise "],["561.36","an unconditional covenant he intends to "],["564.8","keep it "],["565.839","so abraham lived around 2000 bc "],["569.6","according to the book of genesis he was "],["571.76","called by god we talked about this last "],["574.16","week pastor bob to leave his homeland to "],["576.48","go live in a place that god would show "],["578.399","him and abram lived as a nomad in i'll "],["582.8","go back

"],["971.279","was prophet priest and judge and nobody "],["972.88","ever done that before but it does tell "],["976","us in scripture that one day when the "],["977.92","messiah jesus christ returns
